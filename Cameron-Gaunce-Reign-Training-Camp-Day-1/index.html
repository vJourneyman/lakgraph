guys have been skating together now for
a little while
um what&rsquo;s the familiarity with with
everybody and how nice was it to kind of
start to see a little bit more of the
group form as the king starts to
officially cut down their roster a
little bit
A: I think today was great uh
last couple days we&rsquo;ve been skating and
it&rsquo;s relatively similar group so that
like you said the familiarity was
kind of already there but it&rsquo;s nice to
be officially part of it we went back to
our original numbers in the American
Hockey League guys are more
uh present if you will because again
when you&rsquo;re still considered big-league guys
are there&rsquo;s more longing for the
potential to obey there obviously is
still the
kind of the thought they want to get
called up you want to get brought back
but you also know that right now the
realities are set in a bit and that&rsquo;s
when you can start to really focus on
your present really focus on where you
are at the time being and I thought that
happened I think Marco, heider, and Schulz
have been doing an excellent job of
staying with us staying on top of us
making sure we understand that we&rsquo;re the
Ontario Reign right now and I thought
today was a great first
step</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Q: what&rsquo;s your impressions of Marco
starting to get to know him a little bit
better I know he&rsquo;s not a new coach for a
lot of guys they&rsquo;ve had familiarity but
you know what have you seen him do
that&rsquo;s maybe a little bit different
what&rsquo;s his style so far that you&rsquo;ve seen
A: uh I feel like he&rsquo;s extremely organized
which I love uh like we&rsquo;ve already had a
few conversations about a few dates down
the road and I absolutely loved
top of things has a plan in place so
there&rsquo;s no questioning any of that stuff
that again it&rsquo;s not to say that Chris
heide last year didn&rsquo;t have the same thing
but it&rsquo;s just different coming from a
new voice uh he&rsquo;s been the other thing
that you notice right away and talking
with Marco is a very caring person and I
think especially in the American Hockey League
that&rsquo;s very key to the players
understand that the coach not only cares
about winning and his own career when he
carries with the player uh where some
disconnect can sometimes go on when
players are thinking no one&rsquo;s
looks like Marco really cares about each
and every one of us it&rsquo;s present and
it&rsquo;s something that just adds to the
overall experience as him as a coach</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Q: you&rsquo;ve been around this league for for a
while now how do you feel like the
talent level is on this roster maybe
when you when you see at the beginning
of the year I know that last year the
team felt like they had a lot of talent
too but when you look at you know some
of the new pieces that have been added
in some new faces where do you feel like
the talent level of the roster is at?
A: I
think the talent level is high like again it&rsquo;s we
don&rsquo;t have the full roster right yet
with with the Kings still having a few
guys which means we&rsquo;re gonna be getting
even more talented players so it&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re at
a stage already where we&rsquo;ve got a team
that can compete and I think adding a
couple more guys from the Kings will just
kind of push us over that top the best
thing about the American Hockey League
on any given day your roster could be
completely overhauled we went one
weekend last year with one forward
playing defense along with three
call-ups and we only had five of us so
the next two weekends later we had 8 D, we
had too many so it can change in the
blink of an eye due to injuries call-ups
things beyond our control so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s
hard not to look into the future you
want to kind of see the type of Team you
can put together but you have to worry
about the team you have the team we have
right now is a good team we can
absolutely compete and with the systems
that we have in place the better we play
them the better we&rsquo;re going to be as a
group</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Q: for you why&rsquo;d you make the
decision to come back you know what are
some of the factors that that went into
that decision and how excited are you
for for a new slate your new season
A: I was excited at the opportunity to come
back just because of my career I bounced
around quite
it&rsquo;s going to be my third year with the
same organization what&rsquo;s going
familiarity as we talked about the first
question it&rsquo;s something that was very
important for me like I come in this
season the coaching staff already knows
exactly who I am as a person who I am as
a player so we already have that we
already have that piece of this they
know what to expect from me they I know
what to expect from them I understand my
role on and off the ice and that just
makes me more comfortable than my
ability to grow is that much more now
that the basis is down my ability to
grow as both the personal player is more
I&rsquo;m more capable to do that so I think
that was the biggest thing was just
coming back being part of the
organization feeling wanted uh because
again someone like myself
there&rsquo;s times you just want to feel
relevant you want to feel like you&rsquo;re
wanted this was an organization that
expressed want and that was something
that I really enjoyed</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Q: last thing this is
a bit of a condensed Camp you only have
a few days you get one preseason game
and then all of a sudden next week
you&rsquo;re going to be gearing up for the
home opener already so what are some of
the things that that you feel that the
team needs to work on in these days to
make sure they&rsquo;re ready to start the
season and have a good start
A: I think
making sure that things that
there&rsquo;s certain tenets that we&rsquo;re really trying to harp on
that&rsquo;s the key obviously you can start
building on a few other things but if we
can really start
coming together as a group in terms of
understanding where each other going to
be we need to be a predictable team like
obviously we&rsquo;ve got a guy like <a class="internal-link broken">Tynan</a>
he&rsquo;s unpredictable because he&rsquo;s that
good but not everyone can play like like
times so if we can become more
predictable as a group earlier on like
this week
starting coming in this upcoming weekend
and then moving into the opening slate
of games without predictability can just
make you play better within it because
then all of a sudden things start
happening quicker that&rsquo;s where teams
that&rsquo;s where the term Pace really comes
into play I
plays with pace is one that knows what&rsquo;s
happening with each other moving the
fast skating fastest paces and just
skating fast because if that was the
case we&rsquo;ve got <a href=/Austin-Wagner rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Austin-Wagner>Austin Wagner</a> who&rsquo;s
fastest skater of the league
but playing with pace is playing as a
group moving in five man units and
understanding where each other they&rsquo;re
going to be so the better we can do that
earlier on I think the more successful I
would start of the year because you
can&rsquo;t win the season you can&rsquo;t win the
regular season in the opening month but
you can put yourself in a big hole.
Cameron thanks very much for joining us
and we look forward to talking to you
throughout the season of course anytime</p></blockquote></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/2022-2023-Pre-Season/ data-ctx="Cameron Gaunce - Reign Training Camp Day 1" data-src=/2022-2023-Pre-Season class=internal-link>2022-2023 Pre-Season</a></li><li><a href=/Cameron-Gaunce/ data-ctx="Cameron Gaunce - Reign Training Camp Day 1" data-src=/Cameron-Gaunce class=internal-link>Cameron Gaunce</a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://lakings-graph.com/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by John White using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, Â© 2022</p><ul><li><a href=https://lakings-graph.com/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/vJourneyman>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/vJourneyman>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
