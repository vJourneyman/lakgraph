In addition, Aaron Cooney has been named Manager of Hockey Communications and Justin Cummings is the Hockey Communications Specialist.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It was done, basically done over the summer. There was never really an official announcement, just because we didn’t feel we needed to on that aspect, but yes, that was taken care of there, probably immediately after the season was over. &ndash; <a href=/Rob-Blake rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Rob-Blake>Rob Blake</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Nelson Emerson
Emerson has spent the last 15 seasons in the Kings organization, most recently serving as Director of Player Personnel from 2017-18 to 2021-22. Prior to that, he spent the previous 10 seasons in the Player Development department. He was originally named to the coaching staff on July 10, 2006 and spent the two seasons as an Assistant Coach after serving as a Coaches Aide in 2003-04. The native of Hamilton, Ontario appeared in 771 career games, including 124 with the Kings from 2000-02, and recorded 488 points (195-293) overall. Originally selected by the St. Louis Blues in the third round (44th overall) of the 1985 NHL Entry Draft, the forward also had 22 points (7-15=22) in 40 playoff games. While at Bowling Green State University of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA), Emerson was a two-time All-American, a three-time CCHA All-Star, and a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award three times (1988-90). He remains the school’s all-time leading scorer with 294 points.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Glen Murray
Murray has held multiple roles in the Player Development department dating back to 2016, most recently serving as Director of Player Development since 2018. The former Kings forward joined the front office on a part-time basis in 2011-12 during the club’s first Stanley Cup championship season. After four-plus seasons as a consultant, he formally joined the Player Development department in 2016. A native of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Murray played 16 seasons in the NHL including his time with the Kings from 1996-02. He played in 1,009 regular-season games and recorded 651 points (337-314=651) with Los Angeles, Boston and Pittsburgh. A two-time All-Star, Murray recorded a career-high in 2002-03 with 44 goals, 48 assists and 92 points in 82 games. He scored as many as 28 goals in a season five different times including a team-high 29 goals with the Kings during the 1997-98 season. His 41 goals in 2001-02 were second-most in the NHL.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Derik Johnson
Johnson joined the Kings in 2018 and has spent the last four seasons as an assistant video coach while also working with players on the ice after morning skates and filling in on the bench for some games last season. Prior to that, he was a video coach with the Bakersfield Condors of the American Hockey League for the 2017-18 season. Johnson was a defenseman at the University of Minnesota-Duluth and tallied 17 points (2-15=17) in 108 games over four seasons. He went on to play professionally for three seasons, tallying 29 points (8-21=29) in 129 ECHL appearances (Missouri Mavericks and Reading Royals) from 2014-17. In 2015-16, he made his AHL debut, skating in four games with the Springfield Falcons.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Andy Johnson
Johnson joins the Kings after spending the last five seasons serving as general manager and director of scouting for the Sioux City Musketeers of the USHL. This past season, Johnson led Sioux City to their first Clark Cup Championship in two decades and was named USHL General Manager of the Year. Johnson’s career spans nine seasons, all in the USHL, where he’s held positions in various capacities, including scout, director of scouting, assistant general manager and general manager split between Sioux City (2017-22), the Waterloo Black Hawks (2014-17) and Muskegon Lumberjacks (2013-14).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sara Hickmann
Dr. Hickmann brings over 20 years of sport psychology experience to the Kings, while also serving as Team Psychologist and Director of Mental Health and Wellness for the Los Angeles Clippers. Prior to her time at the Clippers, Dr. Hickmann held similar positions with the Brooklyn Nets (2010-14) and New York Jets (2009-2014). She worked for the NFL league office as the Director of Player Assistance Programs (2004-2009) and managed the clinical side for the NFL’s Personal Conduct Program (2006-2022). Her other professional experiences include working as an embedded Psychologist with Naval Special Warfare/Navy SEALS in Coronado, CA and creating a Cognitive Agility Training course for the Special Operations Central Command in Tampa, FL.
