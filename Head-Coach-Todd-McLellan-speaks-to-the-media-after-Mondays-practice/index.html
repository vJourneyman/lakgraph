season&rsquo;s Camp was about establishing the
identity and this year it&rsquo;s more about
rediscovering from what you guys had
last year how have you seen that kind of
progress through the last preseason game
and to now today&rsquo;s Final practice?</p><p>A: well I think that&rsquo;s a process that&rsquo;s
going to continue not just for the Kings
but for for every team that&rsquo;s beginning
the season you&rsquo;re never the finished
product on day one
and um I do think I&rsquo;ve mentioned to a
few guys that day one is often uh
you know it&rsquo;s either too high or too low
or or whatever it is day two is really
where you
um
start to see what your team is made of
and and how it rolls out but
we&rsquo;re at day one it&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re going to
make it important it obviously is we&rsquo;d
like to see our identity come out we&rsquo;d
like to see our structure come out we&rsquo;d
like to see individuals find their game
within our game
there&rsquo;s areas that we&rsquo;ve concentrated a
little bit more on throughout training
camp
than others and we should see
improvements in those areas
or at least
progression towards it pardon me
um but it will take some time and um
we&rsquo;re no different than any other team
in the league</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Q: Todd you talked about identity.
The last three games were high scoring
games, not really your identity
Is there a lot to clean up defensively
or is that just an offshoot of preseason?</p><p>A: there are some things to clean up
defensively
um some of it&rsquo;s game management some of
its
um you know situational that we&rsquo;ve got
individual mistake here and there not
necessarily the team as a whole
uh
some of its games five six and seven of
exhibition season
you know whatever that means I think you
guys can figure that out
um
you know we have to remember who we are
and what our identity is and play
towards that so
at the end of the day at the end of the
day that&rsquo;s what will take us to where we
want to go and if we start to stray from
it
uh we&rsquo;ll probably learn some valuable
lessons along the way and we&rsquo;ll have to
reel some things in but that&rsquo;s who we
are and that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ll have to play</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Q: you uh you took a while before you were
able to define the identity of the team
what about now what is it</p><p>A: well we should be really hard to play
against because we&rsquo;re a structured team
we have some predictability
um to each other not necessarily to the
opposition in what we do uh our checking
skills are in our DNA and we value that
and when I say we usually starts through
the championship players that have been
here before
um and it trickles all the way down
you can be a really sound
responsible trusting
player on the ice and still produce
offense <a href=/Phillip-Danault rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Phillip-Danault>Phil Danault</a> was that
last year <a href=/Adrian-Kempe rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Adrian-Kempe>Adrian Kempe</a> for the most part
is that
um so start there and the offense will
come later on
do we want to score more goals of course
we do and we we have to
but if we&rsquo;re chasing goals all over the
place and giving up too many we&rsquo;re
probably uh
you know going to be in trouble</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Q: on <a href=/Brandt-Clarke rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Brandt-Clarke>Brandt</a>
we&rsquo;ve talked about obviously you know
what he&rsquo;s shown in Camp on the ice the
skills that he has and the growth that&rsquo;s
obviously there also I wrote how much
does his
does this confidence that there&rsquo;s even a
seems to be a little bit of swagger a
little little attitude whatsoever how
much does that even
carried him
through this camp and to this point
where maybe he can be playing tomorrow
night</p><p>A: I I think that that has helped him
immensely
um
he knows who Brandt knows who Brandt is he
knows what&rsquo;s in his toolbox in his tool
kit
um he hasn&rsquo;t played with fear and what I
mean by fear is not the the physical
part but fear of
of
erroring on the ice he makes plays he
attempts plays uh he&rsquo;s been very
coachable throughout training camp
um you know potentially away from the
King&rsquo;s family I could see where that
confidence or that Swagger may be
misread
in other environments
um where it could hurt him but so far
not in ours not one bit</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Q: Todd, the last few preseason games it&rsquo;s like a
lot of goals in the second period I
think I counted 10 goals against
anything that tendencies that were
happening or not happening</p><p>A: um while we get off we&rsquo;ve had good
starts in the exhibition season
we get to the break we come out and we
we seem to take
penalties
penalties that aren&rsquo;t really important
in anything that&rsquo;s going on away from
the puck in the o-zone the neutral zone
I&rsquo;d like to think that that can be
cleaned up
those are individuals more than team
mistakes I&rsquo;d like to think that gets
cleaned up and um early in the year that
can swing the momentum a big way but
other than that I don&rsquo;t have
anything else to put my finger on</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Q: You just mentioned <a href=/Phillip-Danault rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Phillip-Danault>Danault</a> and <a href=/Adrian-Kempe rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Adrian-Kempe>Kempe</a> who
both had career seasons last year
what have you seen or what do you know
about them that means you to believe
that could be the norm as opposed to be
except that being exceptions</p><p>A: well I have a longer track record with
Adrian and to me where Adrian the day I
walked in the door and Adrian was there
till now he&rsquo;s gone from boy to man in my
opinion in his
responsibility for his own game has gone
up immense immensely and I see that in
them so I&rsquo;m confident that confidence
that he can carry on is he a 35 goal
scorer I sure hope so
but I know he&rsquo;s a 20-minute player for
sure most nights and that&rsquo;s just as
important as being a a 35 goal scorer
with Phil
um
Phil&rsquo;s ability to play in structure and
read plays and be responsible for the
other 20 minutes a night
um has always been there his breakout
was the offensive part and I think if he
continues to do
um the things he did on the the
defensive side of the puck he&rsquo;s going to
get those opportunities offensively as
well so they haven&rsquo;t shown signs that
they can&rsquo;t repeat</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Q: What are you looking to bring out of
<a href=/Quinton-Byfield rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Quinton-Byfield>Quinton Byfield</a>&rsquo;s game how would you
assess where he&rsquo;s at and what you want
to see from him, I guess a blueprint this year</p><p>A: well a year ago we were putting him in a
cast and we were putting them on the
shelf for
four months four and a half months
we&rsquo;re not doing that now so he&rsquo;s way
further ahead he&rsquo;s bigger he&rsquo;s stronger
he&rsquo;s skating better he&rsquo;s over top of
pucks a lot more
um
the evaluation tool I think on the
exteriors all these goals and assists
and can he be that or whatever he in my
mind is already a better player now than
he was last year at this point
now we&rsquo;ve got to let him play and find
his way and
um
the rest should happen as the night goes
on but as the year goes on Pardon Me not
tonight but as the year goes on</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Q: Todd with <a href=/Kevin-Fiala rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Kevin-Fiala>Fiala</a>, he might be the only new player in your
lineup tomorrow night
now that you&rsquo;ve seen him in the
preseason games practices for a couple
of weeks is there anything about his
game that maybe he didn&rsquo;t know that
you&rsquo;re really appreciating</p><p>A: um
there were
assumptions that we made based on his
Point totals and video and that type of
stuff you know the the hockey sense the
sense of timing space finish
those assumptions to this point were
good assumptions on our behalf because
we&rsquo;ve seen that so it&rsquo;s the overall
package and it&rsquo;s just
throughout exhibition season confirming
what we believed we were getting and
what we
had viewed in the past but now we see it
full time or if that makes any sense but
that&rsquo;s that would be my answer for that</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Q: the <a href=/Viktor-Arvidsson rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Viktor-Arvidsson>Viktor Arvidsson</a> uh did he come back
sooner than you as anticipated and how
did he look off the other off the other
night in terms of being able to jump in
the front</p><p>A: um not necessarily sooner uh Victor&rsquo;s
been on a
from the day he was ruled out last year
in whatever it was April May
till now he&rsquo;s followed pretty much the
calendar of events that we thought would
happen
um and he&rsquo;s worked really hard
to get himself back into the lineup his
eagerness and excitement about being
back in is really healthy I thought he
had a real good game
um no one one game
he&rsquo;s going to have to do it
over and over again but he completes the
identity of that line
they spent a lot of time talking and and
analyzing how they play that&rsquo;s I think
makes them effective
and he shown no signs of
fatigue or anything else negative</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Q: this is the healthiest the roster has
been a year
gee thanks
is it harder or easier to make decisions
now
based on everyone being available</p><p>A: um
it&rsquo;s a mix some players made it easy
some are making it harder some are
making it clear both ways for and
against their play
um
I I would be lying if I said I wasn&rsquo;t
concerned about bringing all the banged
up guys back at once <a href=/Viktor-Arvidsson rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Viktor-Arvidsson>Arvy</a>&rsquo;s played one
game <a href=/Sean-Durzi rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Sean-Durzi>Durzi</a>&rsquo;s played two
you know these guys are coming back in
without a lot of
um training camp time
other teams are in that situation too so
we just got to figure it out as we go</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Q: when you were introduced as head coach
you introduced the marathon metaphor now
it&rsquo;s the start of year four how far
along is the club in that metaphorical
Marathon compared to where you&rsquo;d like</p><p>A: well we&rsquo;ve settled into the race now
we&rsquo;ve climbed some hills we&rsquo;ve got in
some valleys
I think in marathons there&rsquo;s
um
players or players Runners that break
away and sometimes the pack catches them
again I would say we&rsquo;re in that pack and
um you know we&rsquo;re no longer in miles one
through five we&rsquo;re way further into it
but if crossing the finish line and
putting a medal around your neck is the
