Iâ€™ve always thought that evaluating young players at that time of the year can be a little misleading. Itâ€™s game 10-through-25 that you really get the true evaluation, because it gets a little heavier, harder, tighter checking, goalies tend to have found their games.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>No one expected us to get to that point last year. Surprised a lot of teams. Thatâ€™s not happening this year. Teams are fully prepared. Weâ€™re not getting backup goaltenders, weâ€™re getting starters, and teams donâ€™t waste any minutes when they play against us now, and thatâ€™s exactly what we hoped for as a team. Thatâ€™s what we wanted to be playing â€“ those type of games night after night, and that playoff series helped us earn the right to do that, and now weâ€™ve got to live up to those expectations and responsibilities.
It was a pretty close series. There were a few games that didnâ€™t go our way. Iâ€™m sure they would say the same thing. But when you play seven games, itâ€™s not because it was lopsided one way or another. There were moments where they had some other gamebreakers take over, and willed them to a win, and at the end of the day, thatâ€™s probably the difference.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Over the past few years weâ€™ve gone from a one-line to a two-line and now maybe a three-line team that scores, and thatâ€™s not to diminish what Lizotteâ€™s line does on a nightly basis. They work really hard and create, so thatâ€™s what Kevinâ€™s done for us.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>a sign to a coach or to your teammates that â€˜boy, we might not be here,â€™ because if you donâ€™t know what youâ€™re doing three or four seconds in, you wonder sometimes.
But our groupâ€™s been pretty good with that. Itâ€™s not always mental. Sometimes you make physical mistakes. Weâ€™ve got some things that weâ€™ve got to fix and we talked about. Weâ€™re hoping to get some of those things done tonight, but whenever weâ€™ve addressed the team and tried to repair some things, they usually have a pretty good focus on that area of the game, so we expect it to happen again.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I think sometimes when guys come in theyâ€™re overwhelmed with the speed or the pace. I didnâ€™t see that in [<a href=/Jaret-Anderson-Dolan rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Jaret-Anderson-Dolan>Jaret Anderson-Dolan</a>]â€™s case because he worked so hard and he was ready for it. Also, tough circumstances when the team isnâ€™t really connecting as we had been coming into that game. You get caught in the mess, if you will, but he did an admirable job.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>They did an outstanding job not only against the Oilers, but keep in mind we were playing short from game four [of the season]. That put us in a situation of 78 games without some of our top defensemen, and it allowed Sean Durzi to evolve, it allowed Jordan Spence to arrive, Jacob Moverare. These types of players came in and pinch hit, and when they did that they were outstanding. It gave us as an organization an opportunity to evaluate our depth, to know what we have. I donâ€™t want to say it was a blessing in disguise because nobody wants to play without Doughty, Edler, Walker â€“ go on and on. But when they were out, they did a really good job.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Yeah, [<a href=/Drew-Doughty rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Drew-Doughty>Drew Doughty</a>] wouldâ€™ve been. Thereâ€™s no doubt that we missed him last year. He meant so much to our team, and his surgery, he worked really hard, and his body was healing. Would he have played in that next round? Itâ€™s hypothetical, we donâ€™t know. But he wouldâ€™ve tried everything he possibly could to get there, but we donâ€™t have to worry about it now.</p></blockquote><a href=#drew-doughty><h3 id=drew-doughty><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span><a href=/Drew-Doughty rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Drew-Doughty>Drew Doughty</a></h3></a><blockquote><p>I was very impressed with how we played very impressed and with how Quickie played. Yeah, it was a close series, but Quickie made it a close series, I thought. We did play well and we had a chance to win the series, thereâ€™s no doubt about it. But, very proud of the guys â€“ we had a lot of guys whoâ€™ve never played a playoff game. We had some big players out of the lineup, and I thought the guys stepped up really well. So, it was a great stepping stone for our team and we need to carry over into the season.</p></blockquote><a href=#todd-woodcroft><h3 id=todd-woodcroft><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Todd Woodcroft</h3></a><blockquote><p>Our players, most of whom played in that playoff series, will have a keen understanding if the shoe was on the other foot in terms of how youâ€™d want to react the next time you came up here. What I go into is the fact that this team is in front of us in the standings, that we have a great opportunity to improve our play at home, and that starts against a very game Los Angeles Kings team tonight.</p></blockquote><a href=#jaret-anderson-dolan><h3 id=jaret-anderson-dolan><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span><a href=/Jaret-Anderson-Dolan rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Jaret-Anderson-Dolan>Jaret Anderson-Dolan</a></h3></a><blockquote><p>Something Iâ€™ll remember for a long time, for sure. Hopefully itâ€™s not the last time. Hopefully I have a bunch more of those because that was a blast having family and friends there, but I would have liked to get a win.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I think for not playing in a while, the first little bit was just getting the rhythm back. A couple plays I could have been better on for sure, but for the most part, solid and looking to build on that, for sure.</p></blockquote></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/2022-2023-Regular-Season/ data-ctx="Returning to Edmonton as a player, not observer, Doughty praises team growth and credits Quick - JAD looks to maintain rhythm after Calgary homecoming" data-src=/2022-2023-Regular-Season class=internal-link>2022-2023 Regular Season</a></li><li><a href=/Drew-Doughty/ data-ctx="Returning to Edmonton as a player, not observer, Doughty praises team growth and credits Quick - JAD looks to maintain rhythm after Calgary homecoming" data-src=/Drew-Doughty class=internal-link>Drew Doughty</a></li><li><a href=/Jaret-Anderson-Dolan/ data-ctx="Returning to Edmonton as a player, not observer, Doughty praises team growth and credits Quick - JAD looks to maintain rhythm after Calgary homecoming" data-src=/Jaret-Anderson-Dolan class=internal-link>Jaret Anderson-Dolan</a></li><li><a href=/Kevin-Fiala/ data-ctx="Returning to Edmonton as a player, not observer, Doughty praises team growth and credits Quick - JAD looks to maintain rhythm after Calgary homecoming" data-src=/Kevin-Fiala class=internal-link>Kevin Fiala</a></li><li><a href=/Returning-to-Edmonton-as-a-player-not-observer-Doughty-praises-team-growth-and-credits-Quick-JAD-looks-to-maintain-rhythm-after-Calgary-homecoming/ data-ctx="Returning to Edmonton as a player, not observer, Doughty praises team growth and credits Quick - JAD looks to maintain rhythm after Calgary homecoming" data-src=/Returning-to-Edmonton-as-a-player-not-observer-Doughty-praises-team-growth-and-credits-Quick-JAD-looks-to-maintain-rhythm-after-Calgary-homecoming class=internal-link>Returning to Edmonton as a player, not observer, Doughty praises team growth and credits Quick - JAD looks to maintain rhythm after Calgary homecoming</a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://lakings-graph.com/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by John White using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, Â© 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://lakings-graph.com/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/vJourneyman>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/vJourneyman>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
