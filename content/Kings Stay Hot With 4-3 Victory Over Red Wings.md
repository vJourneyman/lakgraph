## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> It was a good homestand, I thought our road trip set us up for that. We played a really good game in St. Louis, got spanked in Dallas, learned a lesson, and probably deserved better in Chicago so it gave us some momentum coming home. You look at the goals against on the homestand. Even tonight it wasn't an even strength (goal) against, it was two powerplays and a 6-on-5. Powerplays last game and a shutout, so we haven't given up much 5-on-5 which we're happy about. A few things to clean up, but good teams play with detail all the time, over and over and over again they don't let it slip and that's what we're pushing to be.

> I wouldn't say it's getting easier, because it's a hard task. \[[Sean Durzi]]'s getting more accustomed to it. He's learning, or maybe he's learned already, when those pressure points come and how to react to them. If you haven't played over there on your offside that's all brand new. Some of the situations he's been caught in, you don't see him caught in those spots anymore. Repetition, practice, and playing, he's doing a really good job.
