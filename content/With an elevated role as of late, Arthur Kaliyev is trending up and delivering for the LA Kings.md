## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> I think \[[[Arthur Kaliyev]]] has really taken it up a notch these last six, seven games. He was playing well, but he really looks hard and heavy, puck protection, his physicality, it looks like he’s playing with so much authority right now. It’s fun to watch him play.

> I think if we look at his time totals the last four or five games, they’ve all gone up and so has his level of play, so it coincides with each other. If I’m [[Arthur Kaliyev]], I get to play on the top power-play unit, or 1B, playing in a pretty good spot there and I like the way my game is going. If I’m Arthur, I’m saying all of those things and he’s getting rewarded now with more minutes.

> He’s coming out of those piles with a lot more pucks and I think that’s why I say he’s playing with a little more of an authoritative presence. His shot always was there, this is what I do. Now, his body and his legs are complementing it and he’s becoming a more complete player. We’re happy for him.

> He’s become a man, he’s getting stronger, he’s more fit. You haven’t heard us talk a lot about his engine this year, it’s because it’s stronger too, a lot of good things.

### [[Arthur Kaliyev]]
> Yeah, there have been a lot of chances that I’ve had. Over the last three games, I’ve actually missed a ton, so I have to start burying those I think and then the chances on the power play are a bonus. I just have to bury at 5-on-5, keep going the same way, just put home those chances.

> I think I’ve been way better over the last few weeks and I’ve got to keep going there. Hopefully I can just keep getting better and better. I didn’t start the way I wanted to in that area, but I think it’s coming along and I’ve done way better as of late.

> I’m trying to prepare for it and hopefully I can do a better job of it this year than I did last year. I’m just trying to be myself and play the same way. I know what it is now, I’ve been around for a year, so I feel a bit more confident. I want to play the way I was and not put as much pressure on myself.
