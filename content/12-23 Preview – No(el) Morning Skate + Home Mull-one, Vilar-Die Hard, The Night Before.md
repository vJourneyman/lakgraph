## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> \[[[Jonathan Quick]]] has been through a lot in his career and he’s as competitive as they come. He wants that net and he’ll \[eventually] get that net and when he does, he’ll play very well…..and I expect our group to play very well in front of him too, they owe him that.
