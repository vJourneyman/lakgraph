## Notes and Quotes
### [[Marco Sturm]]
> It was better. I think the effort was there. I think the commitment was there. I think \[the players] tried to do the right thing. These guys work. They come to work every day. We just didn’t connect as well as we used to, but I think that’s normal. It’s been a hard ten days or a couple of weeks, so I’m glad we came up with the big two points tonight.

> I’m saying it every time, but special teams are big. Yesterday we lost not just because of the PK goal against but because we had the opportunity to score a couple times on the power play and didn’t. Today was different and we won, so sometimes special teams makes the difference.

> It started with \[[[Quinton Byfield]]], especially. I think that his best game was yesterday. He had the puck a lot, he was breaking out everywhere, and it all went through him. That’s how it should be. Today, he was okay, but I think yesterday was really good and you can tell he’s slowly getting his feet and body going. Same with \[[Alex Turcotte]]. There’s a few guys who just have to be patient and we still have to work with them. All of them still have a lot left in the tank and we’re here to try and develop and help them, to get them up \[with the Kings] as soon as possible.

> Especially for \[[[Alex Turcotte]]], being away for such a long time and now playing as a wing, sometimes its not fair to the player. We expect a lot from him and he hasn’t really played \[as a winger] in a long time. That’s why, even when he makes a mistake, its okay. You have to help him to, because I’m the guy who’s going to put him in that situation and I will be the guy who is going to help him out. He will be the guy who is going to get better each week. I think, with \[[[Lias Andersson]]] gone for a bit, we needed somebody to play with Byfield. We have a lot of centermen, so we made that switch and we’ll see how long it goes. I think \[that line] had a pretty good start. I think there’s no reason to change that.

### [[Pheonix Copley]]
> It definitely feels good. We were desperate and hungry for a win, and you could see that we came out pretty hard, so it feels nice to get back to our winning ways. I think that and it can be a learning lesson for us going through that as a team. Obviously its very frustrating to be losing and not winning, so I think going forward we can take that as a lesson and use that hunger to not let that ever happen again.

> For me, I want \[my mentality] to be the same. There can be times when that’s more challenging than others. Obviously, when you’re losing, it’s a little bit more challenging to play the way I want to play. But it’s hockey and it’s sports, there’s wins and losses, so you just have to roll with the punches, learn from it, and get better.

> You just have to move on from it. That kind of stuff happens and if we’re going to win games and if we’re going to be a good team, we have to push through adversity. We did that tonight and that’s why we came out on top. We could have easily folded. That was obviously a tough break for us, but the guys came back and scored right away. I think that helped everybody and got everybody going again.
