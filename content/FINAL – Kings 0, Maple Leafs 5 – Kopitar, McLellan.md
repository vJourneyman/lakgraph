## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> This was obviously both. I think you’ve got to have one to have the other and if the mental part isn’t there, there’s no way the physical part is going to be there. It was both. I thought we were light and slow in the first period, we didn’t win any races and when we did even come close to winning any of them we were real light in our sticks and light in our body position, and just kept on going all night.

> No, I’m actually quite disappointed because we haven’t used words like light or slow in a long, long time with our team. Yeah, we’ve had some bad nights where we’ve made mistakes, but that was uncharacteristic of ours and it’s a little bit concerning.

> In the first period, because if – and this might not make any sense – but if we’re not doing it in the first period, what are the chances of us finding it in the second? Sometimes you can come out of it, but I think the three goals in a minute and a half or whatever it was sums up the night. We were done after the first two, so it’s disappointing.

> Yes it is. It’s disappointing. Yes it is.
