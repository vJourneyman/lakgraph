## Notes and Quotes
### [[Viktor Arvidsson]]
> I think we played fast and we executed. They did too, but I think we made better decisions with the puck and we were more effective.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> I thought it was a complete game by everybody. We didn't have to rely on just one or two people, starting with the goaltender. I thought he played really well and gave us some confidence.

> They were strong and it wasn't at the cost of anything going the other way. I thought they managed their shift length really well tonight. 'Vintage' is probably a pretty good way of putting it.

> \[[[Alex Iafallo]]]'s just steady. He does a lot of little things. You could see early in the first period, he was ready to go. I'm sure his legs and his hands probably don't feel as good as he'd like them to, naturally, but his mind was sharp. He went to the right spots and had a real good sense of timing.

### [[Pheonix Copley]]
> Felt good. It was nice. Guys played well in front of me so that's always nice and, yeah, it's great to be in the win column.

> It was kind of a broken play and it ended up that \[Giroux] had an open net and I just tried to push over and get whatever I could in front of it and, fortunately, it hit the blade of my skate. Sometimes you get lucky, I guess.
