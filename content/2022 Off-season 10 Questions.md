		1. Fits almost all of those things
		2. Very little cap space

		1. JT Miller
		2. Quinn Hughes
		3. Elias Petterson
	7. Anaheim
		1. Lots of cap space

	5. Last year the Kings weren't quality over quantity, an artifact of the COVID year
	6. Blockbuster deals usually require trading a first rounder, but questioning the need for such
	7. 50 context limit and 90 player reserve list
		1. Didn't count players in junior
		2. If every RFA and UFA signed, 49 contracts 
3. Re-signing Adrian Kempe
	1. Arbitration eligible
	2. How many years of UFA are you buying?
4. Re-signing Mikey Anderson
	1. Walker and Roy both signed second contracts for around $3M/year
	2. The Athletic said he's the 8th best shorten defensemen in the league
5. Left defense
	1. Anderson/Bjornfot Young guys
	2. Edler/Maata veterans who might not have been anticipated to return, but now might
	3. Bjornfot is only 20/21, had great tools, already 100 NHL games played, fell out of the lineup. Great with Roy, not great with Durzi. Might need a steady defenseman. He had a better season then just how it ended.
6. Right defense
	1. Drew doughty is a lock. Roy is probable.
	2. Walker off of injury
	3. Durzi and Spence showed they can play. 
	4. Faber, Grans, Clarke
	5. Spence and Grans can play on Ontario
	6. Durzi is no longer eager exempt. Clarke can only play in junior or the NHL 
	7. What does the organization think is most important? Continuity, development, experience? Defense, offense?
	8. Didn't even mention Strand, Stetcher, Moverare, Wolanin
7. RFA forwards other than Kempe
	1. JAD, Grundstrom, Lemieux, Villardi, Lias Andersson 
	2. Grundstrom has a playoff game and did well. Maybe the most improved. Consistent when I'm the lineup. Impactful bottom six. Dustin Brown light.
	3. JAD & Villardi: both probably qualified, figure out where they slot on training camp. 
	4. LW1 and LW3 are up for grabs. And probably 4 total wing spots
8. UFA veterans
	1. AA, Frk, Tynan
