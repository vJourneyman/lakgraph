## Summary
> Forum Report is very excited to bring you this feature, which will break simple possession statistics into a more nuanced understanding of who’s pushing the play towards the attacking net and how they’re doing it. It’s storytelling in chart form with some bullet points – a data-driven enhancement to what you saw the previous night. All statistics and commentary reflect the team’s five-on-five play.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> They were firm, they were hard, they won a lot of puck battles. \[[[Arthur Kaliyev]]] was physical and stripped a lot of pucks, fed those players. \[[[Rasmus Kupari]]] won faceoffs. [[Jaret Anderson-Dolan|JAD]] obviously worked his butt off and scored.

> And neglect are the ones we’ll go after the players with. You’re going to hold them way more \[accountable]. A mistake’s a mistake, and they’re going to be made. And the player himself, you’ve got to understand where he’s at. Is he really struggling? Because if he makes that mistake, you might have to soften it up because you put him further away. There are some players you don’t even need to say anything.
