# About

The LA Kings News and Knowledge Graph is an experiment in curating the existing news about the National Hockey League's Los Angeles Kings franchise. 


## The Goal
At several times in my fandom, I've wanted to compare something that someone wrote about a player in the past and what was being written in the present. Where were those pre-draft quotes about the player who was hitting 500 games? But that all seems to evaporate. What I needed was an index to pull insightful stuff out of the source that hosted it. For example, I love listening to [[Mark Yannetti]] discuss amateur player scouting, evaluation, and drafting, which he's done several times in several different podcasts, videos, and written media. But I don't know where it all is and the significant things he said in them to pull out patterns. So this is my attempt to review and index significant media coverage of the Kings.

## The Vision
I'm sure that different people might find this site interesting for different reasons. For me, I'd love to be able to read coverage on players over time, especially prospects breaking into the league. If someone has a breakout year, it would be fun to read back through the coverage to see if anything emerges during that breakout; It might be interesting to read the prospect profiles from before and immediately post-draft or during development camps and pre-seasons.

## The Details So Far
- I review coverage manualy and cross-indexed by events, player, staff, and writer. This is all a work in progress so not all of that cross-referencing is complete. I've emphasized cross-referencing articles by player over writer, site, or staff member (There's a list of all [[Quinton Byfield]] article mentions, but not [[Todd McLellan]] mentions or a master list of articles from [[The Athletic]]).
- I pull out quotes or headers, but not entire articles. I'm not quite sure where to draw the line on that, but I'm not comfortable pulling out anything besides quotes and main talking points right now. The goal is to have enough information to understand if the article is relevant enough to read at some time in the future.
- A lot of the sources have identical quotes. I'm not sure what to do about that. The goal of this experiment isn't to replace reading the articles, but to serve as a link to them.
- I've paid to subscribe to sites to read their content if it seems promising. Right now, the list is:
	- [[The Athletic]]
	- [[The Hockey Tactics Newsletter]]
	- ESPN (well, for the streaming games, not the news coverage)
	- [[The Forum Report]]
	
	- I hope others can decide from my indexing whether or not these sources are worth subscribing to.
- I'm not including AP game summaries from whomever licenses them, for example, the [[LA Times]]. I'm interested in the original coverage or analysis they might provide.


Do you think there's a source of Kings news that I'm not adding to the record? 

What do you think about the experiment in general? I'll think about the best way to leave feedback.

## The Tools
- I store coverage notes and cross-reference them in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).
- I publish the notes using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).
