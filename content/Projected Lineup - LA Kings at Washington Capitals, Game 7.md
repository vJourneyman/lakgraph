## Summary
> Riding a three-game road winning streak heading into Thursday night, the Kings had plenty of confidence. However, a 6-1 loss to the Penguins likely only brought one tiny bright spot — defenseman Brandt Clarke’s first NHL point, an assist on Carl Grundstrom’s goal.
> Refreshed and reloaded after a day off in Washington, coach Todd McLellan is looking for a rebound game out of his group before they all head back to Los Angeles late this evening.
