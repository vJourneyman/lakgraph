## Summary
> Forum Report is very excited to bring you this feature, which will break simple possession statistics into a more nuanced understanding of who’s pushing the play towards the attacking net and how they’re doing it. It’s storytelling in chart form with some bullet points – a data-driven enhancement to what you saw the previous night. All statistics and commentary reflect the team’s five-on-five play.
