## Summary
> Inconsistency once again in Los Angeles. The LA Kings cannot put together a string of consistent performances and Sunday night's loss was another dip in their roller-coaster season.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Our passing was atrocious (in the first period). But our thought process into where we were sending the pucks and passing was even worse. So, you combine those two things together, we were making it fairly easy on them. They have some structure and a system that you can't be stubborn and play through. You have to play behind it a little bit and I thought we did that in the second and third.

> \[[Jim Hiller]]'s been doing some really good things with our power play. And the trees starting to bear some fruit, if you well, and guys have to continue. Unless there's a real strong work ethic on it, it doesn't matter who you bring in or what he's trying to do with the group. Our power plays had some good work ethic lately and it's getting rewarded.

> I would say the same thing for \[[[Lias Andersson]]] as I did for JAD ([[Jaret Anderson-Dolan]]). It's a tough job to do, but as you grow older in your career and you settle in, that could be your role and you have to be ready to go. Lias did a good job tonight. We have expectations for Lias, we've seen him enough. Our expectations for him will never be greater than the ones he has for himself. He's a good man that way and he expects a lot from himself so we won't ever over-expect for him. He drives himself.
