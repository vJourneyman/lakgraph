## Summary
> Forum Report is very excited to bring you this feature, which will break simple possession statistics into a more nuanced understanding of who’s pushing the play towards the attacking net and how they’re doing it. It’s storytelling in chart form with some bullet points – a data-driven enhancement to what you saw the previous night. All statistics and commentary reflect the team’s five-on-five play.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> \[[[Arthur Kaliyev]]] probably could’ve had three goals himself if he beared down. But they checked well, they played with some pace, and I thought \[[[Viktor Arvidsson]]] and \[[[Blake Lizotte]]] were on pucks a lot, and that opened up ice for Arvy. Some good defensive plays, the faceoff circle was good. They’ll play certain spots on the special teams, and they contributed there. I thought it was a better night tonight with them than it was night number one.
