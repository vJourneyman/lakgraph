## Summary
> After tinkering with his lines at the end of Monday’s game in Calgary — including moving Carl Grundstrom up to the first line with Anze Kopitar, and dropping Gabe Vilardi down to play with Phil Danault — coach Tood McLellan went back to his familiar setup for Wednesday’s victory in Edmonton. We’re expecting that same configuration tonight in Vancouver.
