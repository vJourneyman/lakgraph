## Notes and Quotes
### [[Anze Kopitar]]
> We’ve got to figure it out. We can lean on last year all we want, but at the end of the day, we’ve got to bring it every night.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> I think the three goals in a minute and a half or whatever it was sums up the night. We were done after the first two, so it’s disappointing.
