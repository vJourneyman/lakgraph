## Notes and Quotes
### [[Alex Edler]]
> They came out flying. They usually do that here. They were faster than us in the first.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Put it this way: the start wasn’t what we wanted, and if you don’t have your legs, you better have your brains, and we didn’t have either, and that makes it a real tough night. So, that’s going to lead to penalties.

> Well, we decided to go 11 and seven. We wanted to play that, and we wanted to get Clarkie into a game.

### [[Anze Kopitar]]
> There’s no need for the frustration level to be high right now. We played a good game last \[Monday], we didn’t get it done \[Tuesday]. But obviously there’s another game on Thursday, and 2-1 on the trip will be a pretty good trip, so we’re going to rest tomorrow and get back at it on Thursday.

### Colin Miller
> When \[[[Adrian Kempe]]] came to us in the American League, I think it was his first time coming over and playing in North America, and you could tell early on that he was going to be a stud.
