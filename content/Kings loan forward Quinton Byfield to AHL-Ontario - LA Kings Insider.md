## Summary
> The LA Kings have loaned forward Quinton Byfield to the AHL’s Ontario Reign here on today’s off day. Byfield earned the 3C role coming out of training camp and took some noticeable strides early in the season, as he formed an effective third line with Alex Iafallo on the left and Gabe Vilardi on the right. Byfield appeared in each of the team’s first eight games this season, tallying three assists, but has not played since October 25 due to illness, which caused him to miss each of the team’s last six games.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> He’s back \[on the ice], which is a great sign. He lost a lot of weight and he’s going to need to get strong again. He’s going to need some time to recover.

> I’ve always said I don’t think anybody should lose their spot to injury or illness, it’s outside of their control. Usually you lose your spot in the lineup based on indifferent play, so we’ll see when eveybody gets back. There’s no decision that has to be made right now on Quinton or \[[[Rasmus Kupari|Ras]]] or anybody else in our lineup, because \[Byfield] is not yet ready to play.

> I’d like to do that with Iafallo and anybody that’s out, Sammy Fagemo in the minors, Turcotte, we want to get them all up to speed, because they’re all important players and Q is no different than anybody else. He needs energy, he needs strength and he’s got to feel good about himself. We’ll see where it goes this week.
