## Summary
> GOOD MORNING, WORLD JUNIORS! Iâ€™m breaking my rule of no caps to express how thrilled I am to finally be in Moncton after 56 hours of fighting, scraping and elbowing my way between continental vertices unconnected by a dedicated artery. Sadly, there is no direct flight between Burbank and New Brunswick.
