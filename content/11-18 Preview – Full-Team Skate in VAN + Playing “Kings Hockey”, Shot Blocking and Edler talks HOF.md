## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> I think it’s a really good thing that they are talking that way after certain types of games because that’s how we’re built and that’s how we want to play, or need to play. Sometimes it gets away on you, but that consistency we’ve been looking for all year, if they’re buying it and believing in it, it’s certainly a lot more powerful than when it comes from us.

> The game is full of mistakes, it’s full of ups and downs, the energy level changes. We try and get the best out of each other, coching staff, players and staff on a nightly basis, sometimes it works and some nights it doesnt. Over time, 82 games, if you do it the proper way, you’re built properly and you have enough talent, you should get some results out of it, but if you live and die on 60-minute production, night after night, you’ll be going crazy.

> It’s a big part of of the game today. You can’t take time and space away all the time and players are going to get looks and that’s when you have to get in front of that puck. We did a tremendous job early in the game and I think that led to our identity in Edmonton. We were committed, we weren’t shoddy as we were in Calgary. It can be contagious and it should be.

### [[Sean Durzi]]
> We know what our game is and I that’s really important for a group to know their identity and to find it early and build on it. It’s really important, so to have an idea and to know what kind of hockey we want to play and to build on that now is important, and I think that’s something that we’re going to do.

> I think you saw the sacrifice in the first period and throughout the game, guys blocked shots, guys stepped in front of slapshots, looking at it from 20 feet away. For hockey players, it looks easy, but that’s pretty hard shot coming in and they hurt but to see the sacrifice and see the guys do that, everyone from first line to fourth line and all six D. Everyone was talking, getting in front of shots, sticking up for each other all that is special. You can see that, when you have that with a team, guys tend to play for each other and it’s important.

### [[Trevor Moore]]
> That had to be the most blocked shots for us of the year, if not the last couple of years. I think that we had a really good team effort that way and helped Cal out a lot and he made some great saves for us too. It was great as a team.

### [[Viktor Arvidsson]]
> Yeah I feel like that’s always there in our game, but it was extra \[against Edmonton]. It started with \[[[Jaret Anderson-Dolan]]] blocking two on his first shift, then it was Kopi and everyone laid out and helped out.

### [[Alex Edler]]
> What an honor. Well deserved, I can’t think of two better guys both on and off the ice. \[The Sedins] helped me a ton in my career and they took me under their wings from day one. Just to be around them, on a day-to-day basis and see what they do, see how professional they are, how much they competed, how they worked, I think it helped everyone that played with them.

> Yeah, same thing there, I don’t know if I’ve seen a harder competitor when \[Roberto Luongo] was on the ice, whether it was practice or games, you know, he was a true professional. Being around those people and having those players as teammates, it rubbed off on everyone. Also very well deserved.
