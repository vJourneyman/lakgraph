## Summary
> The Kings went to the Midwest and the East Coast for five games in eight days, four of which came against teams that qualified for the playoffs a season ago. The Kings finished that trip with a 3-2-0 record and McLellan’s quote was reflective of how the trip went.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> We’ve got to break it down into the whole and look at it as 3-2, but then obviously the last two, the Pittsburgh one we weren’t real pleased and this game wasn’t a disaster, although we gave up four the in the third to lose. We’re still not where we need to be, quite frankly and I think that’s evident in the amount of goals that we’ve given up.
