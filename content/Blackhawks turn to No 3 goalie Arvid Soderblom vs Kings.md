## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> If you don’t have your legs, you better have your brains, and we didn’t have either. That makes it a real tough night and that’s going to lead to penalties. The penalty kill did not get it done. We had it on our tape numerous times to clear and it didn’t come out.

### [[Anze Kopitar]]
> There’s no need for the frustration level to be high right now. We played a good game last night. We didn’t get it done tonight. There’s another game on Thursday (and) 2-1 on the trip would be a pretty good trip, so we’re going to rest tomorrow and get back at it on Thursday.
