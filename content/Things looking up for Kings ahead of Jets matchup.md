## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> This is a brand new slate for us. I’d like to think we’re moving in the right direction.

> Even the game in Washington, other than the comeback, we’re starting to do some things characteristic of last year. We’ll still find our way and evolve as we go.

>\[[[Brandt Clarke]]] seems to find his way out on the ice so, obviously, we believe in him or we wouldn’t be doing that. The organization has to sit down and make decisions on what’s right for him, for us, for the future, for now. All Brandt has to do is worry about practice (Wednesday).
