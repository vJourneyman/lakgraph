## Summary
> The LA Kings…………practiced!
> Normally not a huge headline, but for the Kings here in the first month or so of the season, it’s been few and far between that the Kings have actually hit the ice for a full-team practice, considering the league’s heaviest slate of games in the early goings.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> It’s been nine days since we actually got the whole group out there and had a grinding, heavy hard, direct, barking practice. Results, whatever they would have been against the Panthers, we were having this type of practice today. We just happened to have those and we’ve got a couple practices more this week that are going to be really important.

> Yeah we did \[like how things went], but when we didn’t, we let them hear about it. Do it again and do it right. You’re not going to be perfect, but we’d like to be thinking about perfection and trying to do it right.

> We have to take advantage of it, which is why today it was a pretty stiff, straightforward practice. There wasn’t a lot of fooling around or fun and games because we don’t have a lot of time to get better. As the week lays out, we’ll have that. It’s always harder to practice on the road, it just is. You’re at practice facilities, you don’t have the same type of equipment, all that type of stuff and the mindset is a little bit different, it’s almost a maintenance day.

### [[Phillip Danault]]
> Our last practice was what, over a week ago? We definitely feel good and obviously after a win too. We want to fix a couple of things, we know we haven’t been bad but we got to be better with system details, things like that. So, it obviously felt good to practice.

> We want to play fast, we want to work on that and that was the main subject for our practice today. I think if we play fast, it would be a great addition for our team.

### [[Sean Durzi]]
> Guys battle against each other a little bit and work on a few things, sharpen things up and quite honestly just getting some good work in was good for us. You always feel better when you get your work during practice, there are always things that we can clean up as a team. Working hard, executing and having fun, it only helps us build, get closer as a team and it helps our game on the ice. It’s good to get back at it.

> It’s nice to play games and get into a rhythm, but with the travel and all that it takes a little bit of a toll. We’ve done a decent job on the road so far, there are obviously things you want to get better at but getting into that groove is good. For myself, it’s my second season now, so it’s something I’m a little more used to, which is nice. Recovery, taking care of your body, the older guys here appreciate it more than anyone and I learn from them.
