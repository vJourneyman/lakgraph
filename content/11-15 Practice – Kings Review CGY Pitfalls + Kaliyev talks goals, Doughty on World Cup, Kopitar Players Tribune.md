## Summary
> A practice on the road. Novel. The Kings were on the ice in Edmonton this afternoon with the focus on regrouping in advance of tomorrow’s showdown with the Oilers. Today’s practice wasn’t necessarily a long one, considering the short travel last night within the province of Alberta, but it served its purpose with the Kings focusing in on a few specific details they wanted to go over, discuss and address on the ice after yesterday’s game against the Flames.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> When we watched the Calgary game again, I think the will and the effort wanted to be there, but mentally some really poor decisions and some poor execution. We just talked about that, we showed them a few clips that we thought we were doing well in the five games prior that we didn’t do well against Calgary and that we’ll need tomorrow night against a really good team.

> I think \[[[Arthur Kaliyev]]] had that shooting mentality from juniors, obviously he was a prolific scorer there, but it’s different. A lot of these shots that he’s taking now, he might have 30 goals in junior, but the teams that are defending and the goaltenders that play in this league are pretty darn good, so you can’t just have an I’m going to shoot it and score mentality, you had to be ready to score. You might have to shoot a little quicker, you might have to find a spot that’s a little more fine than what you’re used to. Very rarely does somebody enter the league and score 40 right away, they work up in increments. We’re seeing that in Arty’s game, and I think that’s part of it. He’s getting ready to score rather than just to shoot.

### [[Arthur Kaliyev]]
> Yeah, I’ve just been shooting off of what they’re doing, I think we have a perfect combination with all the players we have on \[that unit]. It makes it easier to one-time the puck on that side and I play there most of the time. It’s been working pretty well and hopefully we keep that up.

> I just saw a rebound that popped up and was thinking that maybe the goalies wouldn’t go back into his position. I figured I might as well just fire it at the net and see what happens and it went in.

### [[Drew Doughty]]
> It’s unfortunate for \[Connor McDavid], he obviously deserves to be on that team and win and it would be an absolute honor to play with him, I can’t even imagine how easy it would be. I hope that day does come, but it won’t be for awhile, so right now I’m just going to keep trying to shut him down.

### [[Anze Kopitar]]
> You get spoiled in a hurry with this, because there are people that are flying halfway across the world just to come here. I’ve been here for 16 years and you kind of take everything for granted with how special this city is.
