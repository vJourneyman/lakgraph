## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> I guess with Cal, there's no secret we have to get him going. He has to play like he can play. He's an NHL goaltender. He's an outstanding young man that's played extremely well at this level. We're trying, just like we would with forwards and defensemen, to get him to where he can be. He has to be better.

> When I look at the start we had, I thought we played the way we wanted to play. We played fast. We were aggressive, forced them into situations where they had to turn the puck over. Things were going pretty well for us. Even after the first goal, I thought we responded well. By the time it got to three, unfortunately, it wasn't the same way anymore.

### [[Anze Kopitar]]
> Being down 3-0 after the first period certainly doesn't help. I didn't think our play was that bad. Just a couple tough breaks. We're down 3-0 and then you're obviously playing catch up. You're trying to make something happen. It didn't happen tonight.
