## Summary
> Training camp practices are in the books!
> As Todd McLellan said last night and reinforced here this morning, the evaluation process has not ended, especially not with an exhibition contest still on the schedule for tomorrow. The next time the team takes the ice here at Toyota Sports Performance Center, however, it will be for a regular-season practice.

## Notes
> I would say that the group is quite close, but will the game tomorrow change anybody’s opinion, it sure could. From a business perspective, managing the cap, waivers and transactions that have to happen, these have to get planned out a little bit earlier than tomorrow, so there’s a plan. I know Rob and his staff have a plan in place and it can adjust after tomorrow, based on performance, injury, need, waiver wire from another team, whatever it might be, but there is a plan in place. -- [[Todd McLellan]]

> We’ll have to evaluate him, like we do after every skate, but I think there’s a good chance he’ll be in tomorrow. If he’s fresh, capable and feeling good, we’re going to play him. -- [[Todd McLellan]] on [[Viktor Arvidsson]]

> Yeah, we’ll see, I’m taking it day-by-day and just trying to work on my game, tying to be comfortable out there. It’s coming and we’ll see when I get the call. I’ll talk with the medical staff and see where we’re at. -- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]

> I think it’s timing, just being in the right positions. That takes a little bit of time to come back, but I’ve played for awhile now, so it shouldn’t be a problem. -- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]

> We won’t get to everything, but we’re hoping that the stuff we don’t get to instinctively comes to them. They’re going to need some reminders, but we, like most teams, are going to be a work in progress for a good month to nail down exactly how you want to play. Special teams are still a big part of wins and losses. Game management is really hard to practice and that’s a big part of wins and losses, so they have to manage themselves in those situations. -- [[Todd McLellan]]

> We’re not trying to shed a lot of habits, we’re actually trying to bring them back, which is kind of unique, that’s what we’re waiting for. I think we did some things better down the stretch last year than we’re doing right now and we’re trying to retrieve those habits and those situational things that we did better, but I’m sure most teams are probably saying that. A lot goes away in the summer and you got to re-live it again and polish it up. -- [[Todd McLellan]]
