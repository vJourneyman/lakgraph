## Summary
> For the second time this season, the Kings defeated the Wild on Tuesday night â€” only this version came wrapped in a completely different blanket. Last month, it came in the form of a 7-6 barn burner in Minnesota. For the rematch, things came down to Gabe Vilardi and Jonathan Quick; a pair of fairly common themes over the past six weeks.
