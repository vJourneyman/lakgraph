## Summary
> Drew Doughty has long been generous with his time in Edmonton and often carries on with longtime Oilers broadcasters, reporters and columnists in his visits to Rogers Place. And that was no different on Tuesday, when the ultracompetitive defenseman spoke about the difficulty of missing last year’s playoff series after undergoing season-ending wrist surgery one month prior.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Drew Doughty]]
> I was just coming here for leadership, keeping the room loose. I think I did a good job with that.

> and then \[[[Sean Walker]] and I] usually went for lunch, got a little nap in, played FIFA with the guys that got scratched and then came to the game.

> We were actually worried because we would play when the boys were napping, and we would be in my room playing and yelling when we scored on each other. I was worried I was waking the guys up from their naps, actually. It was actually a lot of fun coming here and not playing. It was a lot of fun.

> even when I had the cast on, I was able to take off this part of the cast and still play.
> It was an adjustment, but it was actually kind of nice because I don’t use this hand for anything in my daily life, like even texting. God gave this one some love for once.

> do whatever it takes to play in the playoffs if we make it \[past Edmonton], because I haven’t played in the playoffs in a long time, willing to risk further injury. Maybe not the right choice.
> Now it’s a good thing that we didn’t go through because I probably would’ve forced myself back in, but I was willing to do whatever it took to play.

> I wouldn’t have been in game shape, no, but I can play with no game shape.

> I was very impressed with how we played, very impressed with how Quickie played. Yeah, it was a close series, but Quickie made it a close series, I thought. We did play well and we had a chance to win the series, there’s no doubt about it. Very proud of the guys. We had a lot of guys who had never played in a playoff game. We had some big players out of the lineup, and I thought the guys stepped up really well, so it was a great stepping stone for our team and we need to cover it over into this season.

> Well, yeah, I didn’t want \[Tyler Toffoli] to score. Never want to see an ex-teammate score on our team, never. I mean, he’s a goal scorer, a great player. I’m not surprised that happened at all. But yeah, every time I was out there against him, I was trying to play him well, play him hard. He’s one of my buddies obviously, but I just treat it as playing against another guy.

> I didn’t say anything to \[Tyler Toffoli] about the goal. Went for dinner with him the night before, him and \[Trevor Lewis]. It was good to catch up, but when we got out there, it was just playing against each other.
