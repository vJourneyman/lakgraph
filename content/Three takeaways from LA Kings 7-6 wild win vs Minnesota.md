## Notes and Quotes
1) Wild first period
2) [[Kevin Fiala]] back in Minnesota
3) [[Cal Petersen]]/Penalty Kill need work

### [[Kevin Fiala]]
> It was really nice being here, and I appreciate all the support from the fans. It was a great moment for me, and I enjoyed it.

> It was nice to score the first goal and the group circling around me, it felt great being on this team.

### [[Adrian Kempe]]
> That was a crazy game, maybe not the usual Kings hockey that we see. We ended up on the right side at the end. Offensively, we took a step in the right direction. Defensively, too many penalties tonight, something we have to work on.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> I think if you told us that we were going to score seven goals, I would have been jumping for joy. It’s the giving up six that isn’t the ideal recipe. That’s a really hard game to explain.
