## Summary
> The LA Kings open up a cross-border, back-to-back set Friday night at Rogers Arena (7:00 pm PT / Bally Sports West / LA Kings Audio Network), where a water-treading Vancouver Canucks team is fighting for stability after an 0-5-2 start anchored them to the depths of the Western Conference. But are they really fighting? Is there scratching and clawing and desperation in that fight? Let’s find out.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Sean Durzi]]
> I’ll be honest with you, I was thinking about that one since we went out in seven at the end of last season. It was a pretty important one, I’d say. Maybe one I had circled on the calendar a little bit.

### [[Phillip Danault]]
> It felt really good, you know? So we want to reproduce that feeling, no matter who we’re playing. It’s still a division team right now, and we want to keep building our game. It was so much fun that everyone was blocking shots, respecting the system, playing tight defensively, so I don’t see how we wouldn’t repeat that, you know?

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Over time, 82 games, if you do it the proper way and you’re built properly and you have enough talent you should be able to get some results out of it. But if you live and die based on 60-minute production night after night, you’re going to be probably needing some help. You’ll be going crazy. That’s the way it is.

> Edmonton, \[[[Drew Doughty]]] was tremendous in that game. I thought it was one of the best of the year. He really wanted to play in that playoff series. Didn’t get the opportunity. You don’t get to make up for lost time, but he performed very well in that game \[on Wednesday]. Not just that game. We know what he means to our team. He’s played a lot of hockey over the years and he’s still playing 26 minutes a night, managing it very well.

### [[Alex Edler]]
> They were the two go-to guys here for so many years. They took that responsibility and they did it the right way. They worked hard, they came in with a good attitude every day and they just showed great leadership for the team. Not only that, but all the things they did in the community, for the city and organization.

> I don’t know if I’ve seen a harder competitor. When \[Roberto Luongo] was on the ice, whether it was practice or games, \[he was] a true professional.
