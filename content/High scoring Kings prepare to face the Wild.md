## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> \[[[Quinton Byfield]]] lost a lot of weight and he’s going to need to get strong again. He’s going to need some time to recover

> We’re trying to rein it in a little bit more and be better defensively, but at the same time, in the same breath, we’re scoring more. We’ll see. We’re our own team right now, we’re figuring it out.

> Are we going to be a high-event team every night? We’d better keep scoring five. If we’re going to be a high-event team and not put four or five up on the board, then we’ve got to fix some things.

> Fours are popping up all over the place, so the team that can get to four and really check well has a chance at the championship, I believe, right now, if it stays this way.
