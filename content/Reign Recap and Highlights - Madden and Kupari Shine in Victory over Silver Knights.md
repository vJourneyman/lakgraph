## Summary
> Game 3 of the 2022-23 AHL season saw the Ontario Reign skate to their second win, defeating the Henderson Silver Knights 5-3 on Tuesday night. After a dry night offensively in their previous effort, coach Marco Sturnâ€™s squad found their scoring touch, as Tyler Madden and Rasmus Kupari led the way, with each totaling a goal and an assist. Special teams were effective when needed; the powerplay converted once on three occasions and the penalty killers went 4-for-4 when shorthanded.
