## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> We went from shoddy, I think was the word I used in Calgary, to committed. It looked different, it felt different, we played way closer to our identity.

### [[Cal Petersen]]
> We should just show that game every single training camp, because thatâ€™s basically Kings hockey in a nutshell.
