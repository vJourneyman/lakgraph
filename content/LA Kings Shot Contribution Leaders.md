## Summary
> I’d like to get an idea of who is driving the offense for the LA Kings. For this, we’ll look at a couple of different things. First is primary points, meaning who is scoring the goals and picking up primary assists (i.e., the pass that led directly to the goal). Additionally, we’ll look at shot contributions. This consists of individual shot attempts and shot assists (the pass leading directly to a shot attempt).
