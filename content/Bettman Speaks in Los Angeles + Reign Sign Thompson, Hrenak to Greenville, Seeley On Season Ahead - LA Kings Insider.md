## Summary
> NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman was among those in attendance on Opening Night in Los Angeles.
> Bettman addressed a wide array of issues, though few truly pertained to the Kings


## Notes and Quotes
> The cap basically only goes up by a million per year until the escrow is paid off, and people tend to forget that the escrow got very large during COVID, because even when the revenues were down, we paid in accordance with the contracts. Weâ€™re getting close. Another couple of years max and we should have it repaid and then it will go back up. -- [[Gary Bettman]]
