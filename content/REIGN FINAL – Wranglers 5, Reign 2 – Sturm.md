## Notes and Quotes
### [[Marco Sturm]]
> I thought we played one of our better games tonight. Yes, we didn’t add to finish and the result we wanted, but I saw a lot of good things, especially the first 40 minutes. One of the best periods we ever played so that was a good sign. Now we just got to work on the rest but there was a lot of good things we did today.

> We stuck to our plan we talked about this morning. What’s important and what works and what not and that we have to play as a team as well. And you could see it, I think we right from the start we had really good energy, everyone was involved, everyone was on top of his game right away and that’s why we were up 2-0. It shows you what we can do with this team. We’re just maybe not there yet, but I saw a lot of good things today and hopefully we can build on that.

> That line (\[[[Lias Andersson]]], \[[[T.J. Tynan]]], \[[[Samuel Fagemo]]]), I think they had a day off yesterday and they responded today big time. They scored two big goals and also had a lot of chances. That’s what we need. We need our best players to be the best players and that’s what they did today.

> \[Brett Sutter]’s an even better person. I think he had a great night, he had a great game, he scored, I think everything went his way and I think we were happy enough to be around him for lots of years and I’ve known him since he was a little kid because I had his dad as a coach and nothing really changed. He’s still the same humble guy and likeable guy and I’m very happy for him and he should be very proud too, 1000 games, that’s a lot of games and that shows you the character and everything around the person he is.
