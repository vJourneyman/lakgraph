## Summary
> The LA Kings have given up an unacceptable 39 goals against so far this season (which is good for 4.3 goals against per game). While some of the blame falls on goaltending, we are also not seeing the usual lockdown defense we have been accustomed to in the past.


## Players

- [[Tobias Bjornfot]]
- [[Jacob Moverare]]

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> I would think the experiment of run and gun that we’re trying to play, like how much more evidence do we need that it doesn’t work?… Maybe we will become the run-and-gun team. I don’t like our chances, but if that’s how we want to play and that’s what we’re going to keep trying, we’re probably going to keep getting the same results.
