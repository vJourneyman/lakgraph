## Summary
> The LA Kings showed off a different setup with their top powerplay unit in Saturday’s 4-3 win over the Detroit Red Wings. It didn’t take long for it to pay off, scoring on their first chance. Overall, the power play went 2-3 with the man advantage, with Sean Durzi adding a tally in the second period.
> Here, we’ll take a look at the new setup of the first unit and why I think there’s a lot of potential for success.
> Empasis on the [[Bumper]] position in the power play.
