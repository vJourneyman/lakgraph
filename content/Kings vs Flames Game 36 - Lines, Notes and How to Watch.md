## Summary
> The Los Angeles Kings (18-12-5) have a chance to extend their win streak to four games tonight against the Calgary Flames (15-12-6). This would tie their current season-high win streak and go a long way in putting their inconsistent label behind them.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> I'd like to think that. I'd like to think we're a little more aware of the track meet style game, from a defensive style, I'd like to think we are.

> We were running really hot (on the power play) for a while. And that rate is unsustainable, you go hot and cold for a little bit, but that rate we were scoring at isn't sustainable or it would have been an NHL all-time record. Since that hot run, we've played quite well in those situations and created momentum for our group. They're not always gonna be Picassos but I thought the other night against Anaheim, in particular, once we got on the power play we got a little more momentum out of it and gained some steam. It provided us what with we needed.
