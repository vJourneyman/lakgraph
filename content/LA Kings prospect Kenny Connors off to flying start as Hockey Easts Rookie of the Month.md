## Notes and Quotes
### [[Kenny Connors]]
> Coming into UMass, I wanted to do the best I could to earn the trust of the coaches and work as hard as I could. My focus was to learn the guys and get to know them as best as possible and build chemistry on the ice.

> I think beating Denver was a big step forward for the team and myself and the team’s confidence. After those wins, I felt a lot more comfortable on the ice. I think my linemates and I have done a really good job so far as we’ve built chemistry down the stretch. I think the coaches have done a great job putting me in places they think I can succeed.

> I strive to be a 200-foot player who can play in all three zones and be trusted at all times in the game. A lot like the guys the Kings have like Anze Kopitar and Philip Danault, they’re two of the best two-way centers in the NHL. That is the game I try and play. someone who is responsible defensively but can also produce offensively and score goals consistently. Having guys like Kopitar and Danault makes it easy to watch and try to model my game after.

> I spent the day with my family and just stayed in the moment. It was a really special moment hearing my name called and I was really lucky to have my family around me. Once I heard my name called it was great to connect with staff and begin my relationships with the members of the Kings organization.

> What stuck out to me the most was being able to be around guys like Quinton Byfield, Arthur Kaliyev and Jordan Spence who have all played games in the NHL. Having them skate with us and work out with us was really cool. We got a chance to see what they’re doing to play at the NHL level and could measure up against them to see what we can work on.

> I’m not a big goal setter, I don’t want to set expectations and be happy after a loss or mad after I win if I don’t succeed on goals I set. I just want to help take the team as far as we can and be playing meaningful hockey when there’s just a few teams left at the end of the year. I want the team and I to be playing those important games at the end of the season. If we do that then I think we can call the season a success.
