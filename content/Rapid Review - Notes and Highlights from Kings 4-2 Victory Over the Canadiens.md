## Summary
> On Reverse Retro night in Montreal, there was definitely a bit of a throwback feel to things. Over on the Kings side that is. In net, things are starting to have a Rick Knickle vibe to it. Back in 1993, with Kelly Hrudey having a very difficult time stopping the puck, coach Barry Melrose helped orchestrate the signing and call-up of a 33-year-old career minor league goalie from IHL San Diego. He came in and won four of this first six starts for the Kings.
