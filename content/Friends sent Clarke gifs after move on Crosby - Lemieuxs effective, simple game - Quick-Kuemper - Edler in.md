## Notes and Quotes
### [[Brandt Clarke]]
> In the back of my mind, I was like, ‘holy \[schnykies], holy \[schnykies], that worked!

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> I don’t think they come into a game and say, ‘you know what? We’re gonna play cute.’ The uglier it is, the better.

> Well, you use the word ‘preacher.’ When you go to church, the preacher’s important, but the people sitting in the pews are the ones that really make the church up, and you either believe it or you don’t. So, [[Drew Doughty|Drew]] can continue to do that, I can continue to do that, everybody else in there can have an opinion, but the churchgoers have to buy into it. 
> \[...] And I don’t think that’s gone away, but I think it has to show up a little bit more.

> \[[[Gabe Vilardi]]] can play high in the D-zone. We’d obviously prefer our centers down low. It doesn’t always happen that way. But I think he’s got more in his tank when it’s time to go the other way or hold people off and protect pucks than he did when he had to play down low. When you’re in point coverage, the distance to the offensive zone is cut down by a lot of feet. He doesn’t have to skate as much.

### [[Brendan Lemieux]]
> \[...] it’s only a matter of time when you’re playing the way we’re playing.

> We know where each other go on the ice. We’re not looking to do anything cute, and we’re playing the game the way a fourth line is supposed to play it, which is simple and make it hard on the other team. Nobody likes to play against the other team when they’re spending the all night in their end. And a great way of spending a night in the other team’s end is just by putting it in there.

> When we have an off-night, I think it’s just a result of trying to put it in and not being able to.

> I mean, no. The game’s only getting more skilled.
> I play a very simple style of hockey, and I try to just be myself and not make things too cute or try to make to many pretty plays, and just really beat people with simplicity. So, when I get to play with guys like, let’s say Grunny, who can play a simple game but also have the offensive ability and the skill to make other plays, it works into my favor. I’ve always been able to score goals and make plays, but I try to do it off simple plays rather than shooting the puck from the outside or trying to go top-shelf when I can just throw it on net and create a rebound or offensive zone time. I think our line’s identity and how our coaching staff has wanted us to play is to play that same simple style of game over and over and over and repeat that process.
> But no, I’m a simple hockey player that tries to do that every night.
