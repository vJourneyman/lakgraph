## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> For as much as you want to always want to keep your team together and not separate it, I thought there were some individuals who let us down tonight rather than the group as a whole. Sometimes you have to play the game a certain way. It may not be the way you like. It may not be cute. But that's the way you have to play. And we had some that couldn't accept that or didn't want to, and I believe that cost us.
