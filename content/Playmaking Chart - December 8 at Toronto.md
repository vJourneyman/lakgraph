## Summary
> Forum Report is very excited to bring you this feature, which will break simple possession statistics into a more nuanced understanding of who’s pushing the play towards the attacking net and how they’re doing it. It’s storytelling in chart form with some bullet points – a data-driven enhancement to what you saw the previous night. All statistics and commentary reflect the team’s five-on-five play.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Anze Kopitar]]
>  Even the first period, it was zero-zero, but in large part thanks to Quickie. Quite frankly, all the credit goes to him. We weren’t good enough. 

### [[Todd McLellan]]
>  If we’re not doing it in the first period, what are the chances of us doing it in the second?

> I thought we were light and slow in the first period. We couldn’t win any races, and then when we did even come close to winning any of them, we were real light on our sticks and light in body position, and it just kept on going all night. … I’m actually quite disappointed, because we haven’t used words like ‘light’ or ‘slow’ in a long, long time with our team. Yeah, we’ve had some bad nights where we made mistakes, but that was uncharacteristic of ours, and it’s a little bit concerning.
