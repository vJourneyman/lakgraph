## Summary
> \[...] per NHL rules, once he plays his 10th game this season, the Kings will have “burned” the first year of his Entry Level Contract. And for a team up against the cap, you want to use those low-cost deals sparingly because they give you some roster flexibility in other places.
> That leaves three more games before Blake and the team have to make their final decision. However, from what we’re hearing, it’s trending toward Clarke staying up with the club.
