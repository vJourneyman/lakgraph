## Summary
> Tonight's game against the Carolina Hurricanes will be a litmus test for the Los Angeles Kings. The Kings responded well to their 9-8 loss on Tuesday, and the sending down of Cal Petersen with a win on Thursday night. But, beating a rebuilding team who's missing their leading goal scorer is an expectation. Beating the Hurricanes, considered by most to be a cup challenger, will prove a point.
