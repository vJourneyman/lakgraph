> Q: Well what are some of the things that, pre
-season that you try to do it's obviously
uh not the same Personnel but what are
some of the things you're trying to do
and evaluate here
> A: I mean uh you know
you know who uh uh a game like this some
guys never even played a game yet
um you know you want to try to get your
legs going and try to try to do the
stuff we've worked on all week and uh
and and try to yeah the best play you
can be you know there's a I think that
there's a lot of guys
um who could show me and uh and uh the
coaching staff what they can do what
they can bring for the team and uh and
uh yeah that's what's nice and
everything's all about 

> Q: opportunities for
a lot of different players who might not
be on the power play all the time to get
more than one opportunity out there
tonight what did you see from the power
play and what did you like what did you
not like
> A: well um I think we got scored on twice
on our power play and we got two or
three goals against on the BK so so that
has to be
that's that you know that has to be uh
yeah
fixed and uh you know but a lot of
different guys in a lot of different
positions today so
um but again I think there is some areas
today we we have to work on it I think
there's some guys in uh in this Locker
who will be here who have to be better
too there is no
you know season starts in a week so you
know there's a short turnaround and uh
yeah I think the guys
been going gard really
for all week long they deserve to have a
day off tomorrow and then regroup and
try to be better on Monday

> Q: some of those things that you said need
to be fixed you know you have a
basically a week until uh opening night
are those things that need to be fixed
are they are they quick fixes are they
things that take time 
> A: yeah there's a few
things I think it's in our control and
uh
and I think uh the mistakes we made
especially the first 40 45 minutes it
was
everything on on our tape and you know
so we gotta keep things simple first I
think everyone has to know also their
role and their team and uh you know you
don't have to do anything special you
just gotta
gotta play hard you got to play for the
team and be a good teammate and uh and
uh yeah win some hockey games 

> Q: there's a
lot of leaders in the room and you know
tonight there's a couple of times where
you know there's things that get a
little bit out of hand but you guys have
[[Cameron Gaunce]] [[Jacob Doty]] I mean what's it
like to kind of have those guys that
have been around and know how to handle
themselves 
> A: yeah I mean
we don't worry about that I know we're
we have a lot of toughness on our team
but again I'm not looking at I'm looking
more to I want to play hockey
um yes this is a big part of our our
team too and our game but end of the day
um you know I just didn't like the way
we played
um in general I think we had a good
start the first 10 minutes and after
that uh San Diego was just better than
us and and also I still I still think
there's
we still had enough good players in our
lineup and but again
it was a good lesson for all of us and
uh and now we just have to make sure
it's not gonna happen again 

> Q: you
mentioned a day off tomorrow what does
the the week look like as far as getting
ready for an opening game on on Friday
night 
> A: yeah no so I will see the day of
tomorrow we're gonna go come back
um
I think a few guys will will go down
after you know I think we're gonna have
a few guys from the Kings as well so the
team definitely will look different on
Monday
but again we only have I think three
practices next week until game one so we
just gotta make sure
we focus and be doing the right things in
those three days and be the best we can
in game one 
> we look forward to talking
to you then thanks
