## Notes and Quotes
> It was really nice being here, and I appreciate all the support from the fans. It was a great moment for me, and I enjoyed it.
> 
> I felt pretty good and obviously you know a little more motivated playing against my old team but it was good. It was a good first step in our direction and my myself as well and now we just have to build. -- [[Kevin Fiala]]

> Fuckin’ hope we never have to win like that again, but give the guys a lot of credit. They battled back every time \[Minnesota] put us on our heels and it’s not very often the last couple years that we’ve been able to trade goals when we’ve needed them, and this was a night we needed to find some goals, and we found them. A lot of credit goes to the guys. That’s obviously not the way I think we want to be winning these games, but hey … sometimes throughout the season some games are going to call for that. -- [[Cal Petersen]]

> There wasn’t a lot of volume both ways. The shots weren’t 50 to 49 or anything like that, it just seemed to be going in the net, didn’t matter what happened. Whether it bounced or went straight in, it was an odd night for both teams in their zones. I thought both teams did a real good job of penalty killing, yet gave up power-play goals. For a lot of years in the league, this one’s tough to explain. -- [[Todd McLellan]]
