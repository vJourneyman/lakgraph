## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> He feels confident, he looks confident and he makes us feel confident.

> \[[[Pheonix Copley]]]’s very relaxed in the net, it doesn’t look like he’s panicking at any point, he’s just making saves and he’s getting up and doing it all over again. It’s probably a good observation, I think that makes us feel comfortable.

> When \[[[Pheonix Copley]]]’s in the net, he looks confident and calm, which can calm things down for all of us. He’s made some really big saves, he’s made some simple, easy saves and obviously in the shootout he’s had success too.

> \[[[Jonathan Quick]]] and \[[[Cal Petersen]]], they need help too, our team is playing better right now in front of Phoenix than we did in front of the other two. When it’s time for Quickie to go back in or Cal or whoever it might be, I certainly expect it and I’m sure the players expect that type of performance in front of them as well.

> \[[[Pheonix Copley]]] right now is playing outstanding and he’ll definitely play in one of the two for sure.

### [[Pheonix Copley]]
> Every time I get a chance, I just want to do the best I can with it, regardless of what’s going on around me. That’s my mindset and that’s what I’ll continue to do.

> I thought we’ve played great defensively. A lot of blocked shots, a lot of clears, when I’ve left rebounds they’ve taken care of them. They’ve been great in front of me.

### [[Viktor Arvidsson]]
> Stability. \[[[Pheonix Copley]]]’s saving important pucks and he’s been great for us. Coming up, he’s just playing his game, he’s calm and steady. Just what we need.

### [[Sean Durzi]]
> \[[[Pheonix Copley]]]’s really calm, he’s a true professional, he takes care of himself every single day, you see it. Those are the kind of guys you watch and learn from. He does his thing very quietly and I think the guys can build off of that.

### [[Trevor Moore]]
> \[[[Pheonix Copley]]]’s just solid, he looks confident in there. He’s making good reads. I don’t know a lot about goaltending but he’s stopping the puck, so he’s doing great.
