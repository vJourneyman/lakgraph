## Summary
> The LA Kings’ 4-3 loss to the Washington Capitals Saturday night at Capital One Arena will leave a bad taste in the team’s mouth, even though it closed out a successful 3-2-0 road trip. Unable to stem the momentum as well as they had earlier on the trip, Washington scored four times in 11 and a half minutes and whisked the team west, searching for solutions to shore up its leaky defense. Los Angeles has allowed fewer than four goals only once this season, the 4-3 shootout win at Nashville.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Good teams make you pay for those – I don’t even know I’d call them ‘mistakes,’ but ‘lucky bounces.

> When we left LA last Friday, if somebody would’ve told me we’d score 20 goals on this road trip, I’d be pretty darn excited about winning a lot of games. 
> I’m not sure that we were that good in the first 40, either. There were some chances, but they were fewer. It was a dead game.

> And we expected that from Durz. He’s a competitive young man that does a lot of things well on the ice, and he plays like every shift’s his last shift, so no complaints there.

### [[Sean Durzi]]
> Just saw the open space. It’s nice to come off that left side there and finish the play. But it would’ve been a bit nicer if we’d finished the game.
