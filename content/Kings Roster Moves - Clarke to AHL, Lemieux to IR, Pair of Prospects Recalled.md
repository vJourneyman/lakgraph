## Summary
> As we reported a few days ago, all signs were pointing to rookie Brandt Clarke being assigned to the AHL, and it’s now official. Although he isn’t eligible to play this entire season with the Ontario Reign — as his rights are held by the Barrie Colts (OHL) — there is a provision in the CHL/NHL Player Agreement that allows for a 19-year-old junior player to have a two-week conditioning assignment in the AHL once he’s missed five consecutive NHL games. Saturday night’s Kings-Red Wings game marked such an event for Clarke, so now he’s off to join the Reign.
