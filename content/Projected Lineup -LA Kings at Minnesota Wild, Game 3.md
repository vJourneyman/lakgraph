## Summary
> For Todd McLellan and his Kings squad, there’s no better time than the present to get things going.
> One problem — already winless in their first two games this season, LA arrives in Minnesota to face a hungry Wild team. They were pummeled 7-3 in their own season opener Thursday night by the New York Rangers.
