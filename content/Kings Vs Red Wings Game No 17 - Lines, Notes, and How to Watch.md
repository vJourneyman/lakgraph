## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> He (Petersen) doesn't have to play, but he has to play. He's played better when he's been back in the net. \[[[Jonathan Quick]]] had a really good run. You don't mess with a shutout, in my opinion, so maybe Cal would have been back in earlier but he wasn't. Tonight's his night so make it count.

> No, today was timing and getting him going again. It had nothing to do with what happened last year.

> Against Chicago our faceoffs, other than Kopi (Anze Kopitar) nobody won one. Jonathan Toews owned us and when he gets on the ice Toews or the opposition and wins a faceoff and you have to start continually from behind your net and get up ice it can be frustrating. Nobody bats a thousand, so you come up and it doesn't work the first time now you're even more frustrated.

> You almost have to play it like you're going to lose (the faceoff). If you're in the offensive zone and you aren't winning a lot of draws I don't know what you're thinking if you're setting up a faceoff play. What happens if, when this puck gets dropped it goes down to the goal line? Who's jumping up quickly, when you're winning faceoffs you're going 'hey let's do this or run that.' The mindset changes.
