## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> I think it’s 14 games in 26 days, and with eight on the road. It all evens out, but we have not had enough practice time. There are reasons why teams don’t practice. One is four mandatory days that the players have off, based on their CBA agreement, which they deserve, they need time off. Then, there’s the travel when we get home at three o’clock in the morning, it’s difficult to get that group up. We talked to some of them and some of them went home and still couldn’t sleep. You wake up, your sleep pattern is broken and you jumped in a car, it was cold the other night, everybody’s wide awake and you’re not getting to bed until 3:30. So. I’m trying to explain why we haven’t practiced a lot. Now, with that being said, the schedule is the schedule and we planned for that and try and get better as much as we can without this skates. We’re adding a few things to pre-game skates when we do skate.
