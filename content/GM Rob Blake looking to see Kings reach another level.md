## Notes and Quotes
- Pushing onward
  > Progress, again, continued progress. We made a big step getting back in the playoffs, now we’ve got to hold that level and keep going.
- Righting the special teams ship
  > It’s another year of adding a couple different younger players into that equation, and then the addition of Fiala gives you a different look on that. So you can see a little bit different movement on our power play than we’ve had in the past.
- Regression to the mean or raising the bar?
  > We saw glimpses of that. The more complete player has come out of \[[[Adrian Kempe]]] throughout the years.
- New kid on the block
  > It comes down to making sure that, when he does get in the lineup, he’s going to get the right amount of minutes to keep developing. His play through rookie camp and training camp put him to a level where we want to see him in the NHL.
- Touted prospects
  > Both times \[[[Quinton Byfield]]]’s come into camp ready to go and looked to us like he could earn that spot. He’ll get his chance there now.
- A crowded field
  > We understand we’re going to be in a battle to get in, just like we were last year.
