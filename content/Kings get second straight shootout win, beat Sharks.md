## Notes and Quotes
### [[Trevor Moore]]
> We were consistent, stuck with it the whole time and tried to play our game.
> We’ve played our fair share of the high-scoring games, trying to risk it on offense, and we learned that that’s not our game. We’ve got to check our way through games, if that ends up being one-goal games, we’ll take it.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> (The penalty kill) gave us a chance to stay in the game. It played a huge role in the chance to get to the shootout.

> It was a timely goal, it got us back on track, it evened up the game and it was from our fourth line. There’s a lot of real positives there.
