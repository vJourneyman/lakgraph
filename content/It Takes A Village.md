## Notes and Quotes
### [[Arthur Kaliyev]]
> I just went out for a skate and it was all good. Ever since then I played every day.

> Obviously I wanted to play hockey way more than school. I didn't like school, I hated school growing up.

> It was pretty funny. Growing up you'd never think you'd be playing against them one day, so that was pretty special. I thought 'wow, I grew up watching \[Patrick Kane] when I was a kid.' He was one of the best players and I would never expect to play against him in the future.

> Every year we go to \[the US Open] and it's really fun. I think it's one of my favorite tournaments outside of hockey.

> I don't think we ever thought we would be two high-level athletes, we were just going day-by-day, work hard and see where it takes us. I'm glad it worked out.
