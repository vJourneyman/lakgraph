## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> That’s taxing both mentally and physically. Character with the comeback.

> At the end of the night, \[[[Cal Petersen]]] had to make outstanding saves in overtime and he was excellent in the shootout, and he’s won two games for us. So, for as much as it’s been talked about that he’s got to find his game, he’s won twice, and that’s a real good thing.
