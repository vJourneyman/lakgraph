## Notes and Quotes
### [[Trevor Moore]]
> It was kind of funny, I didn't feel like I had my best game tonight. It was just one of those games where the puck finds you, or I guess I should say my linemates found me. Some good bounces out there.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> We're happy for him, he works his butt off night after night. Does those things I talked about earlier, those defensive things that are key to winning some nights and he found a way to put the puck in the night. He's been there all year for us offensively, it just hasn't gone in a lot for him.

> We went from shoddy, I think was the word I used in Calgary to committed. It looked different it felt different, played way closer to our identity, likely how we have to play to beat teams like this and a lot of teams in the league. So, proud of the group.
