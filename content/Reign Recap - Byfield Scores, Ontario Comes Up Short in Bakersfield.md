## Summary
> Two clubs heading in two different directions; thatâ€™s the current state of Los Angeles and Ontario hockey. About an hour before the Kings wrapped up their fourth straight win at home on Saturday night, the Reign dropped their third straight contest. With a 3-1 defeat in Bakersfield, coach Marco Sturm also saw his club lose their exclusive hold on first place in the Pacific Division. Both the Reign and Condors are now tied with 15 points in 11 games.
