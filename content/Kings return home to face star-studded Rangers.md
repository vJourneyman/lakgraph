## Summary
> The Kings have played the most games and the most away games of any team in the NHL, which has meant limited practice time and less-than-ideal rest

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Alex Edler]]
> Maybe, but that’s nothing we think about. Every single team in this league, they go through stretches with a lot of games. Being tired is never an excuse in this league.
> Whether it’s a back-to-back, or you’ve played a lot of games lately, you’ve got to come out and battle and execute your system. The good teams win, even if they play back-to-back or have a lot of games.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> When you have a player like that, that gives you every last ounce of everything he has, when he makes mistakes they’re much more livable than maybe the players that don’t quite get to that level. That’s why his teammates love him.
