## Notes and Quotes
### [[Marco Sturm]]
> The difference today is that we were not willing to do it for 60 minutes against a hard physical team. I think we had a really good start and then they took over and that was the game.

> I think it always seems like we play a little bit better with a lead but I think today it already started, it was still 0-0 and we already got away from our game and didn’t play the right way like we can and they did so that was the difference.

> When you play a team like that, I think you should have a shot mentality and we talked about it, we didn’t want to pass up any opportunities. We also talked about front of our net versus their net, and they were just hungrier than we were. We didn’t show that urgency like they did in front of our net and again, it paid off for them and not for us.

> We’re going to treat it like any other game preparation-wise. I think it is a big game for us. Obviously, we want to respond after this effort tonight. Also, it’s going to be the last game before Christmas and I think we all we all want to go into break and leave on a good note. We’re going to show some video tomorrow and try to fix a few things and show them what we have to do to win a hockey game and there might be some changes too for tomorrow, get some fresh legs again and and hopefully for a good game.
