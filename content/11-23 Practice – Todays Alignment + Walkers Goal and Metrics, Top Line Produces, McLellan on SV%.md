## Summary
> Just a quick one from today’s practice in El Segundo, as the Kings took to the ice earlier today in advance of Friday’s game against San Jose. The team is expected to practice tomorrow as well, but with the Thanksgiving holiday, we’ll see what that skate looks like. The team is expected to travel to San Jose following that skate later in the day.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> I thought that \[[[Anze Kopitar]]] and \[[[Adrian Kempe]]] had perhaps one of their better games lately and that’s probably due to the fact that \[[[Kevin Fiala]]] was there, helping them out. When I say that, I’m not demeaning [[Gabe Vilardi|Gabriel Vilardi]]’s play, he’s been really good. Just a different mix tonight, a different energy on that line and I thought that line gave us a game maybe that we hadn’t seen in a little bit.

> I would say there’s concern, yeah, but you also qualified it as I would, that when we mis-handle a puck on the blue line and give up a breakaway, that’s a pretty darn good save. When our goaltender loses a stick for whatever reason, someone breaks their stick and he’s got to dive across, it’s pretty damn good save. \[[[Cal Petersen]]] made a really good one on Panarin in the first period, so he’s making some real good saves, so has \[[[Jonathan Quick]], but we’ve got to as a group work on that save percentage. It’s not just the goaltenders, but as a group, we’ve got to bring that number up.
