## Notes and Quotes
1) Will the power play finally produce?
   > Jimmy brought a fresh set of eyes to our video from last year. It wasn’t tainted with opinion or frustration or joy. He shared a lot of thoughts and ideas with us, so we adopted some of those things. He’s been around some good players and good power plays. -- [[Todd McLellan]]
2) Who are these guys, really?
   > There’s always a place for progression, no place for regression. I don’t want to think that way, being scared of regression. I just want to get better as a team and as a player, and I’ll do whatever I can to win a Cup here. -- [[Phillip Danault]]
3) How much will Brandt Clarke play?
   > He doesn’t lack confidence and he doesn’t portray arrogance. That’s a pretty good quality to have. -- [[Todd McLellan]]
4) Blue chips or red flags?
   > I know I can make plays, so I just need to be more confident in myself and in my game. The rest will follow. -- [[Quinton Byfield]]
5) Can the Kings make the playoffs?
   > We’re on the old side of things right now, but me, Quickie and Drew, I think we still have quite a bit left. With the young guys developing as fast and as good as they did, I think it’s most definitely an opportunity to win again. -- [[Anze Kopitar]]
