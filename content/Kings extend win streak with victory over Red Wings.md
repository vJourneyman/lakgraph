## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Tonight, there wasn’t an even-strength goal. It was two power plays and a six-on-five. Power plays in the last game and a shutout (before that), so we haven’t given up much five-on-five.

> I thought we should have control of this third period better than we did today. We tried to be cute with it, we went to the penalty box, now it’s 4-2 and it gives them a chance to pull their goalie.

> Quick report after, they’ll look at \[[[Brendan Lemieux]]] in the morning. I think he’s probably going to be out for a while.

### [[Sean Durzi]]
> Dewey, on the left side there, made a really nice seam pass. Obviously it was a fortunate bounce for Kevin, but I’m sure he’ll take those.
