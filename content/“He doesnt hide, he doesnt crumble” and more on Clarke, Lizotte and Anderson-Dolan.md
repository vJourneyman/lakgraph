## Notes and Quotes
### [[Blake Lizotte]]
> You kind of have to tell yourself ‘the goals will come, the goals will come,’ but when you play well for three, four, five games in a row and they’re not coming yet it can get a little frustrating, so it was nice to put one in tonight.

> we knew it was going to be more of a blue-collar night

### [[Brandt Clarke]]
> I just knew I had a lot of time and space. Two D went over to the wall, and I knew if we could get the puck to me I’d be able to make a play. [[Arthur Kaliyev|Arty]] made a good delay on the wall to find me – I was calling pretty loud. … I didn’t know I was going to go back door, I just kind of made the read that was available. Vasilevskiy came out to take the angle away from me, so Blake was wide open to finish it off.

> I’m a bit more comfortable with reads with the puck, finding guys in the middle of the ice. I feel like I’m really good at transitioning the puck and I feel that’s been smoother, but also some of the top guys coming down on me and I’m holding them to the outside, not letting them get the middle.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> for him, for us, for the future, for now ... all that Brandt has to do is worry about practice tomorrow.

> Special teams, four-on-four, down by a goal, up by a goal, he seems to find his way out on the ice. So, we believe in him or obviously we wouldn’t be doing that. For us to move forward as an organization – today, tomorrow, two years from now – it has to come from underneath.

> [[Brandt Clarke]]'s' recovery from the mistake is what makes it impressive. He doesn’t hide, he doesn’t crumble.

> We had a talk with \[[[Jaret Anderson-Dolan]]] somewhere on the road about the opportunity’s going to come, and when it does, you have to make good. We felt pretty good about him being able to do that, and he’s done it in the past.

> We aggressively checked, and sometimes when you ask your team to check, they back off and they’re just standing and taking it all the time. We aggressively checked.
> We were all playing the same system for the most part instead of off on our own.
