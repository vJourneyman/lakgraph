## Notes and Quotes
### [[Kevin Weekes]]
> I love Cal’s skill set. But he’s partially a rhythm and feel goalie, and he needs to play some consecutive games to rediscover his feel.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Kopi’s line, and I’m not putting this all on Kevin by any means, has been out-chanced in the majority of the games they’ve played and we can’t keep going that route.

> It was a hockey decision more than anything. We’re going to get the nine, 10, 11, 12-game mark … we’ll share our opinion with the management team, but to this point \[[[Brandt Clarke]]]’s done a really good job of adapting to the NHL.

### [[Gabe Vilardi]]
> They drafted me to be a goal-scorer, a producer, to put up points. It’s what I’ve always wanted to do and it’s good that I’m doing it now. I’ve got to produce, that’s my job.
