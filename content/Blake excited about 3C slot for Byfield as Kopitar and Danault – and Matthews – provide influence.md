## Summary
> It’s about time to stop talking about the Iafallo-Byfield-Vilardi line’s performance Tuesday night, but there was one loose end to stitch, and that was the visibility of Quinton Byfield on the backcheck.


## Notes and Quotes
> I get to see that first hand every day, every game. There are a lot of guys. Even \[Auston] Matthews has developed that game, as well. I watch a lot of his games. Bergeron’s obviously won a bunch of Selkes.  -- [[Quinton Byfield]]

> Just where he sits in the lineup is what we’re excited about and allowing him to become the player he \[is]. He had a tough injury that set him back \[last season], but both times he’s come into camp ready to go, and looked to us like he could earn that spot, and he’ll get his chance there now.  -- [[Rob Blake]]

> “I think we’re all pretty big bodies, skate well. I think most of our forecheck, we got on ‘em early \[Tuesday], stripping pucks. Gabe, he’s hot right now, he has crazy skill, and I think \[we] have chemistry from playing in the AHL, as well. I think we fit in pretty well, and Al can play anywhere.  -- [[Quinton Byfield]]
