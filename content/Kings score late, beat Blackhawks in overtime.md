## Notes and Quotes
### [[Kevin Fiala]]
> It was a tight game from both teams. Both goaltenders played unbelievable. It was kind of a playoff game, and it’s nice that we won.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> We’re a little disjointed, the timing and rhythm are off. One’s going east, the other’s going west … we can fix it, we will.
> It probably wasn’t our best game, but sometimes you have to win that way, that’s part of evolving as a team.

> When \[[[Jonathan Quick]]] puts the gear on, that wakes everybody up. He made some real good saves. When we made mistakes, and we made some down the stretch, he had to make some big saves.

### [[Phillip Danault]]
> I think we’re respecting our system way more than we were at the beginning of the year. This is more Kings hockey right now. We’re playing good defensively, which creates some frustration in the other team and some chances on our side.
