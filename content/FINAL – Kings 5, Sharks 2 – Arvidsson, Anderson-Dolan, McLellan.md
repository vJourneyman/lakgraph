## Notes and Quotes
### [[Jaret Anderson-Dolan]]
> I’m not really sure, I think we were all just really working, doing the little things right and it was paying off. It turned into opportunities and we capitalized on a couple of them.

> Yeah, for sure. It’s kind of always been my focus. I think if you’re taking care of that, the rest will kind of take care of itself and it did tonight and it helped contribute to a win which is the most important thing.

> I mean, everyone does that, it’s different guy every night. So when it’s your turn, you just try to step up and get in the lane.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> It was a good recovery game. Obviously we weren’t pleased with the way things ended up against the Rangers. We had a couple of days to work on some things but it was a good road game. When that happens, usually all four lines are involved, all six defenseman, goaltending was solid. So team win.

> I couldn’t be happier for that group. That line played their best game of the season together. They were firm, they were hard, they won a lot of puck battles. [[Arthur Kaliyev|Arty Kaliyev]] was physical, he stripped a lot of pucks, fed those players. \[[[Rasmus Kupari]]] won faceoffs, [[Jaret Anderson-Dolan|JAD]] obviously worked his butt off and and scored. Many elements that are needed for success as a line, I think we saw that constantly from those three. They should all feel really good about themselves and should be prepared to do it again on Sunday.

> It’s big, they rely on their penalty kill. They’re very good at it and they believe in it. First one didn’t go quite as well. The second one though, we moved the puck around real good, hit the post and then scored, so that gives us a big mental boost because we haven’t had a lot of success against them and we were able to carry that through the night.

> It did, I thought we were doing a lot of good things in the second period, though. It’d be different if we gave that up and we’re just holding on. I thought we were doing good things, we had a chance to talk about it between periods but I sensed that was washed out of the system by the time we were walking back out. It’s a good sign.
