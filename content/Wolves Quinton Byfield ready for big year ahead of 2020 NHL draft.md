## Notes and Quotes
- Trains with [[Gary Roberts]]

### [[Cory Stillman]]
> He’s a good player that’s only going to get better. There’s a high ceiling for Quinton.
> He has the possibility to play, because of his size, because of his strength, in the NHL at 18.

> When he played midget, he had the puck, and if he didn’t have it, he just went and got it.
> Early in the year, when he didn’t have the puck, he wanted to chase it. In junior hockey, if you’re out of position, someone’s going to make a pass to your guy.
> Once he realized he should slow down, wait for it, and then attack and go get the puck, he got back into having it more.

> Right at the start, if we were down a goal and we pulled the goalie, he went out and played on the back end to run plays off as a 16-year-old.
> As the season went on, and we got into playoffs, if their goalie was pulled, I had enough confidence that he could play in an odd-man situation to win the hockey game also.

> As big as Quinton is, his engine, his motor, his legs, he’s on all the time. For six-foot-five, he skates very well.

### [[Quinton Byfield]]
> I haven’t been overseas. It would definitely be a special experience. It’s definitely an honour.
> When I was little, I always watched the world juniors. The under-17 and under-18 teams are stepping stones towards that. I would look up to all those guys.

> I started playing hockey when I was three or four. I really fell in love with the game playing house league hockey.
> When I was younger, on Saturday nights, I’d also go over to my opa and oma, my grandparents’ house, and watch the (Toronto) Maple Leafs play with my opa. That’s where I also fell in love with the game.

> \[Martin St. Louis] was the smallest guy, but he was still first on the puck and competing everywhere. That’s what I really loved about his game and I try to do that.

> It’s a lot about the food you eat as well. Everyone is training. It’s nutrition that really separates you. \[Gary Roberts]’s got me on a really good nutrition plan. I’m eating healthy and I think that’s translated to a lot of my success.

> I’ve been training my whole life for this. You work your whole life to hopefully one day get drafted to the NHL and make an NHL team. That’s every kid’s dream.
