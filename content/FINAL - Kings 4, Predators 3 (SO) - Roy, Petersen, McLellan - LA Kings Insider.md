## Notes and Quotes
### [[Cal Petersen]]
> It’s huge. We’re going to inevitably have situations like this again throughout the season and we can reach back and know that we’ve done it before. It’s part of our identity now and it was part of it last year, so now we have the confidence that we’re never out of it and we can find ways to come back and get points, win games.

> Yeah, granted, we blocked a ton of shots, you know, Mikey had a game-saving block there, it would have been over in overtime but I mean, it was just trying to build through each of these games with confidence. I haven’t felt like I’ve been getting the results that I wanted in these games, so that’s been challenging. Right now, it’s just building with each game, so this is huge personally for my confidence, but, it just feels good to get rewarded with the win.

> Yeah, I went back and started to squirt my water bottle when he got it alone in the slot because I know he always scores those. It was awesome. Another guy that it’s awesome to see get rewarded offensively, because he does so many things well defensively.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Very thrilled. Guys are excited and happy for each other, back-to-back early in the year, in this building, it doesn’t happen often but our guys had a good mindset going into third. I didn’t think we were bad throughout the night, a lot of momentum swings again because of penalties, both our team and their team, but I didn’t think being down two was a disaster. We did some good things, stuck with it and found a way to win a game.

> Certainly. It’s hard early in the year to play back-to-back. We’ve played five games already, we played every second night and if you think about exhibition season even, when we started to play all the veteran players, we played every second night for two and a half weeks. That’s taxing both mentally and physically. Character with the comeback.

> It’s not often that we’re talking about [[Matt Roy|Matt]] scoring two, to tie the game in the third period, but he has that ability. He’s got tremendous legs, he’s strong, he went to the net and he knows the score, he can gamble a little bit more and he did a real good job.Big night for him.

> At the end of the night, [[Cal Petersen|he]] had to make outstanding saves in overtime and he was excellent in the shootout and he’s won two games for us. So, for as much it’s been talked that he’s got to find his game, he’s won two twice and that’s a real good thing. I think he started to settle in. We talked about the disruption of his training camp and the fact that goalies take a little while to find their game, but all he’s done is won. He should be confident, he should feel good about himself and was a big part of the win.
