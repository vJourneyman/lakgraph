## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> We've got to care about more situations that are important coming back to our end. We have world-class players guys that we brought in to be shut-down players that missed assignments tonight. And it's not the bottom six, it's the top six right now. And that's great that we're scoring all those goals, but obviously, we're not getting enough points. I'm not sure that we value the checking part as much as we have in the past. It's just go and score. And it's disappointing. Another hard game to evaluate, I've been saying that pretty much the whole year. Great that we come back, great that we score goals, great that we stick with it, but the carelessness is killing us.
