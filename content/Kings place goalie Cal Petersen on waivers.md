## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> We have to look at each of the positions, starting with goal, and then D, and then the forwards, and we’ll break down the opportunities that we gave up. We gave up 30 shots on goal and nine goals, so where were they getting the grade-A chances?

### [[Phillip Danault]]
> Be stronger defensively, for one. When we make little mistakes, they cost us every single time. We can’t just keep doing it game after game, we have to learn from this. If we want to be a winning team and go far in the playoffs, we have to work on it right now.
