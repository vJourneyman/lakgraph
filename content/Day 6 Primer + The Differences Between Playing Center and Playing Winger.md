## Summary
> Following games on the road, on consecutive days, including travel back to Los Angeles last night after the win over Vegas, today’s skates are a bit delayed on start time. Group A is set to kick things off at 11:30 AM, rather than the usual 10:00 AM start time here in El Segundo.


## Notes and Quotes
> Definitely the defensive zone. Often times, you’re ending up low when you’re the center men, but with the way we play, if you’re the first guy back in the zone you end up being the low guy. It’s a little bit of both. I would say it’s just different thinking, a centerman is a little but more strategic, knowing where everyone is and as a winger, you’re kind of just marking your d-man and staying with him. It’s different but like I said, I’m feeling more and more comfortable with being on the wing, so I’m looking forward to seeing where I’ll be and definitely comfortable either way. -- [[Jaret Anderson-Dolan]]

> Wherever they want me. I played when I played center growing up, but these past two years with the Kings, I’ve been both, so I’m comfortable being a winger now. It’s actually a big difference, but I think it’s good to be able to play both positions. Center is more like stay down low, you win battles and winger is more like board work, blocking some shots from the point and it’s just details, but I think I got used to it pretty well, but you can always be better. -- [[Lias Andersson]]

> No \[preference] really, I can play both. I’m probably normally a center, but it doesn’t really matter, I can play as a wing too. Last year, I played some good games on the wing and wherever the coaches put me, I’ll be ready. In our system, whoever winds up being the first forwards down low takes that center spot for a while anyways. Yeah, there’s a hug difference if you’re the low forward or the winger, you kind of have more resposibility when you’re down low. Doesn’t really matter to me though, whether I’m center or wing, I can play both. -- [[Rasmus Kupari]]

> The biggest differences are in the d-zone. I feel like it’s more stops and starts versus standing still and reading the play. As a winger, it’s making sure you’ve got your defenseman, so there are subtle differences, but in the o-zone, it doesn’t really matter. I’ve got to continue to work on \[the defensive zone], you can always get better with your wall play and that’s important for me when playing as a winger, taking care of my own zone first. I feel like once I get in the o-zone I can create. -- [[Gabe Vilardi]]
