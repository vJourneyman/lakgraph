## Notes and Quotes
### [[Viktor Arvidsson]]
> I think me and Trevor had four points each the first time we played together. It just clicked right away.

> We’re competitive. All three of us. We want to get better every day. That’s a huge part. Even in practice, we try to make plays and make each other better.

> Yeah, I pushed hard. I was back in Sweden for about two months, working with a guy there. It was all going good. I came to L.A. like three weeks out (from) camp. I didn’t think I was going to be ready that early.
> We pushed it and see how it felt. It got better and better. Felt more comfortable. It was good.

> Obviously, Phil goes to the net a lot. Puts his stick down and is strong. A strong centerman that wins a lot of battles. Trevor’s quick and can beat his defender one-on-one. I think we complement each other really well. Just the dynamic. It’s working really good.
> But we talk about it, too. We talk about where we are on the ice and try to find each other.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> I think you have a real good team when everybody has a little bit of the team’s conscience in them. You can’t just rely on one or two guys. That line has an identity. It has a conscience. It plays a certain way.
> There’s other lines that don’t play similarly to them but they have their own conscience. They do their own thing. And if everybody takes a little piece of that main one and you own it, I think you have a chance to be a real good team.

> It took Phil and the coaches a time to maybe appreciate each other. So that took a little while. And then once he settled in, everything went good there. Arvy, we had a pretty good idea. It wasn’t tough. Mooresy was the individual that didn’t have a home.
> We were responsible for that. We moved him all over the place. He was playing left, right, center up and down the lineup. And the common theme was when Mooresy found a home, they created an identity and they’ve played towards it ever since. For as much as we’ve tinkered and moved players around, the constant is that line.

> It’s obviously yes. But I don’t know how you predict that. We didn’t predict that in Mooresy that, that would happen. We were actually looking at it a different way where he could move around and be the catalyst on any line. But he’s found a home and he’s comfortable in that position and we count on him. Maybe all of that has helped him.
> We predicted the other way. He proved to us it worked this way. That’s sometimes how it goes.

> \[[[Viktor Arvidsson]]]'s' drive and compete level is at the top. He wants to win. He’s emotional. And he completes that line a lot of times. There’s no such thing as a perfect player or a perfect line but he does a lot of things well for that group.
> I would imagine if you asked him, he’d say he’d like to finish a little bit more. I think he’s got one even-strength goal in the (22) games. But you miss a full summer of training and a full training camp and you try and play catch-up, sometimes your timing’s off or whatever it might be.
> It’s not through lack of effort or lack of opportunity chances. It’s there. He does a real good job of completing that line.

> Hopefully it doesn’t but it might. And that happens to every real good line. But right now, we like what it’s doing.

### [[Drew Doughty]]
> They definitely can have shifts that they are in their zone. It brings the team up. Gives us momentum. They definitely have a few of those shifts it seems like every single night. That’s what you want out of one of your top lines. They just need to keep doing it because they’re a big, big, big part to our team.
