## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> They’re a tough team to play against. They play at a high pace both with and without the puck, which makes them hard in all three zones. I thought we were prepared for it; it took us a little while to figure it out. When you fall behind, with that type of pressure, too, it’s tough to come back.

> I thought in the first period we were slow. What I mean by that is that we weren’t skating slow, but our decision to attack at the right time was slow. So as we released a shot or a pass there was always a stick on it … as the game wore on we got better in that area, but it was obviously too late.

### [[Samuel Fagemo]]
> I got the second breakaway of the game there, so I thought I’d be more patient and it was nice to see the puck go in. Of course it was a special feeling, but it sucks that the team lost.
