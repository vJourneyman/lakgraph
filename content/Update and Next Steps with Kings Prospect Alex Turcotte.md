## Summary
> Mayor’s Manor has learned via sources connected to the situation that Turcotte has now been given the green light to resume practicing with the Ontario Reign. He will soon join the club while wearing a non-contact jersey.




## Notes and Quotes
> He’s been dealing with the concussion injury that was sustained at the end of last year. He was on-track and doing well in the summer, but then had a setback \[and wasn’t able to participate at Development Camp]. So we’re dealing with that. He’s currently in a stage of his rehab where he’s skating on his own. Progressing from that point, we have some medical appointments next week for him. If everything goes as planned, and the way it’s directed, he’ll soon start working his way back into a non-contact spot at practice. Then, we’ll go from there. It’s a difficult situation for him and for us, but we have to put his health first. I know we all want to \[see him back playing], but he has to be healthy with himself and be in that situation before he can get back on the ice. -- [[Rob Blake]]
