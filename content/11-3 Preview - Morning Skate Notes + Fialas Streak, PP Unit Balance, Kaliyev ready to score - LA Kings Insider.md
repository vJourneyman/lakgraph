## Notes and Quotes
- Five For Fiala
### [[Kevin Fiala]]
> I think it’s just simplifying the game you know, it’s a part of success, I think, to just shoot some pucks, get to the front, get pucks down deep and grind them out. Just create some offense and I think the big thing is just simplifying our game a little bit.

> For sure, it’s nice to have all the lines going, it’s a team sport and I think especially in our wins so far, we’re playing good for 60 minutes as a team. I think we have to get back to that a little bit, but it helps us a lot to have that depth.
- Second (?) PP Unit
### [[Arthur Kaliyev]]
> I think we have a great combination of everything on that unit. We’re getting a lot of pucks on net, making great plays, keeping pucks alive. Overall, I think we’ve had everything, we’re doing a great job so hopefully we can keep it up.

### [[Phillip Danault]]
> I think we just keep it simple and we have a secret weapon. We have two good units and I think we’re keeping it simple, attack the net and we’re all on the same page. We’re working to get loose pucks, retrieving pucks and those little details can bring you a long way.

### [[Sean Durzi]]
> I mean, that’s good news, it’s good to find out that we got four in a row, but I think we just focus on what we can do well, do it to the best of our abilities and hopefully the puck goes in the net. Four games in a row means something’s working. We’re getting on the same page, we talk a lot talking about plays we want to make and where we want to be for each other and that’s really important.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Second or first, it depends on how you look at it. We haven’t looked at it any different, there are times when they start, there’s other times when Kopi’s unit starts, but they’re getting some things done. Not Picasso goals, but they’re goals. They move the puck well, they are relentless in getting it back and sometimes they simplify things and it works for them.

- To  Build Off that
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Retrieval points, when you’re on that back side and the puck comes to the net ona certain angle, odds are it’s coming out into your area \[[[Jim Hiller]]] talks about being ready to score not ready to shoot and there’s a big difference. I think we’re trying to get Arthur into that mindset of that comes to you get ready to score not just to shoot.

### [[Arthur Kaliyev]]
> I just try to read it, thinking about where the puck is going to be. They put it in a good spot and then it’s just reading about where the rebound went and where the puck is going to be. Then I try to just end up there, right place at the right time.
