## Summary
> American Thanksgiving is an important date on the NHL calendar, and not just for the turkey and The Athletic’s Black Friday sale. It’s a traditional point in the season — roughly one-quarter of the way in — when general managers have a good idea of what kind of teams they have and need to start making decisions on what to do about it.
> Kings
> Should be safe for playoffs
> Buyer at trade deadline
