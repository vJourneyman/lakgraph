## Notes and Quotes
- [[Martin Chromiak]]
  > Showcasing the fact that he is done with junior hockey, Chromiak tore up the OHL last season with 44 goals and 86 points. He won’t be an offensive catalyst at the next level, but he plays a very important role, the ultimate complimentary player. It takes a lot of skill and patience to ride shotgun with highly talented play drivers, but Chromiak has proven able to do so. He may play middle six minutes at the NHL level eventually, being in the right place at the right time for his star teammates and finishing the opportunities he gets. -- [[Tony Ferrari]]
- [[Alex Turcotte]]
  > Turcotte, when healthy, plays a tenacious, playmaking game built around a consistent effort level and a strong sense for leveraging timing and spacing to his advantage. -- [[Scott Wheeler]]
- [[Samuel Fagemo]]
  > I’m glad Fagemo got into some NHL action last year because his goal-scoring abilities deserved a shot. We know he can drive offense and has a great shot, and I’d expect he’ll get more NHL games this year. I’d like to see more improvements in the defensive zone, but Fagemo is someone to watch, for sure. -- [[Steven Ellis]]
- [[Jordan Spence]]
  > He got a taste of NHL action and did seem overwhelmed at times during his 24-game stint, but he was also nearly a point-per-game defender at the AHL level. Spence is a fleet-footed blueliner who moves the puck effectively with his passing ability or his mobility. He reads play at a very high level and should be able to contribute to the NHL roster in a bigger way this year should injuries arise, and he is forced into action, but another season dominating the AHL and rounding out his play in the defensive zone will go a long way in his development. -- [[Tony Ferrari]]
- [[Brandt Clarke]]
  > Clarke is a special talent who possesses the unique ability to both see plays that others don’t see and then execute them. He’s a highly gifted puck transporter and distributor who makes opposing pressure miss with subtle fakes and a unique knack for sliding laterally. -- [[Scott Wheeler]]
