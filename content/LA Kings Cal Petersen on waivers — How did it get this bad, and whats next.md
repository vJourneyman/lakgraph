## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> We have to look at each of the positions, starting with goal and then (defense) and then the forwards. And we’ll break down the opportunities that we gave up. We gave up 30 shots on goal and nine goals. So, where were they getting the grade-A chances? What was causing it? And trying to get our group to recognize those situations and play them better.

### [[Phillip Danault]]
> I felt like every mistake was going in our net every time. I guess it was that kind of game. … If we want to be a winning team, we got to work hard. Right now.
