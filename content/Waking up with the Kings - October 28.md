## Summary
> For the 0.8% of you not named Lias Andersson, Zach Dooley or Austin Stanovich, this is going to come off as incredibly niche-y. Apologies for the tangent and feel free to continue to the next paragraph. But as LAKI and The Forum Report evolved so slowly into soccer blogs that it was hard for the untrained eye to notice, last night’s game was the perfect example of a Football Manager game where you rested all your starters and were locked in a scoreless draw with Grimsby Town in the 84th minute of a Carabao Cup game in which your xGF is three goals better than theirs and the simulation quickly cuts to a highlight in which your team doesn’t have the ball. This esoterica has spawned memes, and for those of us who’ve spent months of our lives losing players to Paris St. Germain and combing Argentina for 16-year-old wunderkids, the Jets scoring the first goal after early Kings domination was all too familiar.
