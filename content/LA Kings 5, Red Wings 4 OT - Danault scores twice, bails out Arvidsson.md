## Notes and Quotes
### Five Takeaways
1) Quick responses
   > It’s just part of the game really. Obviously, when they tie it up, you want to go out there and score again, so we were able to do that, which is a great thing to have. -- [[Anze Kopitar]]
2) Game management still a problem
   > When we do that, we don’t find rhythm, we don’t use everybody, your mindset changes from a balanced game to one where you’re defending all the time, you’re having to sell out and block shots. There are a lot of things we need to fix, but if we could put our finger on one thing, that would be it. -- [[Todd McLellan]]
3) [[Phillip Danault]] bails out [[Viktor Arvidsson|Arvidsson]]
   > I thought we had a real good effort. We’re getting better, it’s starting to feel more like the way we should play. Still moments during the game, obviously the empty-netter, where we’re not quite there yet. -- [[Todd McLellan]]
4) Powerplay struggles
5) Housekeeping
