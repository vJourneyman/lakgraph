> We’ve had some excellent practices this week. I thought the guys have been really really good. I think we’re getting better every day and we’ve worked on a lot of things this week system wise, the way we want to play and it was a lot of information for the guys but they’re doing really good so I’m really pleased with the effort so far. -- [[Marco Sturm]]

> It’s been a really exciting week for me and I think everyone else in the locker room too. They all want to play. It’s been a long summer, it’s been a long camp including the Kings camp so I think everyone wants to play now. -- [[Marco Sturm]]

> I feel great. It’s a good feeling to be back after four months so I’m just enjoying every moment here and I can’t wait for the season to start. -- [[Martin Chromiak]]

> It was a great experience to play a preseason game,” said Chromiak.”I learned a lot from those older guys and NHL players so I just want to take a lot from them and from the coaches and do my best. -- [[Martin Chromiak]]
