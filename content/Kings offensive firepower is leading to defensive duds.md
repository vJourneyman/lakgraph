## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Thirty of us, because I’m including us as coaches, we’ve got to decide again, and I’ve been saying this for 10 games. Twelve percent of our schedule is gone and we still don’t know how we want to play. I would think the experiment of run-and-gun that we’re trying to play, like, how much more evidence do we need that it doesn’t work?

> Our only thought process on the power play is offense. There’s time when there’s risk involved in it, but we don’t play risk at all, we just assume everything’s going to work out fine and it comes back the other way, three times in two power plays

> If you don’t understand risk, you don’t play risk and you’re not responsible for risk, and that’s what happens.
