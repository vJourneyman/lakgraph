## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> When I look at the start we had, I thought we played the way we wanted to play. We played fast, we were aggressive, we forced them into situations where they had to turn the puck over and things were going pretty well for us. Even after the first goal, I thought we responded well, but by the time it got to three, unfortunately, it wasn’t the same way anymore and obviously we’d like to have a couple of those back in the first period. Even if we’re coming out of it at one, I think we’re in a much better state mentally, but with that being said, that’s the defensive side of it. I thought offensively, we had some opportunities with pucks on our tape cross-ice one timers, plays in and around the net where we weren’t particularly sharp offensively as well. We took it at both ends.

> Obviously the group was disappointed. We can’t go down three, it’s simple as that. We came in between periods talking about some of the things that we haven’t seen almost all year from our group and we’re down by three. So, we’re still figuring a lot of things out.

> I guess with [[Cal Petersen|Cal]], there’s no secret, we’ve got to get him going. He’s got to play like he can play. He’s an NHL goaltender, he’s an outstanding young man who has played extremely well at this level. We’re trying, just like we would with forwards and defenseman, to get him to where he can be, and he has to be better. I can’t stand here and BS you guys, it is what it is. There are others that have to be better as well in certain situations, but we had the momentum and we couldn’t close it.

> I thought that, now that [[Carl Grundstrom|Grunny]]’s back in the lineup, he’s been effective on all the lines. I thought [[Brendan Lemieux]] has really skated well over the last three or four games and [[Blake Lizotte|Lizzo]]’s intensity is showing up. They had a real good night. Not a lot of complaints about those three and if they can keep that going on, we’ve got one thing that we don’t have to worry about.
