## Summary
> From the 2020 NHL Draft, three of the first six players selected have skated in over 100 NHL games. Lucas Raymond sits at 95 and he’s now a regular in the Detroit Red Wings lineup, so he’ll cross the century mark here pretty quickly. There’s also one player, Jake Sanderson, who just turned pro this season after finishing up his college career at North Dakota.
> And then there’s [[Quinton Byfield]].
