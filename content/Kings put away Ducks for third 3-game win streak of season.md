## Notes and Quotes
### [[Sean Durzi]]
> Stringing a few together, that’s what good teams do. We’ve been trying to do this for a little while and to finally get some consistency there is nice. You can’t really take any nights off in this league, or else you’re not going to win.

### [[Pheonix Copley]]
> I just want to see how great I can be, I guess, and the way to find out is to work for opportunities.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> I wonder if the fact that \[[[Kevin Fiala]]] was sandwiched between a couple players allowed him to stay on his feet, but he is very strong and determined.

> The game’s changed a lot if that’s ‘unfriendly,’ holy boy. The San Jose, L.A. and Anaheim (rivalries) of 10 years ago, that was unfriendly.
