## Summary
> Just like they did in November, the Ontario Reign open up their December schedule with a matchup against the Colorado Eagles. This time the teams are in Ontario for the battle as opposed to Loveland, Colo. While the Reign won the month-opening contest in shutout fashion with a 2-0 win, the Eagles responded two nights later with a 7-3 decision. Colorado has been the hottest team in the AHL since that weekend, posting a 9-0-1 record in the 10 games since Ontario’s visit to take over first place in the Pacific Division standings.
