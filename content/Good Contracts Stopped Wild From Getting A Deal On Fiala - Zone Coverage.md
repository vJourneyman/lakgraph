## Summary
> Luszczyszyn gave Fiala’s 7-year, $55 million deal an A. He projects the contract to deliver $19 million in surplus value to the Kings over the life of the trade while giving him a 67% chance of out-performing the deal. It’s one of 36 contracts to receive an “A” grade or better. Even better, from here on out, Luszczyszyn projects only 13 of those deals will exceed Fiala’s surplus value.
> Simply put, this is one of the best contracts in the league.
