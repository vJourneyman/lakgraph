## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> They’re like a machine, they just play the same way game after game after game and they’re difficult to play against all three areas. So, it’s a really good challenge for our group tonight to play certain way to give ourselves a chance at success and we’ll see if we’re stubborn or if we’re willing to do it.

> I don’t think it changes their identity, I think it enhances their identity. They’re a volume shooting team and obviously I know Burnsy well, there’s not a puck that he’s ever seen that he doesn’t want to shoot, and he’s very good at it. Their ability to shoot, go get it back and pull you out of position is as good as anybody’s.

> Really effective. I think Arthur has really taken it up a notch the last six, seven games. He was playing well, but he really looks hard and heavy, puck protection, his physicality, it looks like he’s played with so much authority right now and it’s fun to watch him play. Gabe coming back from an injury, short-term albeit, I thought he played well and Lizzo had that energy that he always has. I thought that line, if that’s what the analytics spit out at the end of the night, it matched the eye test.

### [[Phillip Danault]]
> They pressure you everywhere, we’re not going to have time against them to make plays. They’re really aggressive, whether it’s on the kill or at 5-on-5, so they play tight, they have good structure, good team.

### [[Blake Lizotte]]
> Yeah, I think it started in our own end. I’m a player that takes pride in the d-zone so I think our offense comes a lot of times from our clean breakouts and I think we did that really well. It showed in the chances for and the chances against.

### [[Arthur Kaliyev]]
> We played great last game, we were physical, we were hunting pucks down and shooting pucks a lot. We had a lot of chances to score, we just have to bury them. We just have to keep playing the same way today.
