## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> They were missing some players but they’re still a damn good team and we kept that group to (19) even-strength shots, that’s not a bad night for our group.
> We were connected tonight, player-to-player, passing, structure-wise, we used our structure really well, especially at the end of the game.

> I bet you when \[[[Pheonix Copley]]] sits tomorrow, he’ll go ‘that’s not how I wanted to make that save,’ but he made it, and that’s important.

> \[[[Gabe Vilardi]]]’s become essential for us. He plays on the first power-play unit, he can play up or down the lineup, he scores timely goals.

### [[Alex Iafallo]]
> It was fun, we were just trying to stay on their D, stay on the hunt. Trying to support each other in every zone, it definitely helped going forward to get the three-on-twos and two-on-ones, so it was good execution.

> Everybody was playing good. They had good angles, angling the puck and trying to knock it down. Everybody was chipping in, making blocks and poking the puck out. If we keep having those team efforts, we’re going to win a lot of games.

> It was definitely a big game for us, for both teams, really, that’s two huge points.

### [[Phillip Danault]]
> We’ve been playing better defensively, so I think that creates more chances offensively. It’s weird to say, but you do the right things defensively, you get the chance to forecheck and you’re frustrating the other teams … and that’s where you get scoring chances.
