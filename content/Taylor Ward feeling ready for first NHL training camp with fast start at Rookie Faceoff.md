## Summary
> Since making the decision to sign with the LA Kings last spring, Taylor Ward has done everything he can to familiarize himself with the organization. As a free agent coming out of college after spending four seasons at the University of Nebraska-Omaha, Ward chose to begin his pro career with the Kings, agreeing to a one-year entry level deal on March 19.

## Notes
> I was on the phone a lot; I was doing a bunch of research and getting as much information as I could on what I wanted to do next and I had the opportunity to speak with pretty much everybody in this organization. I just loved what I heard from everyone and their emphasis on development so it just felt like the right fit and it’s a tough place to say no to so I didn’t. -- [[Taylor Ward]]

> I was thrown in there at the end of last season and into the playoffs, which actually helped me become pretty comfortable with the guys pretty quickly last year. -- [[Taylor Ward]]

> To be able to spend the summer here with a handful of Kings guys that I got to really watch and learn from, it was really cool. And now to be able to see those guys at the rink every day and feel comfortable, I’m enjoying it. I feel like it’s made my first few days here at rookie camp a lot easier, rather than just coming in without knowing anybody so I’m glad I did it and it was a great experience. -- [[Taylor Ward]]

> I felt pretty good there in the first game. It was the first game of my season and moving up there playing with Q and Madds, I thought we played well and we were creating offense. Obviously that’s more fun than playing in the D zone so that’s what we like to do. The coaches expressed that they were happy with how I was playing so that’s always good to hear as well. -- [[Taylor Ward]]

> “I didn’t really know him, but I’m very pleased. The way he plays, he reminds me of a few players I played with, so I think there’s something to it and he’s been really good, he’s a pleasant surprise. We’re going to try to keep pushing him to get more out of him, but so far, he’s had a really good tournament. -- [[Marco Sturm]] on [[Taylor Ward]]

> He just brings such a presence and he’s a very smart man. Anytime he opens his mouth, I’m trying to learn as much as possible, listen, and then apply what he’s saying to my game. The first few days have been great so far and I think everybody in the room is a big fan of his so I’m excited to keep playing for him. -- [[Taylor Ward]] on [[Marco Sturm]]

> It’s been really fun so far. I’ve never been at a rookie camp or anything like it before so I’m having fun with it. It’s cool to see some of your buddies on the other teams and obviously getting out there and putting on a Kings uniform is something special no matter where or when you’re doing it. -- [[Taylor Ward]]

> I didn’t want to come into my first main camp with no idea of what to expect and not knowing many people. So now to be able to come into camp and feel much more comfortable with the guys that are in the locker room and the coaching staff, training staff and everybody around, it’s definitely a big help for sure. I think I’d be much more nervous if I was back home the whole summer. -- [[Taylor Ward]]

> We’ve got some really smart guys up there in the gym in LA and the things we did were actually pretty interesting and very helpful. I feel like I’ve improved a lot over the last few months here and now I’m just hoping it translates onto the ice and I think it will. -- [[Taylor Ward]]

> Being at an NHL main camp is something that I’ve been dreaming about my whole life, so it’s a huge honor and I’m ready for it. I’m maybe a little bit nervous, but not too much. I’m excited. I feel good and I can’t wait for it to get going. -- [[Taylor Ward]]
