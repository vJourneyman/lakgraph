## Notes and Quotes
### [[Trevor Moore]]
> Phil and I haven’t been hard enough to play against lately.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> I think \[[[Viktor Arvidsson]]] is tremendous there and I have no issues putting him back there, I think \[[[Alex Iafallo]]] gives him a little bit more of a defensive conscience. When you’re at home and you can kind of match up a little bit better, it’s something we were looking for from that line. We challenged a couple of them on the road trip – Arvy wasn’t there at that time, so you can figure out who the couple is – about checking.
