## Notes and Quotes
### [[Marco Sturm]]
> We just got outworked, out-battled, and outplayed. That’s just the bottom line. There’s nothing to hide. I think we all saw it, and hopefully the players did too. We knew they were going to push back out there and we had nothing to push back with. That’s probably the most disappointing part of it.

> It’s always a big part. Our PK was just not ready today and our power play didn’t get it done either. We can’t rely on just goaltending every night. Sometimes you have to look in the mirror and push back on nights like that. Unfortunately, only a few guys did that tonight.

> We’re going to try to learn from that one. Hockey is not always great. There are going to be a lot of ups and downs. We’ve all done it before. So far its been really good, so maybe we were due. We’ve had some games with really good goaltending where we didn’t play well. Today, it was just overall not good enough. We just have to make sure that it’s not going to happen again.

### [[Alan Quine]]
> I think we had a game plan and we were right there, but then they got a couple quick ones on us. They’re a good team. We’ve been pretty fortunate with the way we’ve started the season, so that’s \[a game] we can learn from and analyze and move on. Hopefully it will help us down the stretch.

> We’d like to capitalize more, especially on the five minute advantage, but it’s a new group for me and we haven’t had a ton of practice time. I think the more power plays we get, the better we’re going to click and gel off each other. Its just a learning game for us so we’ve got to regroup for the next one.

> We’re trying to react off of each and every team, and each and every period. We’re all discussing how we can beat it and unfortunately we came up a little bit short tonight. It’s just one game and we’re going to learn from it.

> \[[[T.J. Tynan]]] and \[[[Lias Andersson]]] are great players so it was fun to play with them and get some chemistry. I think the more we play together, the more we’ll read off each other and know what each other’s tendencies are.
