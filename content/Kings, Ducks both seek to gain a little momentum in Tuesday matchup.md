## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> We talked about lessons and if we can string some games together. We’re just in the middle of the test right now. I don’t think we can grade the paper one bit.

> \[[[Pheonix Copley]]]’s fit in very well, which isn’t a surprise. He has experience and carries himself well. Guys enjoy being around him and want him to be part of the group. When he’s in the net, he looks confident and calm, which can calm things down for all of us. … Right now, he’s running hot and we’ll likely keep going there.

> We want to play tighter and stay out of the penalty box and give up fewer goals, but \[[[Pheonix Copley]]] plays a big part in that, as a goaltender, and he’s been doing that.
