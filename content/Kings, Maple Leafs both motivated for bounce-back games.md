## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> How much more evidence do we need that it doesn’t work?. Maybe we will become the run-and-gun team. I don’t like our chances, but if that’s how we want to play and that’s what we’re going to keep trying, we’re probably going to keep getting the same results.

> There are some things going on with Kopi’s line that I’m not happy with and I thought that Gabe needed an opportunity there. What we have right now isn’t working, so we’ll have to address it (at practice Friday).

### [[Anze Kopitar]]
> We can’t expect to win many games with giving up six goals. Whether we can blame it on the (penalty kill), not scoring on the power play, bad changes, turnovers, whatever, the bottom line is we can’t give up six and think we have a chance to win.
