## Notes and Quotes
### [[Rob Blake]]
> I think on the offensive side of things, you see a little bit of that production and handling more minutes. It’s a spot where \[[[Quinton Byfield]]] can work on a lot of aspects of his game, with multiple minutes down there.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> \[[[Quinton Byfield]]] went down, initially, to get his strength and his weight back which took some time and now he’s playing some games and he’s playing an impact role on that team. We get reports on him on a regular basis, on him and the team, everybody who’s playing. There have been some really good reports and then there have been some indifferent reports. He’s working on his game and working on the consistency in his game. Is he an important player, an important prospect, absolutely. Will he have an impact in the National Hockey League, absolutely.
