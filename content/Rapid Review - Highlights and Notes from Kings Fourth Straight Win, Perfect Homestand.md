## Summary
> Following Saturday night’s home game, coach Todd McLellan may have summed it up best when he talked about the Kings controlling play early before they decided to get a little too cute late in the contest. Detroit had LA on their heels in the final few minutes, however goalie Cal Petersen held strong in net and the Kings eventually skated off with a 4-3 victory. This also pushed LA’s record to a perfect 4-0 on the homestand. They’ll head to Calgary on Sunday and open up a four-game road trip vs. the Flames on Monday.
