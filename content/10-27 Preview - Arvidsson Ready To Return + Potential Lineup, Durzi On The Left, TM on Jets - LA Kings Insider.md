## Notes and Quotes
- ### Viktory
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Arvy is going to be able to go tonight. I thought Arvy was going to be able to go the other night until after warmups, but Arvy should be good to go.

> I sure hope so, he and we are all hoping that’s the case. Injury, double-bout of illness and we’re only a month into the season. It’s been a lot to go through, but it’s adversity. He’ll be fine.

### [[Viktor Arvidsson]]
> Yeah, I hope so. It’s just been bad bounces, being hurt, coming back, being sick, coming back and playing well but getting sick again. Hopefully this is the end and we can just work from here.

- ### Left Side, Strong Side
### [[Sean Durzi]]
> First of all, it’s playing within our team system and on the right side, it’s a little bit different. It’s kind of learning that aspect of it and not thinking about it as much and then once you get past that, you get your reps in, you work on it and you can play more freely and naturally like I usually do. Once I started getting used to playing within our system on the left side, I think everything else comes a little bit easier.

> Now that I’ve had a few games under my belt, with defending it’s a little bit different. I grew up on the right, hitting with this shoulder, hip check this way, you do everything the other way and then you switch. I’m comfortable playing the left and I think I can do it really well and with more reps, I’m not thinking about where I have to be within our structure and I can just play freely. When I’m playing freely, I’m at my best and I feel like I’ve been there for the last little bit.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> There’s a lot to learn when you do play your off side. Through no fault of his or anybody else that’s asked to go over there, it takes a while and situations arise that until you experience them, you really don’t know. We understand where to watch for it, we try and teach him those things, but it takes some time and it’s not an easy task.

- ### McLellan Talks Winnipeg
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Like all the teams, they’ve playedfew games this year, they have a new coaching staff and the coach has been sick so they’re trying to get their new systems and structure into place, but they played very hard. St. Louis, Rangers, in Colorado, those are their wins, so they’re beating some very good teams. Goaltending is outstanding, they seem to have the ability to grind really well below the tops of the circles in the o-zone, to keep a lot of plays alive. When you when you hear those characteristics, it’s the making a pretty good team, so we’ll have our hands full.
