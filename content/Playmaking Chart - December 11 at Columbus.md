## Summary
> Forum Report is very excited to bring you this feature, which will break simple possession statistics into a more nuanced understanding of who’s pushing the play towards the attacking net and how they’re doing it. It’s storytelling in chart form with some bullet points – a data-driven enhancement to what you saw the previous night. All statistics and commentary reflect the team’s five-on-five play.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Alex Faust]]
>  It frustrates Kings fans because it’s the same stuff that keeps happening.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> We’ve got to care about more situations that are important coming back to our end. We have world class players, guys that we brought in to be shutdown players, that missed assignments tonight. It’s not the bottom six. This is the top six right now. And that’s great that we’re scoring all these goals, but obviously we’re not getting enough points, and I’m not sure that we value the checking part as much as we have in the past. It’s just ‘go and score,’ and it’s disappointing. Another hard game to evaluate. I’ve been saying that pretty much the whole year. Great that we come back, great that we score goals, great that we stick with it, but the carelessness is killing us.
> Some of the situations, it didn’t matter if we had Drew and Rob Blake on the ice together. Forwards pinching at bad times, giving up three-on-ones, power play creating a turnover for a goal. It doesn’t matter who’s back there.
> And that’s where it’s confusing, really. We have outstanding efforts from a lot of guys, and they produce goals. Guys that maybe don’t score quite as much. And there’s others that just didn’t get it done when they needed to.

>  We were told after it was ruled upon, and obviously the league and the referees get together (and decided) that it was gloved ahead, but that we had possession. I obviously don’t agree with it, but there’s nothing I’m going to do about it.
