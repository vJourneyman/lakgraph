## Notes and Quotes
### [[Drew Doughty]]
> It was his first year last year so \[[[Sean Durzi]]] obviously had a lot to learn. He still does, as we all do.
> He's a good player who competes hard and has a lot of confidence. And what you need in this league to succeed is confidence. He definitely doesn't lack that. 

### [[Sean Walker]]
> I don't think \[[[Sean Durzi]]]'s underrated anymore. 
> I think he's certainly starting to show people that he's a really good NHL player. He's really good offensively, but his defensive game is also up there with everybody else. So, I don't think he can skate by anymore and be called underrated because he's proven it and continues to do it night in and night out. 

> Everybody has something to learn. 
> He just seems to pick them up quicker than most.

### [[Sean Durzi]]
> It's tough for me because drafting me was a dream come true for me, obviously. But the circumstances at the time made it a good move for both clubs. I'm just happy to show what I can do for this club and prove that these guys (the Kings) made the right choice. 

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> The biggest thing is that he knows he belongs here now, and we know that, too. 
> Sometimes, all a player needs is permission to be here. To know they belong.
