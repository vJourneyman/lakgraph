## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> I thought it was a gutsy point by our team. Gas tanks were running low and they check very well and it was a gutsy one by our team. Quick played well, there's a lot of clog up of the neutral zone by both teams, there's not a lot of free play. Penalties affected our start, at least our first period, the last thing we needed to do after basically playing three lines yesterday was to play basically six players for five minutes straight. But that's what happened today, penalties played a big part. I thought in the second, third we settled in and did a lot of things we wanted to do, but just couldn't find the net. 

> It all goes together, our group owed \[[[Jonathan Quick]]] a good honest effort and a checking effort, effort with a conscious. And we got that today and in return, he paid back the guys with some pretty big and timely saves. Not a lot of them, but timely ones when we needed them.
