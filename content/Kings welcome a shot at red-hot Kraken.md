## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> (Assistant coach) Jimmy Hiller’s been doing some really good things with our power play and the tree is starting to bear some fruit. Unless there’s a real strong work ethic to it, it doesn’t matter who you bring in or what he’s trying to do with the group. Our power play has had some good work ethic lately and it’s getting rewarded.

> Teams that have that element of a shot from there, that can score from distance or just power it by a goaltender, you have to respect it, and it can open up space for other players. If you don’t have it, they can cheat. They don’t have to worry so much about that side.
> I think you only have to look at number eight in Washington to see how that works. I’m not saying that Arthur is (Alex) Ovechkin, by no means, maybe later on in his career he’ll get there, but they both have that element of a shot from that spot.

> \[[[Anze Kopitar]]]’s been our best faceoff guy; we want him in those situations. He is calm and, you know what, he is so strong.
