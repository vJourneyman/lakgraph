## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> You look at it at 3-2, but then obviously the last two, the \[6-1 loss at] Pittsburgh (on Thursday), we weren't real pleased with. This game wasn't a disaster, although we gave up four in the third to lose it. So, we're still not where we need to be, quite frankly, and I think that's evident in the amount of goals we've given up.

### [[Viktor Arvidsson]]
> I think I've been playing pretty well this trip, better and better, and I think I got rewarded for it tonight. I'm more comfortable with the puck and making plays and I think we're starting to get our groove back, me, \[[[Phillip Danault]]] and \[[[Trevor Moore]]], and I think we're feeling better.

> The two first periods we really limited their chances and had good sticks, and then they hurt us in the third.
