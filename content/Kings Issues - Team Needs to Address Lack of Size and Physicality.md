## Summary
> It seems so long ago that teams dreaded playing the Los Angeles Kings. During the Cup years, every team knew they were in for a tough, physical battle against the Kings. Now, that identity is gone.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> The role that \[[[Brendan Lemieux]]] fills, the physicality, the battles, and the forecheck and the body contact can be shared by everybody. The policing part of it, every team might have one, some teams don't have any. That's where he specializes a little bit more than some other guys have.
