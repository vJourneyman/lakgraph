## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> The ones that got away on us ended up in the back of the net and it wasn’t the goaltender’s issue, it was ours, and they’re a pretty talented team. 

> We were going to give \[[[Alex Edler]]] a little bit of rest, but from what I understand, he wasn’t feeling really good either. But let’s not confuse that – we were going to pukll him out so that he could get rest.
> We’re a third into the season and I think we originally planned at the beginning of the year to consider it in back-to-back game situations because of injuries – or his own injury – he’s had to sit out or play in situations we didn’t anticipate, but he’s given us some really good games and is a big part of our team. We miss him when he’s not in the lineup.
