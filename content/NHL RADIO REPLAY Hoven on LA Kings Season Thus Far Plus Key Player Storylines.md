## Notes
- 00:01:14 
What needs to be corrected when it comes to identity?
[[Brandt Clarke]] and [[Gabe Vilardi]]
Has been concerned about the acquisition of [[Kevin Fiala]] early on. After a big acquisition, there's an instinct to wait for that person to do it. But that's not how the Kings achieved what they achieved.

- 00:03:12 
[[Gabe Vilardi]], [[Quinton Byfield]], and [[Alex Iafallo]] - How important will the line be?
More people should be talking about Vilardi. Mayor thinks he was the highest skill player in the prospect pool. He's now starting to show that.

- 00:04:25 
Acquiring [[Phillip Danault]] is insurance on [[Quinton Byfield]], letting him develop on his own pace. They need the kids to take a step forward. [[Arthur Kaliyev]] is on the fourth line instead of the third, which is a problem for his develop.

- 00:06:10 
Is the 0-2 start the team in front of [[Jonathan Quick]], or is it him? 
Quick stated that he wanted to play beyond this contract, which was surprising. [[Cal Petersen]] needs to step up and show more. The Kings need to start looking beyond Quick. If he's the playoff goaltender, Quick needs to be well rested. The Kings need balance and options in goal. More consistency needed from Petersen.

- 00:08:30
[[Brandt Clarke]]'s start refreshing? Does he stay past 9 games?
"I told you so." He's exciting to watch and has the, "It" factor. [[Drew Doughty]] asked [[Rob Blake]] if he was going to be kept around. Mayor thinks Clarke will be around all season, but the World Juniors is the wildcard. They might make him available for the tournament. The Kings roster is overloaded with right-handed d-men. [[Jim Hiller]] and [[Trent Yawney]] will take a big role in developing him.

- 00:12:05 
What about that surplus if right-shot D? Will they wait until the trade deadline? Or sooner?
They need to understand what they have. Is [[Sean Walker]] tradeable? Can he be packaged? What about [[Jordan Spence]], who belongs in the NHL? The roster needs a chance to play together and figure things out. The team has a treasure chest of prospects, which was the goal. Even with Brock Faber traded in the [[Kevin Fiala]] deal, the team is overloaded on RHD. They need to make sure that [[Alex Edler]] isn't playing >20 minutes a night or >65 games played.

- 00:14:35
Did the Kings overachieve last year?
Mayor doesn't think so. He was actually disappointed that they didn't beat the Oilers in game 6.
