## Notes and Quotes
### [[Adrian Kempe]]
> I think it was a good World Cup. One of the best finals I've ever seen for sure. A lot of upsets in the group stage, which is the usual, but kind of fun for the countries that win. Argentina ended up winning, that seems pretty fair, they played pretty good except the first game when they lost to Saudi Arabia but after that they were pretty good the rest of the tournament; they and Messi, I think, deserved it.

### [[Arthur Kaliyev]]
>  That was cool - one of the sickest finals I've watched. It's usually not much going on, a little bit boring, but that was really entertaining.

### [[Carl Grundstrom]]
>  \[It's a ] tough way to lose the final. I'm not a huge fan, but it's exciting to watch, so I'm fine with that.

### [[Sean Durzi]]
> I'm Portuguese, and I live or die on Portugal in any world setting in soccer, and the most memorable and my favorite was probably Ronaldo's penalty shot. To see him score again, first player, five World Cups, that was cool. 

> I liked it. I thought it was exciting. I mean, the game was awesome, but the pressure and everybody's watching just one shot each time, and one-on-one, that's exciting. 

> I wouldn't like it. I mean, it's a little different but if you put the puck on the spot, and one-on-one with the goalie, maybe it would be coolâ€¦but the breakaway setting for a defenseman, probably not for me. I would rather just have overtime for everybody.
