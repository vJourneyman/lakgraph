## Notes and Quotes
### [[Kevin Fiala]]
> It's just a great opportunity and a great organization. I see the team kind of coming up, you know? Made the playoffs last year, great group of guys I've heard, and on the ice, they're just getting better and better. The future's bright, I felt like, so I'm very happy with this.
