    > I dont see much for QB to learn in the A. If his stride was bad then working on that in the A is ideal like they did for Toffoli. Or, if he had to learn a new position like Vilardi - then send him down. One thing that hasnt been mentioned is the value of practicing with NHL talent and systems... that is only going to help his development to be defended by DD in practice and learning the breakout and eventually the PP with the big club. They are protecting him - like the way Kopi took a defensive zone faceoff for his line in Boston - which I like (to not put too much pressure on him). I wish they would give him some PP2 time - to get a little more time and space to be creative - to up his confidence. Otherwise im fine with whats happening now.

    > He had 20 pts in 32 games in the A last year (did you forget that?) - another 11 games this year on rehab stint . He's got nothing to learn down there - that seems to be the consensus - because he isnt really helping the team that much and is just in a learning the process / system mode.

When he decides to cut back to shake off a defender, he straightens his legs, then quickly sinks his pelvis to dig into the ice and change direction. This is sub-optimal because an NHL caliber defenseman can either push him off the puck as he lifts his body or catch up to him and get a stick on the puck when he slows to a near-standstill in the middle of his turn.

Give Byfield a quick pass on his backhand low in the defensive zone and see what happens: he stiffens up, his feet get stuck and he bobbles the puck. Hardly ideal for a center who is counted on to be flawless under pressure on breakouts.

    > > That is exactly how I feel. Just really wish he had gone through this season last year and was further along this season and then next year was maybe the big step year. Just doesn't seem like he gained anything by being in the AHL last year, which is frustrating. I thought maybe last year in the AHL would have made him further a long than he has shown. But he looks like an 18 year old kid fresh out of junior.

I wish the Kings had taken a similar path of development with QB. I wonder how he would look right now if he had 75 NHL games instead of 25.

    > At 19 years old though, Jack Hughes was receiving 19 minutes of ice time per game, including almost 3 minutes of power play time. Byfield has a total of 14 minutes on the power play for his whole career. Byfield's averaging fourth line minutes. Expecting much more than fourth line production is lunacy. He's essentially playing the same number of minutes as guys like Kyle Clifford, Jordan Nolan, and Andy Andreoff in years past.  
    >   
    > Hell, in Kempe's rookie season, he scored two goals and six points in 25 games playing 12:00 per game, and two of Kempe's four assists came on the power play. I don't particularly care where Byfield is today as long as he continues to grow and learn, but I will care where he is in a couple years.
