It's time for an update to our media/scout list. There's still lots of meaningful hockey to be played (rest of the CHL regular season, CHL playoffs, U18's), but it's always great to see how opinions change over the course of a season.

Just so happens that things have changed quite a bit. We've got a switch at the top of the list. The guy who placed 10th (Greg Meireles) last time around didn't even get a vote this time. And a ton of other movement up and down has occurred. The OHL has a few top notch prospects available for this draft (Tippett and Vilardi), and quite a few guys who are emerging as potential first rounders. The depth of the league is looking very strong with the potential to occupy close to 40% of the players drafted in the first two rounds. Because of this, the variance of opinion is quite vast. Not only are the masses split on who the top player is (11 to 6), but twelve different players received votes for the top 5. In addition to that, only four players received votes from all 17 contributors.

As always, it's important to note the contributors, as without them and their terrific insight, this article does not exist. For the midseason list, the following helped out:

Now here's the list and HM's:  
**1\. Owen Tippett - Forward - Mississauga Steelheads**  
Total Votes: 17  
High/Low Ranking: 1st (11x)/2nd (6x)  
Comments:  
"I just like his demeanor and mindset as a shooter. He plays the game hard and knows where to be to get himself in good scoring areas. Tippett, to me, has the best shot of this draft class; it's NHL caliber already. He can fire off a wrist, snap or slap shot very quickly and he gets a low of power behind it." - Morreale

"The unquestioned horse of the Steelheads has played a vital role in their current surge. Scouts are fighting wanting more consistency from him, but beware of having too high expectations - over a quarter of his games on the season have been multi-goal efforts. Size, speed, shot peppering forwards are always in high demand. Doesn't hurt that down the line, he has all the right ingredients to be one of the best players in the draft." - Mauro

"Tippett is one of the best shooters in the 2017 NHL Draft, someone who can cleanly beat goalies with his release. This season, he has unquestionably been Mississauga’s best player and a more dangerous offensive threat than captain and New Jersey Devils first rounder Michael McLeod." - Wheeler

"Tippett's games revolves around his lethal shot and scoring goals. His speed creates separation from defenders and allows him to get open, his size allows him to drive the net. He is able to release the puck with little to no warning as he disguises his shot effectively. While his whole game is in support of one aspect (scoring) it is a pretty sought after commodity in the pro level and I see his game transitioning well in higher levels." - Harling

"With goal scoring in the NHL at a premium snipers will always be coveted for the draft, and even if the Mississauga winger can be lax in his own zone at times or fail to find a linemate for a scoring opportunity far too often, he is going to score goals with his excellent release, accuracy and velocity." - McCagg

"Tippett is the most dynamic draft-eligible player I've seen in the OHL this season, and it's not that close. He has the rare combination of speed and lethal shot that will make him an offensive force at the next level. His defensive game is a work in progress, but there are signs of improvement. The reason he is first over Vilardi for me is higher upside at the next level. You can't teach what Tippett brings to the table." - Scheig  
**2\. Gabriel Vilardi - Forward - Windsor Spitfires**  
Total Votes: 17  
High/Low Ranking: 1st (6x)/2nd (11x)  
Comments:  
"Injuries and an appendectomy have cost Vilardi a lot of time this season. Despite that, he still tops the list for me. But you should be intrigued by the big center who can be just as effective playing the wing as he is down the middle. He isn’t the fastest or most elegant skater, but he makes up for any downfall with his hockey smarts, vision and work ethic.Vilardi plays a solid three zone game. He’s at his best when he has the puck on his stick, seemingly always in control. Below the dots, he’s a force and tough to beat. He can create chances for himself or his teammates. Quite simply, he makes everyone on the ice better." - Tiano

"Though there are some minor concerns about his skating, I still have Vilardi up top because he's a big, talented center and that's what the NHL craves. His hockey smarts and great and he can create goals in traffic." - Kennedy

“Impactful on the wing or at center as a goal scorer/playmaker duel threat. Makes skilled plays with his head and his hands. Has the size, skills and smarts that make me believe he will have no problems translating his game to the NHL level." - Stewart

"The thing about Vilardi is that he's very close to being NHL ready. The injury issues have been more a case of bad luck IMO, and not necessarily a concerning trend. If he puts in the work this summer, he could be an NHL player next year IMO (much like Matthew Tkachuk). This is because he controls play below the hashmarks so well and has such a good head for the game at both ends of the ice. He plays a very "pro style" game. His first few steps and top speed will need to improve, but it will. Reminds me so much of Sean Monahan in his draft year." - Otten

"The Kingston native is a bit of a 'safe' pick in the OHL draft class this season because he is such a well-rounded prospect who can chip in across all three zones. His skating is a glaring weakness but his soft hands, vision and ability to use his size and strength deep in the offensive zone are worthy of the praises that he's receiving. He will have an opportunity to showcase his talents deep into the season with the Spitfires acting as Memorial Cup hosts and it will be interesting to see whether he grabs a hold of the reigns and solidifies his top 10 selection. He's a player that's easy to like because of his smarts but you wonder how much offensive upside he owns and whether he can be considered a true top line forward at the next level." - Ross

**3\. Nic Hague - Defense - Mississauga Steelheads**  
Total Votes: 17  
High/Low Ranking: 3rd (8x)/6th (3x)  
Comments:  
"I'm sure many will focus on his size and projection as a shut down type of defender. But I'd rather talk about the interesting progression of his offensive game. He's not your prototypical offensive defender. He's not a particularly dynamic player off the rush and I don't think he's got a natural feel as a puck carrier/distributor. But, he uses his size exceptionally well in the offensive end. Consistently pinches in deep to keep pucks in, and actually plays a lot below the hash marks, using his size to work the cycle. He's smart about it though and doesn't get caught up ice all that much. Then there's the big point shot. He does a great job of finding scoring lanes and he actually does a good job of using different releases to get it through to the net. I don't know how much that will translate to the next level, but the improvements and confidence in his ability to make things happen in the offensive end is worth noting." - Otten

"Started out slowly but his game continues to improve...Has the biggest shot from the point in the Draft." - Seidel

"The size and reach are great, but the scouts I talk to wonder about his next-level projection in terms of offence. Seems like he'll be a shutdown guy if he continues to improve his skating." - Kennedy

"He has the enviable size for a defensemen, but the offensive numbers put up in the OHL are curious.  He wasn't a scorer at all in minor midget, but has double digit goals in both his OHL seasons, and you do not often see that from a D man.   Took a vicious knee on knee from Chandler Yakimowicz, and while that won't affect his draft status, hopefully he will be able to showcase his skills in the post season." - Clark

"Hague should be the first defenceman taken from the OHL, he has a tremendous package of size, skating and offensive ability. His performance this season has not been as dominant as I had predicted but big defencemen sometimes develop a little slower. The point is he has developed this year and his ceiling is very high. To acquire defencemen of his abilities in the NHL you have to draft them so look for Hague to go off the board early in the first round." - Harling

**4\. Nick Suzuki - Forward - Owen Sound Attack**  
Total Votes: 17  
High/Low Ranking: 3rd (4x)/10th (1x)  
Comments:  
“Two-way center who has been a major component for the impressive Attack squad this season. His intelligence and drive are impressive but his size and how his game will translate because of it at the NHL level is still a question in my mind." - Stewart

"Suzuki is the 2017 NHL Draft’s everyman, a player who has quickly emerged as one of the most well-rounded prospects in the class. Were it not for a diminutive stature, Suzuki’s success this season would have made him a lock as a top-10 pick in 2017." - Wheeler

"Growing up in London, Suzuki has been a familiar prospect dating back to his Jr. Knights days and much is the same with this well-rounded, intelligent player. He continues to be one of the smartest and hardest working players in his age group but he's been able to take his production up to a level that wasn't entirely expected. Another safe prospect to become an NHL player given his "complete" game style, Suzuki can easily be slotted into a middle six role and thrive playing special teams. He processes the game intelligently and has great timing, allowing him to arrive on pucks in optimum locations for scoring chances. Suzuki may never be counted on to carry an NHL offence but, much like Bo Horvat, he'll become a great two-way player who produces more than people expect." - Ross

"One of the most likable players in this draft class because of his hustle and consistency. Dating back to last year, he's been one of the most impressive 99's in the OHL ([I had him ranked as the 3rd most impressive rookie last year](http://ohlprospects.blogspot.ca/2016/03/sunday-top-10-most-impressive-born-1999.html)). Does everything for the Attack and projects as a very well rounded NHL player too. I think the scary thing about Suzuki though is that he's still pretty physically immature. He's one of the youngest players available in the draft, with room to grow in his puck protection ability and skating strength. Perhaps there's even a late growth spurt in there too. With a strong performance in the OHL playoffs and/or the Under 18's, Suzuki is a guy who I could see sneaking into the lottery." - Otten

"Exceptional two-way player who was a key part of the Attack’s 16 game winning streak. Among draft eligible players he’s second in points, first in assists, second in plus/minus, third in faceoff percentage, second longest goal scoring streak of the season, fourth in shot attempts and second in shots on goal. Suzuki is a superb skater with exceptional hockey sense. In my opinion, he’s been the most consistent forward from the start until now." - Tiano

**5\. Robert Thomas - Forward - London Knights**  
Total Votes: 15  
High/Low Ranking: 3rd (1x)/Outside of the Top 10 (2x)  
Comments:  
"The Aurora native has always landed high in my rankings even dating back to his OHL draft season with the York Simcoe Express. His emergence may have surprised many but it's been more of a "wait-and-see" approach for me because when a player of his smarts and skill comes along, you just know it's a matter of time before he's going to be turning heads. Thomas' is a cerebral attacker who's at his best with the puck on his stick allowing him to dictate the speed and direction of attack. He processes the game at a high level and can break down defences with quick timely passes or elusive in-control maneuver to create scoring lanes. His game reminds me of Robby Fabbri where he doesn't rely just on speed or pure dangles but rather a slick combination of the two. His size is less than ideal but he's a smart player who reads and reacts accordingly with confidence to leave his mark on every shift. Truthfully, he's right there with Suzuki and Hague on my list." - Ross

"His terrific smarts and speed helped make him a standout in most games...makes a ton of subtle little plays that may not always go noticed but buy him a bit more time or free up someone else for a nice pass.  He seems incapable of playing a poor game due to his work ethic, terrific sense and skating ability." - McCagg

"The kid does it all for London...Has more offense than some think but is smart all over the ice." - Seidel

"Well, he wasn’t on my list in your first poll early in the season, but he’s come up very quietly. One of the smartest players in the draft class who always seems to find himself in the right place at the right time. Thomas is an exceptional skater with blazing speed with or without the puck. His vision is superb and he is so smart. He could very well be the best playmaker available. He’s become a key player for Coach Hunter who uses him in all situations. He’s become a key pk’er and on the pp, if you don’t keep him close and in your vision, you’re going to get burned." - Tiano

**6\. Matthew Strome - Forward - Hamilton Bulldogs**  
Total Votes: 14  
High/Low Ranking: 4th (1x)/Outside of the Top 10 (3x)  
Comments:  
"Matthew is more grittier than his two older brothers. He'll move into the corners, make or take a hit and get to the front of the net for loose pucks. He's a prototypical power forward with good finishing ability. The one knock has been his skating but he's been working extremely hard to improve that area of his game." - Morreale

"There's no denying that Strome has next level abilities but I am slightly more hesitant on the Bulldogs forward. He's a very smart player who reads the ice very well but his skating leaves a lot to be desired and while it's an area that can be improved easier than others, it still concerns me heading into the next level. He's a player who excels as a playmaker and can execute highly difficult plays but whenever I watch him, he never has the puck as much as I'd want." - Ross

"The first thing that jumped out to me watching Strome was "Mark Stone"- the ability to score, be a power forward, create havoc out front, and he has a nice edge to his game.  Sure the skating needs work, but he knows that and has already committed to off season training." - Clark

"Strome fell a bit in my rankings, but it is more due to the play of others being elevated. However, the stretch in December when Matt Luff and Niki Petti were injured Strome showed he wasn't ready to carry an offense. Still there are bright spots to his game and signs to be optimistic. He is bigger and more willing to use his size than his brothers and has the versatility and the instincts to be a very solid 2 way player." - Kneulman

**7\. Isaac Ratcliffe - Forward - Guelph Storm**  
Total Votes: 11  
High/Low Ranking: 3rd (3x)/Outside of the Top 10 (6x)  
Comments:  
"Had a very impressive Top Prospects game performance where he stood out for his size, offensive ability and his defensive play. While the NHL is allowing smaller skill players more regularly into the league, there will always be a preference to bigger players if all things are equal. Ratcliffe may not have elite hands for the NHL but he is more than adequate and skating is not a liability either. Already at 6-5 at 18-years-old he should project as an ideal power forward." - Harling

"Towering kid comes from an athletic family and is really progressing well with the Storm. Combination of puck sense, size and physicality is tantalizing." - Kennedy

“Tall and gangly with lots of room to add muscle but his on-ice game is progressing at a very good clip this season. Skates better than you would expect a growing 6-6 kid too and has some real offensive potential. Dangerous anywhere around the crease." - Stewart

"The power forward who can skate and possesses very soft hands has been coming on lately. I think he’s underrated offensively in some circles. He’s a physical beast who can play a very mean game. Almost impossible to knock off the puck and uses his size and strength to maintain possession. Right now, he’s probably the best prospect in front of the goal, battling for space and loose pucks and banging in rebounds. We caught a glimpse of that in the Top Prospects game. The scary thought is he’s still going to grow and get stronger." - Tiano

**8\. Michael Dipietro - Goaltender - Windsor Spitfires**  
Total Votes: 12  
High/Low Ranking: 4th (2x)/Outside of the Top 10 (5x)  
Comments:  
"May be a little high for a goalie but there is no denying that DiPietro may be the best Ontario born goalie at this age in the last 10 years. When he is not setting team records for shutouts in a season or playing the Grinch and preventing children from getting teddy bears for Christmas he is using his size and elite positioning and anticipation skills to keep a Windsor team beset by injuries competitive. Sometimes I feel there is a bias towards Ontario born goalies and really with their minimal success at the next level I cant fault anyone for having that bias. DiPietro however should quell some of those thoughts even if NHL central scouting is slow to realize it." - Kneulman

"Where would Windsor be without DiPietro in net? He has been a workhorse for the Spitfires and has already won 20-plus games. He isn't the biggest goalie of this draft class and, because of that, his athleticism and high-end skills need to be high end and they are. He has an excellent glove hand and is very square to the shooters. He's a player you can't help but root for." - Morreale

"Any goaltender who has a chance of being selected in the first round deserves a lot of attention. DiPietro is the best goaltender I've seen in the league since perhaps Matt Murray. He's not big, but is very athletic and technically sound. He is excellent at anticipating a play and being ready to stop it. The extra time playing for the Memorial Cup hosts will only help him play in pressure situations. He has the upside of a number one in the NHL." - Scheig

"If goaltenders get better with age, it’ s downright scary to think how good Di:ietro will be by the time he reaches his mid-20’s. Poised, quick and cerebral, the Windsor Spitfire leads all OHL netminders in every major statistical category, including a mind-numbing six shutouts in 37 games. Want more? DiPietro has the best high-danger save percentage (.839) of any OHL goalie who has faced over 1000 shots." - Kournianos

**9\. Alex Formenton - Forward - London Knights**  
Total Votes: 8  
High/Low Ranking: 6th (2x)/Outside of the Top 10 (9x)  
Comments:  
" Considering Formenton was ranked 49th on my final OHL Draft ranking in 2015, it's safe to say that this high ranking should come at no surprise. The Knights grabbed the undersized forward with their 216th selection that season and are looking like geniuses less than two years later. He was a top performer at CHL/NHL Top Prospects Game testing and has had a great season with London drawing more minutes in his second season. He's sprouted up eight inches since his pre-OHL days and is now skating at 6-foot-1. His enthusiastic attack mixes good levels of grit and skill and he's a player who always seems to be around the puck. Deceptively slick hands in flight allow him to dance defenders with quick plays and good use of his wingspan. He's not afraid to stick his nose in and get dirty either, taking hits to make plays and driving the net hard for second chance opportunities. There's a lot to like about Formenton's game and I think the best is yet to come." - Ross

"Amazing set of physical skills, he won the on-ice combine at the Top Prospects Game. Also plays physical and has a nice scoring touch." - Kennedy

"Formenton possesses a lot of speed and is a very good skater. I wouldn’t hesitate in saying he’s one of the top ten fastest skaters in the OHL. He drives the puck wide with more confidence, often burning defenders very much like the way Zach Senyshyn does with the Soo Greyhounds. Like all Hunter teams, you must be able to play in all three zones and Formenton has come a long way. He has the same worth ethic in the defensive zone as he does in the offensive zone." - Tiano

"King City native has wheels and length right now after enduring a growth spurt and being one of the youngest in the draft. Boasts a truly unique and exciting development curve that hasn't even begun to take shape, really. Needs to be settle down offensively on the attack, but that will come. It's not often you find a kid with sky high potential who works his ass off and is this defensively aware." - Mauro

**10\. Ivan Lodnia - Forward - Erie Otters**  
Total Votes: 7  
High/Low Ranking: 3rd (1x)/Outside of the Top 10 (10x)  
Comments:  
"In terms of overall skill set, I haven't seen anyone all season bring more to the table than Lodnia. He is a threat every time he touches the puck and can beat you in so many ways. Whether he's driving the net and scoring, or dangling around another defender, Lodnia uses his creativity to get open and make plays. Size and skating seem to be a knock on him. He shot up to 5-foot-11 this season, but appears to have lost a step in his skating. His skating is still good and he's not done growing yet. He's also been buried in the Otters lineup at times, which explains why some of his numbers might be "down". He has the makings of being a day two bargain at the draft with day one talent." - Scheig

"Lodnia has played less of a roll since Erie’s trade deadline acquisitions of Anthony Cirelli and Warren Foegele, but he’s an offensive threat in his own right and a kid who can create as a shooter and as a passer." - Wheeler

"Another short, but not small player at 5-10. Lodnia has plenty of hockey strength and has shown his offensive ability consistently this season. While his offensive production is not at the top of the league, he brings the same compete level every time I see him. Scouts will like that." - Harling

"Lodnia is a very well rounded offensive player. Even though he's on the smaller side, I love his intensity in the offensive end. Makes a lot of plays within 5 feet of the crease. Also think he has high hockey sense and does well moving without the puck. That said, my concern is that he's an undersized scorer who isn't the world's greatest skater. He's not explosive, nor does he possess high end speed. Worth noting that he's hit a growth spurt and as such may be lacking in strength, but I do wonder if he's a Dante Salituro type of player who armchair scouts like a lot more than actual ones." - Otten

**Honorable Mentions**

**Sasha Chmelevski - Forward - Ottawa 67's (7 Votes)**  
Highest Ranking: 4th (1x)  
Comments:  
“A constant threat to score but does not always give a consistent effort. His skills are top 20 in the draft class but he has only displayed them in flashes. This ranking is based off what he can do and a hope that he will realize the kind of effort it will take to get to the NHL." - Stewart

"Inconsistency has been a problem this season for Chmelevski, he was great in a pre-season tournament, cooled off after the season started but was very good at the Top Prospects game. Perhaps he is struggling in Ottawa where he is missing elite level talent to play with. Elite players should not need to depend on teammates so that’s a red flag for me, but there is no denying his skill." - Harling

"Crafty American pivot who is a money player when his team needs a big play. Chmelevski was the critical piece Sarnia shipped to Ottawa in last year’s Travis Konecny trade, and he’s rewarded them with a team-best 10 power-play goals and is their best player at the dot (56%). Chmelevski has a deadly shot and takes high percentage shots, but his even strength production (15 ES points in 39 games) is a tad worrisome." - Kournianos

"Has hit some ruts with the 67s, but the high-end skill is obvious. He's very patience and crafty when the puck is on his stick and he can really wire it." - Kennedy

**Conor Timmins - Defense - Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds (7 Votes)**  
Highest Ranking: 4th (1x)  
Comments:  
"Timmins is a very smart defenseman; he has good vision and good offensive instincts. He can read the play well, and his passing ability allows him to be a constant threat in the transition game. I like his poise under pressure, something I feel extremely important in a young defenseman." - Morreale

"Has crept into my top 10 and is well deserving of it. With a lot of draft eligible players having up and down spurts this year, Timmins might just be the most consistent of the bunch. From the get go this year, he's been the Greyhounds' best defender (on a team with two 19 year old NHL drafted blueliners). Timmins is just an exceptionally well rounded player who is actually close to being pro ready IMO. Makes a great first pass, brings intensity to the defensive end and skates well." - Otten

"A prototypical new age defender who is an elite puck mover. Timmins was born to play in the system the greyhounds have and has thrived in it. With 2 NHL defenders ahead of him at the start of the season Timmins has seemingly passed them on the depth chart and has been an important offensive cog with the high scoring Greyhounds. Another late birthday who made his OHL debut last season Timmins thrived in protected minutes finishing 3rd among rookies in +/- ( I know it is flawed stat but impressive given his age). This season in more leveraged minutes against high quality competition he hasn't missed a beat and is currently 6th in the league in that category and first among Draft Eligibles. He also leads draft eligibles in assists." - Kneulman

"One of the big risers in my opinion. Timmins plays in any situation for the Greyhounds. Despite being “only” 6’1” he plays with the physical intensity of someone more like 6’5”. He does not shy away from the physical battles in corners, along the boards or in front of his own goal. He can and does throw open ice hits. Offensively, Timmins thinks the game very well and along with his vision makes him dangerous from the point. Whether its finding seams to set up teammates or getting a diversity of shots through to the goal, he is very proficient. He quarterbacks the powerplay exceptionally well. He leads all draft eligible defencemen points and plus/minus. By the time the season is over, he could be challenging Hague." - Tiano

**Mackenzie Entwistle - Forward - Hamilton Bulldogs (7 Votes)**  
Highest Ranking: 7th (3x)  
Comments:  
"Coming down with Mono this week will likely hurt him as his play has some what flat lined in the new year. Still he is a strong two-way winger with untapped offensive potential. Shows great drive and a willingness to go in the dirty areas but the skill to score outside of them. My only fear with him is a team drafts him and brings up to the NHL too so to cheaply fill a bottom 6 role thus stunting his development by having him play a more physical role similar to Tom Wilson. While I feel he could thrive in that role he has too much offensive potential and if he is given time to develop could be a real treat to watch in the coming years." - Kneulman

"While he may lack high-end puck skills and lateral mobility, he is a strong north-south skater with smarts who works hard at both ends of the ice.  He looks like a safe bet to one day play in the NHL...the question will be on what line?" - McCagg

"The offensive numbers have really declined in recent months and he's dropping like a stone on a lot of draft lists. But I've still got him at the back end of my top 10. The Top Prospect's Game was a great showcase for him. Still think he's got more offensive potential and better hands than people give him credit for. As he fills out, I think he could be a real force at both ends of the ice. If Hamilton falters in the OHL playoffs, I really hope he plays a large role for Canada at the U18's, where I think he could really shine." - Otten

"A big frame that understands the game as well as some coaches...Excellent on the PK and defensively while his offensive game is developing." - Seidel

**Morgan Frost - Forward - Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds (6 Votes)**

"There seems to be a theme in the OHL with less-heralded players spring boarding into top draft prospect discussions, and Frost is certainly one of them. Not only was he a fourth round pick in the 2015 Priority Selection, but he plays on a roster loaded with NHL draftees. But there he is, second in team scoring with 42 points and centering either of the Soo’s top two lines. Frost is an outstanding set-up man who can thread the needle, but he’s guilty of forcing passes while operation in the Greyhounds’ struggling power play." - Kournianos

"I thought Frost was a nice story last year. The son of a famous PA Announcer playing OHL hockey. I did not think more of him.  Then he showed the work ethic, skill set and a little bit of a jam to really differentiate himself as a player on an outstanding team.  A bit of a sleeper.  I don't think he gets drafted 1st round, but is great value in the 2nd round.  And yes, you can see elements of his dad Andy's voice when he talks!" - Clark

"Frost has been a very pleasant surprise for me. He's always had good hands and is great with puck possession. He's improved his speed and strength this season, allowing him to beat defenders in a variety of ways. He's an underrated play maker who is confident with the puck. If he gets a little more size, he becomes a player with intriguing upside at the next level." - Scheig

"Frost as the ability to score in a multitude of ways and that versatility has allowed him to work his way up the depth chart on a very deep Greyhounds team. His strong play helped the team overcome the loss of Blake Speers early in the season. He has a great shot and an ability to find open spaces on the ice that has allowed him to thrive on the power play. At times he has played the point on the power play for the Hounds this year only to come up with a great defensive play to prevent a short handed opportunity. Can affect the game even when he isn't scoring and has the upside of a 2nd line scoring winger at the next level." - Kneulman

"Phillips has made real strides in his overall game this season. I wanted to see more offense in his game and he has started to bring that. He couples that with a very responsible game in his own end, making smart decisions. He's a little undersized, but strong. He has the kind of game that can translate well to the next level, once he fills out and continues to add offense." - Scheig

"Slightly undersized, but I don't think that hurts Phillips because he's got very good lower body strength and a wide base. While many seem to be touting Phillips as an offensive type of defender, I actually see him being more of a shut down type at the next level. He's one of the OHL's more agile defenders, moving exceptionally well backwards and laterally, and it makes him very difficult to beat one on one. His overall defensive awareness is strong too. And when you add in his great leadership potential and poise, I think you've got the makings of a Marc-Edouard Vlasic type of player." - Otten

"It’s been a grind-it-out kind of season for this towering Slovakian two-way center, who is putting together a solid rookie season when you consider 26 of his 32 points have come in the last 30 games. It took Ruzicka a few weeks to adapt to North American hockey, and a solid showing at the WJC as one of Slovakia’s younger forwards seems to have spring boarded him into a productive second half. He is prone to make odd decisions with the puck, but we chalk it up to trying to adapt to a new league and zip code." - Kournianos

"His hockey sense and vision allow him to have success playing all three forward positions. He's just as capable setting up plays as he is finishing them and possesses an excellent touch around the net. He moves very well for his size (6-3, 202) and has deceptive speed." - Morreale

**Jason Robertson - Forward - Kingston Frontenacs (2 Votes)**  
Highest Ranking: 6th (2x)

"Despite strong size, Robertson isn’t an overwhelming on-ice presence. Still, he has been the brightest spot on a low-scoring Frontenacs team as its top offensive threat. Robertson has a number of transferable NHL tools — an exciting package." - Wheeler
