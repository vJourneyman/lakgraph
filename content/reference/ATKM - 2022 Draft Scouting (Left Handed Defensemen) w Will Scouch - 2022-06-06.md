1:00 Intro
1:30 Will Scouch - Scouching.ca
4:20 LD is shallowest part of the pool
4:45 Pavel Mintyukov - Saginaw Spirit, 6-foot-1
	Probably going earlier than 19th
	Big, skilled, rangy
	Projects well into the NHL
	6'2" - 6'3"
	Could wear multiple hats
	Already in North America (Saginaw), so no KHL transfer issue
9:12 Vladimir Grudinin - Krasnaya Armiya Moskva, 5-foot-10
	Played well in the KHL, but played outside
	Makes up for size, quick on the pivot to offense
	Light at 159, but again makes up for it
	Would draft in the 4th
17:22 Mats Lindgren - Kamloops Blazers, 5-foot-11
	Mohawk skating, useful but can be limiting
	Reliable passer, good D-to-D
	Wants to see more from him offensively
	Work in progress, defensively
	Blank slate, needs development
	Late 2nd to 3rd
21:01 Isaiah George - London Knights, 6-foot-1
	Fluid, mobile, smart positioning
	Solid defense-first hockey
	Slight, needs filling out
	Instincts to close gaps, challenge along the boards, push guys out of lanes and off the puck
	Maybe a good 2nd round pick
	Strengths: skating, versatility, athleticism, moving the puck in transition
25:32 Lane Hutson - U.S. NTDP, 5-foot-8
	Lacks explosive quickness
	With the puck, confident, skilled, decptive, creative
	Driving pucks to middle of ice, getting pucks to o-zone, pushing into the o-zone, completing a lot of passes
	Can get out of pressure with skating, vision, and passing
	Probably not in the first two rounds
	Needs work on quickness and fluid movement
	Supposedly comes from a family that sprouts closer to 20. His brother went from 5'7" to 6' from 17 to 19
