**What The Experts Said**

**[Via Corey Pronman (subscribe to The Athletic here)](https://theathletic.com/2085858/2020/09/29/2020-nhl-draft-board-corey-pronmans-final-top-131-prospects/)**  
Simontaival’s star has faded a bit from where he was around midseason a year ago when he looked like a true top prospect in his age group. But he remains a very quality player with a lot of intriguing offensive attributes. He’s got a very quick stick and can beat defenders with his skill. I wouldn’t call him a top playmaker, but he can find the seams on the ice well and flash high-end vision. His shot is more impressive to me than his passing, although I think both are certainly strong points. The main areas of concern for Simontaival are his small frame and just fine skating. I think his edgework is good and he’s shifty in small spaces, but he lacks any real speed and his stride breaks down more than you’d like for a small forward. He does compete well and is good around the net, but he isn’t that strong in puck battles or defensively.

**[Via ESPN’s Chris Peters](https://www.espn.com/nhl/insider/story/_/id/29994322/2020-nhl-draft-rankings-final-top-100-prospects-class-chris-peters-plus-position-rankings)**  
He’s small but quick with excellent hands and a desire to create. Simontaival put up big numbers in Finland’s top junior league this season but couldn’t quite find his game against pros. There’s a lot of room for him to improve certain elements of his game, but I think his speed helps lessen any size worries.

**[Elite Prospects 2020 Draft Guide](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/397010/kasper-simontaival)**  
He’s a true dual-threat winger with two-way upside, a sturdy frame, and the type of competitiveness necessary to hang in there as a vertically-challenged forward. The 5-foot-9 winger has a lethal release that can beat goalies from tough angles and long distances. He wields the best shot out of Finland in this year’s draft.
