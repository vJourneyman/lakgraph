                      2019 NHL Draft Profile: C Trevor Zegras | RSN

JUN 18, 2019

PRESENTED BY BLACKHAWKS INSIDERS

From June 10-20, Charlie Roumeliotis will profile one top prospect per day — 11 total — leading up to the 2019 NHL Draft as the Blackhawks prepare to pick third overall.

## Trevor Zegras

**Position:** Center  
**Height:** 6-foot-0  
**Weight:** 169 pounds  
**Shoots:** Left

**Scouting report from Blackhawks vice president of amateur scouting Mark Kelley:**

"Trevor is a high skilled centerman, very good skater, very, very creative, comfortable and creative with the puck."

**Zegras describes his own game:**

On his creativity: "I think growing up, watching a bunch of guys in the NHL like Patrick Kane mess around the ice, just something I’ve always done as a little kid. Maybe I rolled into the driveway and work on fun passes. It’s what I’m really good at."

**NHL player comparable:** Patrick Kane

**Fit for Blackhawks:**

Talk to any player on USA Hockey's National Team Development Program and they'll say Zegras was the most offensively gifted player of the group, which is saying a lot when you consider some of the names he's up against (Matthew Boldy, Cole Caufield, Jack Hughes, Alex Turcotte, to name a few).

At the NHL scouting combine, Zegras mentioned Kane several times as somebody he tries modeling his game after. The vision, the passing, the skating, the playmaking ability, the hockey IQ. He has it all offensively, and also doesn't get enough credit for his two-way game.

Zegras is somebody that has quickly been rising on draft boards, and it's because he has the potential to be a 90-point player in the NHL as a center. His name has been discussed by the Blackhawks at No. 3 and he's certainly a tempting option. Pair Zegras with Kane for the next decade and it's scary to think about the numbers the two could put up together.
