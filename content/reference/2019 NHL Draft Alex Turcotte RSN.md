JUN 14, 2019

PRESENTED BY BLACKHAWKS INSIDERS

From June 10-20, Charlie Roumeliotis will profile one top prospect per day — 11 total — leading up to the 2019 NHL Draft as the Blackhawks prepare to pick third overall.F

## Alex Turcotte

**Position:** Center  
**Height:** 5-foot-11  
**Weight:** 185 pounds  
**Shoots:** Left

**Scouting report from Blackhawks vice president of amateur scouting Mark Kelley:**

"Alex is a highly skilled, strong, highly competitive, good two-way centerman."

**Turcotte describes his own game:**

"I think I have a lot of skill but also I’m not afraid to go to the dirty areas and then take it to the net, grind it out in the corners. I’m really competitive and I think that’s what drives me and my game and that’s a big part of my game, how competitive I am and how bad I want to win and be the best."


**NHL player comparable:** Jonathan Toews

**Fit for Blackhawks:**

There's a lot to like about Turcotte. He's not as flashy as some of the other top prospects, but he certainly has playmaking ability and is reliable in all three zones. Turcotte is cut from the same cloth as Patrice Bergeron and Toews, and will probably be a consistent Selke Trophy nominee in the NHL.

That's the type of center that could grab the attention of the Blackhawks, who tend to gravitate towards high-end centers that play a 200-foot game. Turcotte committed to play for Wisconsin next season so he wouldn't make the jump to the pros until at least the 2020-21 season, but that's likely going to be the case for every center drafted after Jack Hughes.

The interesting part of the equation is how the puzzle pieces fit beyond next season for the Blackhawks with Toews and (soon to be) Dylan Strome locked up as the 1-2 punch down the middle for many years to come.
