Roster building is sort of like cooking: every flavor has merit, but the most delicious meals are crafted with the right high-quality ingredients from a chef who knows how to mix everything together. Stylistically, there isn’t one right answer for how to build a team, as long as it’s constructed with good players that fit properly throughout the lineup.

The Stanley Cup recipe is a difficult one to master as there are different ways to interpret it, but looking at how it was cooked before offers some helpful patterns toward success. Based on a decade of championship meals from the 2010s, there are 10 common elements to look for when crafting a team worthy of contending. Every fine meal starts with a grocery list, and this one — the [Cup Checklist](https://theathletic.com/2077279/2020/09/21/cup-checklist-analyzing-the-rosters-from-the-last-decade-of-champions/) — is no different.

-   Elite first-line center that’s among the very best players in the world.
-   Elite first-line winger to support the elite center.
-   Two other top-line wingers on each of the top two lines.
-   Top-line center to play behind the elite center. 
-   Two more top-six forwards for depth in the middle six.
-   Elite No. 1 defenseman.
-   A second No. 1 defenseman to play behind him. 
-   A top-pairing defenseman to help anchor a strong second pair with the No. 2. 
-   Another top-pairing caliber defender to crush soft minutes on the third pair. 
-   A top-10 caliber starting goaltender.

It’s possible to make a great-tasting meal that’s Cup-worthy without every ingredient accounted for, but the best meals are the ones that have as many ingredients accounted for as possible. Not every team has it all, but the ones that have the most are the ones that are usually closest to competing for the Stanley Cup.

So does your team’s meal belong on Master Chef or Kitchen Nightmares? That’s the question teams have to be asking themselves going into the trade deadline because it’s the last chance to go to the market and improve their dish with a secret ingredient or two before it heads to the oven.

Every team will find themselves shopping over the next week with one common goal — to make the best meal possible. Some teams only need a finishing touch, some teams need spices to kick the flavor up a notch, and some teams are missing an entire side dish.

The [Kings](https://theathletic.com/team/kings/) are one of this year’s biggest surprises and the model is still very steadfast that what we’re seeing out of them is a mirage. The depth remains a question mark across the board and the elite core simply isn’t what it needs to be to contend. It’s enough to be a playoff team — especially with the way [Viktor Arvidsson](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/kings/viktor-arvidsson/) and [Drew Doughty](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/kings/drew-doughty/) have performed this year — but contending is a whole other ball game. Los Angeles isn’t ready for that yet. It might be worth pursuing some players with term — Jakob Chychrun comes to mind — but rentals should be out of the question. Either way, there shouldn’t be pressure to make a splash for this year’s playoffs.
