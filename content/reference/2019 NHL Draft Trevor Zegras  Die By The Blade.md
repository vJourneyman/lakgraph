DBTB –

The [Buffalo Sabres](https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/teams/buffalo-sabres) fanbase received a bit of disappointment at the [NHL Draft](http://www.sbnation.com/nhl-draft) Lottery, as they fell from #5 overall to #7. But do not despair. The good news is that regardless of selection #5 or #7, they will add an excellent, high-end prospect to a fairly deep pool of young players.

The question is, who is that prospect?

There is a pile of players in the #3-#12 range that Jason Botterill could believably target given the Sabres need for more talent is pretty broad. All sorts of skill sets, from big playmaking centermen to small, quick goal scoring wings can be had at that #7 spot. I’ll take this opportunity to profile one here.

**TREVOR ZEGRAS, C/LW, US DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM**

A 5’11 1/2, 170# left-shot forward who is comfortable in the middle or on the wing, Zegras is a 2001-born player from downstate in Bedford, New York. An absolutely dynamite playmaking forward, he’s one of the top passers in the Draft Class. Most importantly, he can make elite plays at top speed. Has been very good all year, having scored the game-winner at the All-American Top Prospects game at the start of the season, and named the best player for the USA at the 5 Nations tournament in February. Notched an impressive 87 points in 60 games for the NTDP, shockingly only 4th on the NTDP in terms of points-per-game. Added 9 points in 5 games for the US in the Under-18 World Championships, despite coming off a shoulder injury in the preliminary games that kept him out of the first couple of round-robin games in that tournament. You can catch some of those highlights [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klPcg4P0m7w). That pass starting at 00:25 seconds is ridiculous.

Zegras possesses an uncanny knack for understanding space, creating it, and using it to his advantage. Misdirection is one of the most important weapons in his arsenal. Uses a variety of fakes, look offs, and changes of direction to distract opponents while putting sauce right on the tape of his linemates. Even on simple plays, he will throw in a small flourish – a change of pace, or a look-away, to freeze a defender for a half-second. He’s almost over-confident with the puck, as he’ll make behind-the-back passes, between his legs, no-look or try to saucer a pass through a half-dozen sticks when he sees an opening, and more often than not can put the puck into areas of the ice where only his teammates can reach it and turn it into a positive play. Very smart player who reads the defense instantly and finds a counter. Wizard-like hands are always in motion, and he’s equally good on his fore- or back-hand. Can dangle you to death with his incredible stick-handling.

One of the top skaters in the Class, he’s super quick and can explode out of a dead stop or changes in direction. He moves laterally with both ease and sharpness, and every stride seems designed to get him an advantage. Using his lateral mobility he can protect the puck by driving off defenders with speed or stepping around them. Will walk a defender to the outside, but Zegras prefers to threaten to go by a defender, get them on their heels, and then pull up to open up all kinds of space for himself to find a teammate. Thanks to his ridiculous handle and that skating, he can create clean zone entries at will. He’s particularly dangerous running the Power Play off the half-wall or at the point, with his NTDP coach pointing out that Zegras will be the best special teams player on whatever college team he goes to right out of the box (FYI – he’ll be at Boston University next season). High praise. You can check out some of his game (without Hughes) [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-jv-71HZLM).

A feature to his game he shares with Eichel is his ability to think the game at high speed. He recognizes openings and defenses even when skating full steam and has the presence of mind always try making a play rather than play it safe.

All that said, he’s still got some blemishes to his game. Some will claim his gaudy numbers are a result of playing with Jack Hughes, but he drove his own line for more than a few games this season with Hughes out for the [World Juniors](https://www.sbnation.com/world-junior-hockey) and Turcotte out with injury. You might be able to say that Hughes’ gaudy stats might not be so impressive without Zegras feeding him. So he doesn’t need to play with great players, but his playmaking ability is best employed when he’s skating with other talented offensive players who know where to be on the ice. He isn’t a pure goal scorer, and can tend to overpass, leaving good scoring opportunities on the table in favor of the extra pass. He’ll need to pick his spots better as the competition improves. Looking to shoot more often would help, but he doesn’t have a big shot. In fact, his clapper is rather pedestrian, and although he’s very accurate in picking spots, neither his wrist shot nor his release are exceptional. Yet there’s an that innate sense of where the puck is, and he can find it in a crowd and lift it in a second with those butter-soft hands of his.

Zegras is dogged on the puck, which makes him a very dangerous forechecker and very willing backchecker. That said, he needs some work when defending off the puck, where he can get too eager to blow the zone and loses his guy. In a way, his defensive game resembles [Jeff Skinner](https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/297073/jeff-skinner). As a very accomplished puck possession player, he’s still very slight (6’0, 170#), so he can get pushed around pretty easily by bigger D-Men and forwards on the wall, and all the slick moves in the world won’t help when you’re pinned against the boards. So he’ll need to bulk up.

Zegras is a true game breaker. To me, the only player who has a better pure skill/speed combination in this Draft is Jack Hughes.
