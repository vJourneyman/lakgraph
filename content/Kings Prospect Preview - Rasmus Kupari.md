## Summary
> In the fourth installment of the Los Angeles Kings prospect preview series, Iâ€™ll discuss Rasmus Kupari and his season ahead. The former 20th overall pick is heading into his sophomore season, looking to build upon an up-and-down rookie campaign.


## Notes and Quotes
- 2022
	- Took 3C from [[Gabe Vilardi]], but was inconsisten, leading to being sent to the Ontario Reign for a month.
	- Recalled and placed on a line with [[Quinton Byfield]] and Vilardi. Inconsistent, but exciting to watch line.
	- Line's ice time was cut as the season ended.
- 2023
	- Logjam at forward.
	- Waiver-exempt status puts him at a disadvantage to make the opening night roster.
	- If he starts in the AHL, he needs to dominate.
	- Comparable is [[Adrian Kempe]], though Kempe is heavier.
