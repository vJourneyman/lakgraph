## Summary
> The Dallas Stars welcome the Los Angeles Kings to the American Airlines Center tonight. It will be weird with Scott Wedgewood starting between the pipes tonight since Oettinger got injured.

There’s nothing the players can do about his injury now but to move forward with the season and win some games. Here are the three keys to the game if the Stars want to beat the Kings.
