## Notes and Quotes
### [[Trevor Moore]]
> I wanted to be here. I didn’t want to have to go anywhere else. So, it’s a good feeling to get it done. I just focus on hockey and winning games. Moore was aware the conversations were going on between his agent, Murray Koontz, and the team, but like most players, he avoided the highs and lows of becoming emotionally attached. You know it’s happening, so it’s kind of always there, but I’m just glad that’s behind me and I can start focusing more on hockey.

> There were a lot of times where I never thought I’d make it this far, and I have a great family that supports me. My wife, she’s put up with me through all my stresses, and it’s a good feeling, for sure.
