## Summary
> Rick Cummings (aka @ricktheyounger) has posted high-detail visuals of Forum Report playmaking charts on Twitter and now brings these data-optics to you, Forum Club. I’m proud to share he’ll fill the official Forum Report role as, according to Cletus, “the young’un what sorts them squiggles into words.” And by that, I mean he’ll present statistics more aesthetically than my thrice-weekly charts filled with digestible data that on a macro level the team values in its personnel. All yours, Rick!
