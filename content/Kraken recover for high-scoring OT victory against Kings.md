## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> It's a very, very confusing night for all of us. I'm really disappointed that we gave up nine goals, absolutely. But on the other side of the coin, I'm glad that we fought back, got a point, and scored eight. So it's mass confusion right now for all of us, and we better figure it out quickly.

### [[Adrian Kempe]]
> Obviously, weird game tonight. Not good enough in the D-zone, and the offense was really good. Could have gone either way.
