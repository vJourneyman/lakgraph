## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> We had guys miss line changes, passes through the neutral zone, we had an icing call with two seconds left.  Missed faceoff coverages. To me, I think that the physical part of the game was potentially there early, but the mental part didn’t exist at all.

> You could pick any one of the probably 20 moments during the game and eliminate it. It may give us a bigger chance, but we still weren’t good enough.

### [[Phillip Danault]]
> We lost the game in the first period. All the details and mistakes – that’s pretty much the game.
