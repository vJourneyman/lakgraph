## Summary
> Forum Report is very excited to bring you this feature, which will break simple possession statistics into a more nuanced understanding of who’s pushing the play towards the attacking net and how they’re doing it. It’s storytelling in chart form with some bullet points – a data-driven enhancement to what you saw the previous night. All statistics and commentary reflect the team’s five-on-five play.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
>  He went down to the American League and did his thing, but while he was there, a lot of our players at the National Hockey League level were asking about him, and that’s always a good sign, and to me that means he’s already earned the trust of the group and the coaching staff.

> That was not an easy game for us to play. As I said this morning, I didn’t know if this was going to be a road game or a home game. It felt like a road game driving down. Last season, they were 1-4-1.
