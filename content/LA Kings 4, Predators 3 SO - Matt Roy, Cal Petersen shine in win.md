## Notes and Quotes
> At the end of the night, \[[[Cal Petersen]]] had to make outstanding saves in overtime, and he was excellent in the shootout, and he’s won two games for us. So, for as much it’s been talked that he’s got to find his game, he’s won two twice, and that’s a real good thing. I think he started to settle in. -- [[Todd McLellan]]

> It’s not often that we’re talking about Matt scoring two to tie the game in the third period, but he has that ability. He’s got tremendous legs, he’s strong, he went to the net, and he knows the score, he can gamble a little bit more, and he did a real good job. Big night for him. -- [[Todd McLellan]]
