## Summary
> After being off since last Sunday in Arizona, the Ontario Reign return to action on Friday night for the first of a back-to-back weekend set vs. the Condors. Game one of the home-and-home games will be played in Bakersfield. Even though the two clubs have already played each other four times this season, only one of those contests came in Kern County; with the Condors skating to a 3-1 win there back in mid-November.
