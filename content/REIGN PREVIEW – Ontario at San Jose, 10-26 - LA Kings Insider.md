## Summary
> The Ontario Reign travel to San Jose and face the Barracuda for the first time this season Wednesday night at Tech CU Arena. It will also be the first time Ontario and San Jose battle at the newly opened home of the Barracuda. The Reign come into the matchup with a three-game winning streak after pulling off a sweep of the San Diego Gulls in a home-and-home series last weekend, while San Jose holds an unblemished 4-0-0 record on the season. A year ago during 2021-22, Ontario posted a 5-0-1 mark in six contests against the Cuda.
