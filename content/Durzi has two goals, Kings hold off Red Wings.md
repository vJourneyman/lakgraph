## Notes and Quotes
### [[Sean Durzi]]
> With the passers we got on this team, it's pretty surprising it's my first one. But a lot of great plays, got to credit my teammates.

### [[Carl Grundstrom]]
> Obviously, you want to be strong at home and play good in front of your fans, so I think it's a really big step in the right direction here now.

### [[Phillip Danault]]
> It's a hard game when you score right away, like you don't want your teammates to get flat and think it's going to be an easy game. Almost was good that they score back after and got us right back in the game, and we just kept playing our game for 60 minutes solid, so I'm really proud of our boys tonight.

> Sometimes just our finish we're missing, but obviously it was working tonight. We worked at it and stayed confident, and we believe in our group, and two big goals tonight on the power play.
