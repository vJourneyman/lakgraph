## Notes and Quotes
### [[Brandt Clarke]]
> I think this was a big step for us, this is a talented team. We kept the pedal to the metal for all 60 minutes this time.

> “I knew that I had a lot of time and space in the middle of the ice and that if Artie could get me the puck then we could make something happen.

### [[Phillip Danault]]
> We learned from our mistake right away, which is really good news.

### [[Gabe Vilardi]]
> Yeah, they’re a good team. They’ve been to the Cup final, whatever it is, three years in a row now. But I think we’re a good team, too, so we have to beat teams like this, especially on home ice.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> I can’t say enough about (Vilardi), he’s been outstanding since training camp. He has the tool kit to be playing (in the top six), he’s got a lot of confidence off the power play right now, he’s checking well, he’s using his body and as he leaves the rink everyday he’s really enjoying the game, and he’s earned it.

> I wasn’t here for all 10 \[losses in a row], so I just know we’ve had a tough time with them since I’ve been here.
