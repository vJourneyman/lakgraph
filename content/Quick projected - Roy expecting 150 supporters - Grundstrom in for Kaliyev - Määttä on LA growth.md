## Notes and Quotes
> “I think we were just good last year. We had that coming. The first year I was there, it was building, but last year, we took big steps. It was an exciting year for us. I don’t think it ended like we wanted it to – I think we had \[higher aspirations] and it seems like they just got better over the summer, so I’m sure they’ll be a good team. -- Olli Maatta

> In my mind, similar to Detroit’s third line, they keep a lot of plays alive. The goal that Vilardi scored, it was a dead play, but somehow [[Quinton Byfield]] got a stick on it, kept the play alive. Spending more time in the other team’s offensive zone, protecting pucks better. They work really hard to get it, and they’ll hold onto it and make good plays. Just don’t give it back to ‘em. -- [[Todd McLellan]]
