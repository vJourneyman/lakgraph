> Q: a couple days down and now at Reign Camp
uh how much have you gotten to kind of
start installing some things and and
teaching the guys a little bit of how
the Reign want to play this year 
> A: yeah no
we had some excellent practices this
week I thought the guy's been really
really good uh I think we we are getting
better every day
um yes we worked on a lot of things this
week uh system wise the way we want to
play and uh you know it was a lot of
information for the guys uh but you know
what they're doing really good so I'm
really pleased with uh with the effort
so far 

> Q: talked to Cameron gonez yesterday
and you know we were just talking about
the the talent level on this team what's
it been like for you to kind of see how
many elite players that the Reign roster
is going to have this year
> A: yeah we'll see uh I I think and I really
hope we're gonna have a really good
lineup and uh of course you want to see
a lot of young kids up with the Kings
but you know but also these guys will
help us on our team and uh no but you
know end of the day Talent alone it's
not going to win your hockey games and
uh I think and that's something we we
have to get better
um and that's where we're working on it
already
not \[just] being good with the puck
especially without the part 2 and yeah
that's an error we want to go around we
want to improve for sure 

> Q: what do you
think in a week like this you you just
have one preseason game what are some of
the keys that you as a staff try to to
get the guys to you know pay attention
to what are some of the things that you
highlight to them that are important on
a week like this 
> A: no I mean every day is
a different theme
um you know epidem is a different system
so the good thing is a lot of them
already had a chance to play uh
exhibition game over two or three with
the with the Kings so that helps
um during our week we try to even today
even if it's just a little scrimmage you
know just for a few minutes so try to to
get a game ready we do have uh only one
uh preseason game so it's not not as
easy but you know we as a coaching staff
we try to do our best to get these guys
ready and so they don't really have to
think when when it's game time so I
think we're we're in uh good shape now
and yeah hopefully for good results
then on Saturday 

> Q: for you guys as a
staff is it exciting this week I mean
what is it like kind of coming into this
week and being able to you were helping
out you're obviously on the ice during
the King's camp so you it's not the
first time on the ice with these guys
but to kind of have your meetings and
your plan and kind of go and have
practice run your way
> A: for me it's great because uh get to know
the guys uh yes I was not far away but
you know I never really worked on a
daily basis with these guys so it's been
really really helpful for me to be
around not just the coaching staff the
players to get to know and  know their
strength and weakness wickedness so so
it's good no it's uh it's exciting was a
really exciting week for me and I think
for everyone else in the locker room too
you know they all want to play it's been a
long summer it's been a long Camp
um you know including the king Camp so I
think everyone wants to wants to play
now
