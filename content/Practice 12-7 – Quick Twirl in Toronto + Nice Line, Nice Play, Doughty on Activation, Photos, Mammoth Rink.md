## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> They were strong, and again it wasn’t at the cost of anything going the other way. I thought they managed their shift length really well tonight. Vintage, I think, is probably a good way of putting it.

### [[Viktor Arvidsson]]
> Yeah, I think it was and it got better and better. I think we still have some things to come back to, but we took a step in the right direction.

### [[Trevor Moore]]
> I think we want to be a puck possession line and we’ve talked about it, we haven’t had enough puck possession. I think we’ve been building it these last two games, we’ve been winning more battles, coming up with more pucks and sustaining more o-zone time.

### [[Drew Doughty]]
> Yeah, I thought so. Copper had to come up with some big saves, but you have to expect that out of your goalies throughout a 60 minute game, that’s just how it goes, but we only gave up two and we were in control of that entire game. That’s how we want to play.

> I’m a guy that doesn’t play with a ton of risk. I take what the game gives me is I guess how you would say it. I do make some high-risk plays, don’t get me wrong and I try some things that other guys don’t, but for the most part, I’m not cheating, I’m not looking for offense. Last night, we’re up 4-1 in the first period and I didn’t look for offense the rest of the game. Maybe that’s a default of mine, maybe that’s why I’ve never had been point-a-game, but at the same time, I’m just worried about winning the hockey game, I’m not worried about points or cheating for offense, because I know how fast a team can give up a lead and lose a hockey game. My focus is not on offense when we’re up by that many goals, ever.
