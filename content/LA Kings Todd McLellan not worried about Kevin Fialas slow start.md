## Summary
> Naturally, when a team acquires a forward still entering their prime, the expectations will be enormous, especially giving up a first-rounder and then signing him to a lucrative contract extension. However, the LA Kings have yet to see Kevin Fiala hit the score sheet in his first two games – at least positively.


## Notes and Quotes
> I think he’s going to be a very effective player for us as time goes on. He’s adjusting to a new team. I think if you refer back to Phil Danault’s time early last year, it didn’t go easy. And I think we’re going to see more and more from Kevin. I don’t think we’ve seen his best yet. -- [[Todd McLellan]]
