## Summary
> After nearly a month-long training camp, the night is finally here — Opening Night of LA’s 2022-23 NHL season. For Game One, the Kings will skate in their white Heritage jerseys, along with their silver helmets. Rumor is, the visiting Golden Knights will counter with their gold helmets. We’ll see how things play out during warmups.
