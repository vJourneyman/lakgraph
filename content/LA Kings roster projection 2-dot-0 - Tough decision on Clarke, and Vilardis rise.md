## Summary
> The thing about a team confronting high expectations and having, as a goal, winning playoff round is that there’s less worry about who will fill out the lineup when the puck drops on opening night.

## Notes
> The best thing that I can tell you again is that there’s a group that we’re really happy with. There’s a group – a lot of them aren’t here anymore – there’s still a few that aren’t quite going to get it done. And that’s just the way it is. Not everybody can play.
> Our big concern is that middle group and what are they going to do and when are they going to do it. We’ve got three or four days left here before we’ve got to play that team again. Obviously both clubs are going to get better. They’re going to put different players in the lineup. We’ve given up 10 goals in the last six periods we’ve played. That’s not who we are and that’s not how we should be playing.
> I know they’re better than that. And that’s why we’re waiting for them. They’ve got to make these decisions now instead of seven, eight, 10 games into the season and they realize it’s a little bit too late. -- [[Todd McLellan]]

- [[Brandt Clarke]] is making it difficult for the Kings to send him back to the OHL.

> When I came in, my intentions were to stick around as long as possible, to kind of open a couple people’s eyes on my play and my style. And I think that’s what I’ve been doing. I’m really happy with how I’ve been playing. I’m really happy with the atmosphere around here. Everyone is so welcoming and I’m really happy to be here. I want to stay as long as I can. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]

- [[Sean Durzi]] made his preseason debut at the last preseason game after completing his return from off-seasons shoulder surgery. 

> I thought he did some good things on one side of the puck and others that he has to sharpen up. -- [[Todd McLellan]]

> It’s kind of back to the drawing board. Make my reads quicker. Watch the tape and learn. Quite honestly, it’s three periods left in the preseason. Go in tomorrow, regrouping. Looking at what I can do better, which is a lot. I think there’s a lot more I can do and a lot I can fix in my game, quite honestly. It’s going back, learning from it and quite honestly just executing.
> You want to do it right away. Season’s coming up and I think I’m capable. Obviously, that’s what I’m going to do. -- [[Sean Durzi]]
