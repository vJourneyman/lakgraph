## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> It’s hard to beat penalty kills when they’re in position. You look at the goal that we gave up tonight. We’re just out of position a little bit. But it comes off a scramble play, a retrieval. And that’s a big part of a power play.
> (Assistant coach) Jimmy Hiller’s been doing some really good things with our power play. The tree’s starting to bear some fruit, if you will. Guys have to continue. But unless there’s a real strong work ethic on it, it doesn’t matter who you bring in or what he’s trying to do with the group. Our power play’s had some good work ethic lately and it’s getting rewarded.

> Teams that have that element of a shot from there that can score from distance or just power it by a goaltender, you have to respect it. And it can open up space for other players. If you don’t have it, they can cheat. You don’t have to worry so much about that side.
> I think you only have to look at No. 8 in Washington to see how that works. I’m not saying that Arthur is Ovechkin by no means. Maybe later on in his career he’ll get there. They both have that element of a shot from that spot. Obviously different hands and you have to respect it. It opens up ice for others.

> It can be argued on any given night which is (unit) one and which is two. The way we have it structured right now, the guys that are rested are usually the ones that are starting. It’s traditionally just ‘OK, Kopi let’s go and you can be exhausted.’ We feel like we’ve been able to put two units together where (it’s), ‘OK, Kopi, you guys are tired. Drew, you’ve been out a lot. Let’s get a breather and put the other unit out.’ Or vice versa.
> I think that’s allowed us to start fresher than maybe we have in the past.

> You don’t get on the power play unless you draw that penalty. And it can happen in many different ways. Sometimes, it’s just accidental. The other team does something that they’re not intending to (do). Or else you’re working real hard and you’re attacking the net and they’ve got to pull you down.
> Between the first and second, we had to have a little talk about how we were playing. We had to change our game. It wasn’t working. And I thought we adapted. We took it up a notch in the second. Certainly, a notch again into the third. Got into overtime. The power play obviously played a big role in getting us there.



### [[Adrian Kempe]]
> He’s great. In that spot, he’s starting to figure out where he needs to be wherever the puck is on that unit. Arvy and Phil and Mooresy are unbelievable in getting the puck back and finding his backdoor.
> When you have a guy like that sitting in the quiet area, you try to get the puck over there. He got two goals tonight and it was big for him and for the team.

### [[Viktor Arvidsson]]
> We’re just trying to play. Find the open guy and move the puck quick and attack. I think we’re doing a good job.
