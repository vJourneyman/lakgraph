## Summary
> It’s rare to hear players and coaches admit to fatigue after a game as not to espouse an excuse or shirk responsibility. But after the Kings played their league-leading 21st game, and tied for the league lead with their 12th road game, their acknowledgement that three long trips through the first five weeks of the season had taken their toll became more tacit.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Anze Kopitar]]
> I thought we played a decent game. I wouldn’t say a ‘good game,’ but a decent game tonight. Petey was really good in net. We punched it in OT. Sometimes back-to-backs are hard, and we didn’t get too much rest, so we’ll take the point.

> They play aggressively. They play with a lot of energy and they don’t give you a lot of space to work with. Every foot on the ice or every inch of space, it’s well-earned and hard-fought.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> There are other teams that are 10 days behind us. They’ll get it at some point, and if we happen to be playing, then we need to take advantage of it.
> To get a point in this situation was good for us. I thought we really had to dig in to get that point. We’ll rest tomorrow, and then we’ll get ready for another tough week.

> If \[[[Sean Durzi]]]’s day-to-day, we think we’ll have him next game. Now, we don’t know how he’s going to feel tomorrow, but we don’t think his injury is major.

> We got exactly what we thought we would get \[from [[Jacob Moverare]]]. Same simple plays, well defended, blocking shots. Kind of nice to have a lefty and a righty on all the pairs tonight, so he gave us what we needed. He was well prepared and ready to go.

> Well, \[[[Gabe Vilardi]]]’s leading us with 10 goals, so yeah, of course. They know who he is and they’re going to play him tighter and harder, and when you’re playing him with Kopi you’re facing the top pair, and then you’re facing the second pair if they double team you. It’s not an easy job, and that’s a part of growing up in the league. He’s made tremendous strides. He’s going to continue to be a real good player for us. Sometimes we have to help him and get him away from that a little bit too. He played real well with Lizzo and Arvy, and he’s going to be a real good player for us tomorrow and the next day and the next few years.

> It was a really hard, heavy game for both teams. Evenly played. We made the last mistake, they capitalized on it. To come up with a point in the back to back game, especially coming from behind, we’ll take that. It was a hard night.

### [[Jaret Anderson-Dolan]]
> \[Seattle]’s beautiful. You see every part of it. Spent a little time of the summer here as well, so we got to see it quite a bit. A lot of time on the bus just in your thoughts, looking at the sights and all that, so definitely good memories of that.

> Yeah, I think it’s coming along. I think I can take another step. I need to contribute offensively to help the team win, but I feel like I’m doing the little things pretty well, so I’ve just got to take the next step.

### [[Cal Petersen]]
> Just trying to make the save when I can – the opportune save. That’s a hard team that we’re playing against over there. They play us hard, so they’re going to force us to make mistakes too, so it’s just being back there and helping to support them when I can.

> They grind you along the boards really well and try to find guys in open holes. Kind of similar to how we like to play in the offensive zone, so it makes it tough. It’s tough when they’re very opportunistic. We play a pretty similar game, so we should be used to grinding along, and I think we did a decent job of that tonight.
