## Summary
> In some ways, it’s only appropriate that the Kings and Flames produced a 6-5 game on Monday night in Calgary. After many years of coach Darryl Sutter referring to the NHL as a 3-2 league, hockey’s new reality was on full display. While defense still wins championships, regular season offense has been up for quite some time and this game provided yet another example.
