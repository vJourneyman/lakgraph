## Summary
> _Because we all love goals, I thought it would be a good idea for a deep dive into Tuesday’s National ~~Lacrosse League~~ Hockey League game. But I didn’t want to do it. So I reached out to Forum Club contributor Sean Shapiro, whose [Slap Shots substack](https://seanshapiro.substack.com/) features Why did that go in?, an excellent illustration of the dangles and oopsies that lead to NHL goals, and sadistically asked if he’d like to columnize Tuesday’s spectacle. All yours, Sean!_
