## Notes and Quotes
### [[Cal Petersen]]
> The guys battled tremendously for me, which was awesome. It’s cool to see them, and a lot of guys I’m meeting for the first time and they’re willing to lay their bodies down for me and block some shots. So that was awesome to see. It was a great team win. Being down a man at the end, getting some huge blocks, a bunch of sacrifice. It was really, really cool.

> It’s different, it’s an adjustment. But I’m going to make it the best thing for me at the time right now. \[I know] where I want to be, and this is the route to get there. That’s the way I’m going to look at it.

> It was a bit of a shock, a bit of an adjustment, but it’s a reality. All you need is a net to showcase yourself and to show who you are and who you can be. So, I’m very fortunate to have an opportunity to come down here and play. They have great fans and it’s a building I know well, so it’s going to be a great opportunity.

> I’ll kind of keep what was said between \[me and GM [[Rob Blake]]] between us. But the fact of the matter is, he felt that this was the route for me to get back to where I want to be in the NHL. It’s a harsh reality, but it’s the reality of it. So, that’s how I’m going to look at it. This is a great opportunity to be able to play consistent games. That’s something that I felt like I’ve needed, and this is going to be a great opportunity to get a lot of game reps. The next time I get the opportunity go up there and play, I’ll be better.

> It’s a hard answer. I’m obviously the harshest critic of my game. I have a great team around me that cares about me deeply. I know where I can be. I feel like I can be a starter in the \[NHL] and one the best goaltenders in the league. That belief hasn’t been shaken. I don’t think you ever really know the road that your hockey career, your pro career, is going to take you. It’s been a crazy ride just to get to this point. If a little detour is what’s around the bend, that’s what the universe has in store for me. That’s how I’m going to approach it. I know what I can do, and I know who I am. But right now, it’s a day-by-day process to get better and it goes through Ontario.

> Honestly, too many to count. Guys I haven’t spoken to in a long time \[called and sent text messages]. A lot of friends did. That was really supportive. I had a lot of people that were in my corner, even a few people I haven’t even met. To see them, and to see them recognize how this is a hard situation, and that they have my back and wish the best for me is the reason I was able to come out here and have a good game and hopefully carry this forward and then hopefully get to where I want to be.
