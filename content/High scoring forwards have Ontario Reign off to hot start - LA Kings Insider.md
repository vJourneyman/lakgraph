- [[T.J. Tynan]]


## Staff
- [[Marco Sturm]]


## Notes and Quotes
- [[Samuel Fagemo]]
  > He was pretty good. I thought him and Tynan had a really good game. With his shot, he’s so dangerous at five-on-five and five-on-four. Now, we have to find a way to get him even more shots like that. -- [[Marco Sturm]]
  
  > “It feels better and better each game here. It’s such an honor to play with those guys, I’m just trying to do my best and shoot the puck and be at the right places at the right times. -- [[Samuel Fagemo]]
  
  > I think I’m playing big minutes right now. It feels good out there and I’m just trying to improve in that area too. I think I can be even better at it. -- [[Samuel Fagemo]]
  
  > He’s not really tall, not really big, so I think he needs to get a little bit stronger and play like a big guy. He has the shot, I think he has the hands for it, now we just need to make sure that he gets stronger and get maybe on a faster pace to play in the NHL. Sometimes it takes a little bit of time, but we try to work with him every day because he has something. So we just try to get his engine going and maybe get him to the next level. -- [[Marco Sturm]]
- [[Rasmus Kupari]]
- [[Lias Andersson]]
  > We had him with the Kings too and when he played on the power play, he was the net-front guy because we already saw that that’s a good spot for him. He’s very skilled, but he’s not afraid to go to the dirty areas so he deserved that rebound goal and that shows what kind of player he is. -- [[Marco Sturm]]
- [[T.J. Tynan]]
  > He’s our best player. On a lot of teams, the best players are the team captain. We named him as the captain because we believe in him. He also has to grow and learn how to be a captain as well, and he’s up for the challenge. He’s working on it every day and that’s what we like. Guys love him, he brings a lot to the team and guys will stick up for him. -- [[Marco Sturm]]
  
  > For the size he has and even the weight, I think he plays like a big man. If you’re the MVP for two years in a row, that shows you something. We are really happy to have him and I’m happy for him to have the chance to be the team captain for an organization. It’s the first time for him but he deserved it for sure. -- [[Marco Sturm]]
  
  > They’re amazing players and it’s good to see \[ [[Lias Andersson]] and [[Samuel Fagemo]]] get on the board early. For me, it’s just about using my skill set to try to get them pucks where they’re comfortable and where they like it. You get Lias the puck around the net and good things are going to happen. I actually missed Sammy a couple of times today, but if you can get him some pucks, he’s got a heck of a shot. Hopefully we get better and better each day. -- [[T.J. Tynan]]
