## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> It’s taxing at the beginning of the year, you’re not used to the games coming quickly and spending eight or nine days on the road, but that’s certainly not an excuse for giving up – what have we given up? – 23, on the road. If we left L.A. last Friday and somebody would have told me we would score 20 goals on this road trip, I’d be pretty darn excited about winning a lot of games.

### [[Viktor Arvidsson]]
> I’m more comfortable with the puck, making plays, and we’re starting to get our groove back: me, Phil and Mooresy. We’re starting to feel better.
