## Notes and Quotes
### [[Cal Petersen]]
> It’s tough. These are the hardest games. When there’s not a ton of rhythm. There’s a lot of penalties. You’re trying to get yourself in it. It’s the first game of the season, too. I think there’s a lot of kinks that I’m trying to get out and the team’s trying to get out.

> Hopefully never have to win one like that again.

> It was a little bit challenging. You want to start out with camp right away. I had a really good summer, and I was really looking forward to kind of building that into camp. Getting a little injured was a little bit of a setback and you kind of feel like you’re having to play catch-up. Luckily it was minor. The thing with the season is you try and build into it as much as you can. Try and play your best hockey at the end of it.
> 
> It’s more so just taking your time with the process, realizing you’re not going to be perfect right away and try and get better every day.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> If we look at his preseason, he goes to San Jose and plays the first period basically and then he’s out for a week. Eight or night days. Doesn’t feel the puck. Comes back into it and it’s not an easy task. For me, goaltending’s a lot like pitching. It’s tough to find your Cy Young winner in April. You usually find him in September and October. And goaltending around the league is probably like that. It’s finding its way.
> 
> We have to help our goaltenders as much as we can. We haven’t been as tight as we’ve been. We haven’t broken out as clean (from our end). The penalty parade puts a lot of pressure on them.

> Probably both teams were thinking the same thing. Get us a save and we’ll get you a goal. Obviously, that was the way the night was going. We did give up six. I’m not sure that we can pin them all on Cal Petersen.
> 
> What’s important for him is he got a win. He’s got some confidence as far as winning goes. And the team got that but it’s pretty evident we have to clean some things up.
