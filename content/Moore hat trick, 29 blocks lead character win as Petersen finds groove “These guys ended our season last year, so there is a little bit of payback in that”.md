## Notes and Quotes
### [[Trevor Moore]]
> It was just funny. It’s kind of like I was fighting the puck stickhandling a little bit a couple times out there. Phil was just like, ‘just shoot it, all right?'

> \[[[Viktor Arvidsson]]]’s just an all-around super smart hockey player. He can score when he needs to and he can make plays when he needs to – he’s shown that.

> I was just late into the zone, and I saw \[[[Matt Roy]]] go down the back side. Phil just made a good, hardworking battle to get me the puck and I shot it.

### [[Matt Roy]]
> I started coming back up the ice, I saw Mooresy open up for a one-timer. The shot was too hard for me to see it.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> When they’re doing that, everybody seems to do it.

> We went from shoddy … to committed. It looked different, it felt different.

> It was a broken play, really. Connor had lost it, goalie came out for a poke check, connor whacked it. That’s why you don’t quite coming back, you never know what can happen. But good for \[[[Viktor Arvidsson]]] – it was his first experience with our team playing in that type of atmosphere against that team, and I think it was good for him to be involved in it.

### [[Cal Petersen]]
> First, we kept them off the power play, and that’s their bread and butter – that’s where they get all their momentum. And secondarily, we kept them from getting pucks to the net. The amount of blocked shots the guys had tonight, I don’t think I’ve ever seen that in front of me before in my career here, so that was extremely impressive and such a good indicator of the character guys that we have in our locker room.

> At the end of the day, these guys ended our season last year, so there is a little bit of payback in that. Again, we play this team as hard as any team, so it’s probably one of our best rivalries right now. We don’t really like anybody on that team, and I don’t think they like any of us, so it makes for a great game and it’s easy to get up for.

### Connor McDavid
> That’s the game they want to play. We knew that. They want to sit back and just be above guys all the time, and there’s nothing new. They didn’t come out and surprise us with anything. Sometimes that’s just the way the game script goes. It just went exactly how they like it.
