## Summary
> Saturday night brought the Kings first regulation loss of their just-completed homestand. Two overtime losses, plus a win over Arizona, allowed LA to scoop up four of the possible eight points that were at stake. However, that’s not good enough; they’ll need to be better over the next six games to keep pace in the Pacific Division.
