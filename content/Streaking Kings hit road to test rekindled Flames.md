## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> We haven’t given up much at 5-on-5, which we’re happy about. A few things to clean up, but good teams play with detail all the time, over and over again, they don’t let it slip. That’s what we’re pushing to be.

> \[[[Sean Durzi]]]’s learning, or maybe he’s learned already, when those pressure points come and how to react to them. If you haven’t played on your off side, that’s all brand new and some of the situations he’s been caught in, you don’t see him caught in those spots as much anymore. Repetition, practice and playing, he’s doing a really good job.

> These guys won championships because they sacrificed, they gave up offense, they did what other teams didn’t want to do in the past and we still have some of that room. Drew, Quickie and Kopi, they have to give and give so that the team can win, and they did that in the past and we want them to keep doing that.
