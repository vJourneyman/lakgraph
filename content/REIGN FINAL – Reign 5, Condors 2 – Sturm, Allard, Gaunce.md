## Notes and Quotes
### [[Marco Sturm]]
> For some reason, we always have trouble against them, but we’ll take that win today. We had some good moments and some no-so-good moments, and those are things we just have to try to fix and try to make better. I think we know we can play better. It’s just a mindset for me, and I know the guys can do it. There are some nights where we have some boring moments too, but you’ve got to stay focused, stay hungry, and play to your potential for 60 minutes. We’re just not doing it yet.

> \[[[Cal Petersen]]] is a professional. He got sent down, and he’s still the same Cal I knew with the Kings. That shows a lot. That shows the kind of person he is. I’ve been around him the last three or four years and now seeing him here for just four days, he’s exactly the same. He’s focusing on playing and getting his game back, and that’s exactly what he does. We’re very fortunate and we’re lucky to have him right now in our room.

> I think when you get a 10-minute \[misconduct], I think we can control it. There were some bad calls, but it goes both ways. That’s what I notice in this league. It’s different \[than the NHL]. There will always be a lot of penalties for both sides and we just have to deal with it. But the 10 minute \[penalties] are on us.

### [[Frederic Allard]]
> I think we’ve just played as a team, even when the team goes out, we just stick together and stuck to our structure all game long. It wasn’t pretty at the start. Cal was unreal both games this weekend and helped us win. I think he came down with a great attitude and it showed in those two games. He made some big saves when it was time, and he gave us some confidence.

> It’s good. \[[[Tobie Bisson]] and I] have great chemistry. I think you can see it on the ice every game we’ve played together. It’s been good that we can talk in French. I know the language barrier can sometimes make it a little bit easier. We travel together and we hang out together, so the chemistry is unreal. I love playing with him. He makes the game way easier for me. I feel like we’re two d-men who are completely different. He’s a big, more stay-at-home \[defenseman], he can move the puck to the corner and gets hit. I’m more of the moving puck \[player] of the unit, so I move the puck and see the ice pretty well. He does too, but we just complement each other. He’s hard to play against. I think having two different styles make us a good pair.

> I felt good. I wanted it and felt it. \[[[Samuel Helenius]]] had a big faceoff win there and I just teed it up and got lucky when it went in. I’m happy about it. Big props to Big Sammy for that faceoff win.
