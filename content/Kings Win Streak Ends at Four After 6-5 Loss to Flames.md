## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> You start getting a little desperate and it starts going your way, but it's too little too late. You can pick any one of the, probably, 20 moments during the game and eliminate it and it might give us a better chance but we still weren't good enough.

> It's good, we didn't roll over we didn't quit. But the fact that we were in that situation was pretty unique. We were a shot away from at least getting a point, the goaltender made a really good save. But again, I don't think we should lose sight of how this game evolved just because we clawed back and made it six-five. There's a lot of things we have to fix.
