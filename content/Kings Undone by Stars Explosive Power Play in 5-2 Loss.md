## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Put it this way, the start wasn't what we wanted. If you don't have your legs, you better have your brains, and we had neither. And that makes it a really tough night, and that leads to penalties. The penalty kill didn't get it done. We had it on our tape numerous times and didn't get it out. With that kind of firepower and powerplay, it's going to end up in your net.

> The three goals, bang, bang, bang, really put a dagger in us.

> Well, we decided to go 11 and 7. We wanted to play that. We wanted to get Clarkie into a game and thought it would be a good idea.

> You have to give Dallas credit. They knew we were playing back-to-back, I'm sure they weren't happy with their performance, but they really skated well. They were much quicker and much cleaner than we were. They forced us to play long and waste a lot of energy chasing them all over the place.

### [[Phillip Danault]]
> It definitely got us in trouble right away. We can't do that because we knew they were fresh, they had two days off, and we have to be better and more careful with that. Yeah, they cost us the game.

### [[Anze Kopitar]]
> Yeah, it kills the flow of the bench and the game. We gave up three PK goals today, and that's certainly not going to cut it.
