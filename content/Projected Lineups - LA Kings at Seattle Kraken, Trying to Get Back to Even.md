## Summary
> With a 1-2 record on their current road trip, the Kings will now look to draw even in Seattle on Saturday night – and it won’t be easy. Just last month, the Kraken handed coach Todd McLellan’s club one of the most embarrassing losses of the young season. And the second-year NHL franchise has only gained confidence since then. The Kraken enter tonight with a better points percentage than the Kings and a goal differential that is more than 10 goals in their favor, with three fewer games played.
