## Summary
> Kings defenseman Brandt Clarke knew his solo lap was coming from the moment he learned he would play his first NHL game and started letting his family and friends know. It is the lap in which teammates send that player out to the ice first and all alone for the warm-up skate before they join him.


## Notes and Quotes
> I had put on my jersey, and I was reaching up for my gear. My gloves were up there (on a shelf) and the guys were yelling across the room, ‘Don’t even think about it. Don’t even try.’ I didn’t put it on.  -- [[Brandt Clarke]]

> I just felt like it took forever to be honest with you. Probably to you guys, it’s like 10 seconds. To me, it felt like five minutes. I was just out there with all those eyes on me. I think I didn’t stop smiling for like five minutes into warm-up.
> It was a good feeling. I saw my parents right away. I looked up to where they were sitting. They were there with smiles on their faces and their phone out and stuff like that. It’s a moment I’ll never forget.  -- [[Brandt Clarke]]

> There’s enough that’s going on in their world right now. First game. Family in town. We don’t want to overburden him with details. We want him to play the game. We want him to enjoy the process. I think the less he has on his mind and more instinctual hockey, the better chance he has for success.
> We haven’t sat with him and gone through everything and what to expect and what not to expect. If he comes to us, we’ll certainly help him. But we’ll leave him alone.  -- [[Todd McLellan]]

> This is the moment I have dreamt of for so long. I’ve been watching the NHL for my entire life and now that I’m officially going to be in it, it’s kind of crazy to think. This is going to be something I never forget. It’s pretty cool.  -- [[Brandt Clarke]]

> He’s fine penalty-killing. -- [[Todd McLellan]]

> We’re shorthanded for four of the first 6 1/2 minutes of the game,. Once we settled in, that allowed Brandt to play a little bit more.  -- [[Todd McLellan]]

> Definitely first couple of shifts, the puck was on my stick too long. Every time I turned, there was one of their offensive players coming to lay a body check on me. It as definitely a wake-up call right away. The puck’s got to move quick. Got to know where everyone is on the ice. I think I adapted pretty well throughout the game, and it was crisper later in the game. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]

> I came into the room, and I was like, ‘Wow'. Every time I had the puck, no one brushed by me or anything (and) you’re not getting laid out but they’re finishing on you. It’s just something you got to get adjusted to as well. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]

> It was a good feeling. To be relied on in that situation. That’s what they wanted. They wanted a spark of offense, and they trusted it in our hands. We tried and made some good plays at the blue line. Drew’s obviously Drew. He’s smart with the puck and got shots through. I’m just trying to make some play to get the puck in his hands. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]

> We dressed six defensemen tonight. I know he wasn’t (a) 6. Pretty sure he wasn’t 5. And I don’t believe he was 4 either. That’s what I thought of him. I thought he had a real good night.
> Didn’t hurt us at all defensively. Creative offensively. I’d like to see him shoot the puck a little bit because I think he’s got a great shot. Loves to pass but he had some real good looks at the net where he could have shot the puck. -- [[Todd McLellan]]

> I thought my third period was my best period. Personally, you don’t want to say your happy because we lost and it leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. But I’m definitely happy that I got that first one out of the way and I’m just going to try to keep progressing from here. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]
