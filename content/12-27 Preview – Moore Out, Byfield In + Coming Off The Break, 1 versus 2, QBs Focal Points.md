## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> When we look back at our history, we’ve had some really good returns and we’ve had some ugly returns.

> I think if we can get everybody playing quickly, the last thing we need to do is be shorthanded for four of the first six minutes or something like that, get everybody involved in the game. It’s probably a common theme around the league for coaching staffs, simplify your game and execute. Really, the team that that finds it the quickest is often the winner, so that will be our goal.

> In reference to the first game of the season, we weren’t very good against Vegas. We still had an opportunity to get a point, we didn’t do that, we probably got what we deserved. Coming out of the Christmas break, it’ll be about getting the team going again a little bit. and up and running, but they’ll think the same way. It’s our last opportunity on home ice to play them. There are a lot of reasons, over and above just the standings, to get our game together.

> He had some really good nights, in talking to \[[[Marco Sturm]]], there was still a push for consistency, night in and night out, and that’s the same for any young player really, that’s what you’re pushing for. Right now, with the injuries that we have and the positional needs, he’s the recall that we chose and he’s likely best suited for that recall. Now, we want him to come and play with confidence, he knows how to do it on both sides of the puck and have an impact.

### [[Brendan Lemieux]]
> Now that we got the break over with – just what I needed another three days off – it’s good to be back with the group. I’m excited to get into some nitty gritty, this is that grind time of the year. It’s everybody’s least favorite stretch, so I’m excited to have some energy for it.

### [[Sean Durzi]]
> It’s the first game after the break, it’ll be the first team who can find it quicker. I think we have a good enough group in here that we can use our leadership and our mentality, play our game and focus on what we do well to attack them.

> You always want to get to the top and the only way to get there is to beat them.

### [[Adrian Kempe]]
> I feel like it’s become more of a rivalry with Vegas over the years, it’s always a tight game. Going back to last year, we had some good games against them and we’re hungry for a win here. Obviously we lost our first game at home this season against them and we’re excited to play them again. Usually there’s a good crowd for this game and a good hockey game.

### [[Quinton Byfield]]
> Right now, I’m just focused on playing my game. You want to just do your job, there’s obviously a role that you have to play, but you want to be the player that you’ve always been. I’m just going to go in and try and do that.

> I \[worked on] the defensive end, I was playing a lot of PK time, doing a lot of faceoffs and working on that area. Those were the two big things and offensively, I was working on getting points again and getting that going again.
