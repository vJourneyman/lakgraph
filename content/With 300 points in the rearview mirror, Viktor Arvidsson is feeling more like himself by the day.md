## Summary
> On Monday evening in Calgary, Kevin Fiala became the eighth member of the 2014 NHL Draft class to reach 300 career points. Two days later in Edmonton, his teammate Viktor Arvidsson became the ninth to do so, as he collected assists on all three Kings goals in a 3-1 victory over Edmonton.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> \[[[Viktor Arvidsson]]] only played in the last exhibition, right, he didn’t have any of the black and white scrimmages, he didn’t have any the first exhibition games, so there’s basically nine opportunities to play that didn’t happen. As he’s reached Game 15 or 16 now, it’s taken some time, but he’s doing some really good things right now and we need him to keep doing that.

> I think he completes that pair and he does play a little differently, yet he fits the recipe of the line. The one thing he’s not afraid to do shoot the puck, he gets it and he shoots it, it’s just a given and the other two can play off of his shot a lot of times. I think that’s a really good thing for that line, that direct style, the other two get pucks back so they can complement each other.

### [[Viktor Arvidsson]]
> I feel good, I’m getting there, I’m for sure a little bit behind from the summer. I hadn’t really gotten to work out that much, I was sitting still a lot for four months I was just doing the rehab, so I’m trying to get back on track. I feel like I’m slowly getting there, some days are better and some days are not there but it’s getting better for sure.

> I feel like on the ice, I’m fine and I’m mentally making plays and I’ve been playing for so long and that comes back to you really quickly. Getting physically ready took a little bit longer, it’s going to take a little bit, but hopefully it just gets better and better.

### [[Trevor Moore]]
> \[[[Viktor Arvidsson]]]’s an incredible player, he works super hard and has all the talent in the world. I think that me and Phil maybe play a little bit more straight line and then Arvy brings that offensive flair, that he’s so good at. It’s huge for us.

> \[[[Viktor Arvidsson]]]’s just an all-around, super smart hockey player. I think he can score when he needs to and he can make plays when he needs to, he’s shown that. I think it was his 300th point tonight, I mean, the guy is just a great hockey player and I’m fortunate to play with him.

### [[Phillip Danault]]
> Yeah, you need to have a little bit riskier of a player offensively who will try something, a toe drag, opening up and creating some offense. It’s huge, big time and I think every good line in the NHL is like that. You need some risk from time to time and obviously Arvy isn’t too risky, he has a very good hockey IQ and he’s good defensively as well. It’s been going well.
