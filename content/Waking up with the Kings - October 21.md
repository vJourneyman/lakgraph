## Summary
> Own the first period, dominate possession, generate long in-zone shifts, allow three goals, load up the bus. It didnâ€™t matter where below the dots the LA Kings opened their gelato stand in their 6-1 loss at Pittsburgh Thursday night. Winning the xGF battle from start to finish meant nothing.
