## Notes and Quotes
### [[Phillip Danault]]
> It was awesome to see some huge saves on both sides and that Quickie got the best out of it in this game. He was solid for us and the shutout was well-deserved for him.
> (Fleury) is a great goalie. He’s still kicking, he works hard and he’s never beat.

> Gabe has been tremendous for us this year in every aspect.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> The adjustment between the second and third (periods) mentally was really important for our team. Obviously, it didn’t go well on the power play, we were all a little bit frustrated. The break came, we reloaded and, for the last three weeks, we’ve talked about ‘Can we win a game two-one or one-nothing?’ We found a way to do it.
