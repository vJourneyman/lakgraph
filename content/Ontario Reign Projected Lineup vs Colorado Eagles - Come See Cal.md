## Summary
> [[Cal Petersen]] has arrived in Ontario and is ready to begin the next chapter of his journey. He last played for the Reign in January 2020. Yet, it’s been even longer since he squared off with the Colorado Eagles — that came in November 2019, when he shut them out 4-0 and earned first star of the game honors.
