## Summary
> The Los Angeles Kings‘ draft history has been solid. They’ve had some big misses in the past, but overall have been consistent with their ability to draft. Where they’ve been less successful is trading away their draft picks. It’s always a risk in trading away talent, and the Kings haven’t always found success when rolling the dice.
