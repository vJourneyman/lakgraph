## Summary
> The LA Kings tuned up several important parts of their operation in a performance that improved as 60 minutes elapsed and represented the game-over-game response anyone in hockey operations would want to see after the bad taste left over from the Winnipeg game, limiting one of the league’s premier offensive teams to just one five-on-five goal. It was a team victory meshing goaltending, checking, performances by top players, and importantly special teams.


## Players

- [[Gabe Vilardi]]
- [[Phillip Danault]]

## Notes and Quotes

> We’d like \[[[Rasmus Kupari]]] to have some offensive pop as well, but his job is to check and he does a really good job of that.
