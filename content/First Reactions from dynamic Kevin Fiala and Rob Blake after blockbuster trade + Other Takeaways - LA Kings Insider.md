## Notes and Quotes
### [[Rob Blake]]
> I think we understood a need for scoring, dynamic scoring, playmaking ability, puck possession, a lot of the different traits and attributes that Kevin possesses. We had identified a need during the season and there aren’t a lot of times players like that come available. We were fortunate enough to be able to get in, get a deal done and get Kevin with us.

> We knew we had an opportunity to get a player of Kevin’s caliber and that goes to the forefront right away. We were going to make sure we got that in place and that would be the biggest improvement to our team.

### [[Kevin Fiala]]
> In the season, you don’t think about it, you just play hockey, but in the back of your head, you’re kind of wondering what’s going to happen. I didn’t really let it bother me in the season, I just tried to have fun with the guys and just tried to win some games. That was my main focus.

> I had a big goal at the beginning of the season and I thought it was important to take the next step and be an all-around player, play better defensively, play some PK minutes and offensively, I had a great season with points and stuff. I don’t know \[what was different] but it went pretty well. I think I focused on shooting a little bit more, even from bad angles, just getting to the netfront on some tips. I thought I got better and better as the season went on. I think if I’m at my best, I’m around the net a lot so that was the key to the success this season.

> I think I am a skilled player, an offensive guy, but I like to be in the corners and when I’m at my best, I’m using my body and creating well. I’m not a huge hitter or anything like that, but if there’s a good hit to be made I’ll make it, otherwise I feel like I’m an offensive guy, but also getting stronger and stronger defensively.

> You never know with who you might play, that’s a long way to go, but those two are great players. Kopitar has been in the league for a long, long time, he’s won Stanley Cup, he’s done it all and Kempe had an unbelievable year last year, he’s rising. I’m very excited if I do get a chance with those two guys and we go from there.

> This is just a great opportunity and a great organization. I see the team coming up, made the playoffs last year and they have a great group of guys I’ve heard and on the ice they’re just getting better and better. There are some great young players coming up and the future is bright, I felt like. I’m very happy with this.
