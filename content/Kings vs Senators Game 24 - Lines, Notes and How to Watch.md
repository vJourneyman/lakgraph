## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Consistency. Can we establish our game, how long does it take for us to establish our game? And then can we maintain our game? A lot of things go into that. The game in San Jose, I thought we had a good game there because we really felt good about playing all four lines. We weren't hemmed in by any one line. It didn't rise and then fall and rise and fall. It was pretty even-keeled, so that's part of building on our win. And we want to see that consistently night after night.

> \[[[Rasmus Kupari]]]'s line was excellent. I said after the game, I thought that was their best game. Obviously, they haven't been together all year, but when they are together or as pieces coming together, that was their best game of the season. I felt really good about their game, they did a lot of necessary things to have success. Blocking shots, there was physicality on the forecheck, won stick battles two sticks over top of the puck. Getting body positioning, they won those. Got on the score sheet. All of the things you need to have a good night, they did.
