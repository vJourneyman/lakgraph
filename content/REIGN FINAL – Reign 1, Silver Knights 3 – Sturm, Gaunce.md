## Notes and Quotes
### [[Marco Sturm]]
> I don’t know if ‘stick with it’ are the right words for it, I think we still have too many passengers and I think we should’ve been way better today and we weren’t. At the end of the day, special teams was probably the difference but even the 5-on-5 game was probably not our best.

> \[[[Matt Villalta]]] was pretty solid. He had some really good saves. I think on the two goals he maybe wanted those two back but on the other side he made some big saves too. Goalies have the be the best they can to give us a chance every night. Our best players have to be the best too, because otherwise it’s going to be hard. going. Chromiak too. He still needs time. We need to be patient a little bit. We try to help them get going as soon as possible.

> Ask me again tomorrow night after the game. We’re all in the same boat. I don’t know if it’s good or bad. Yes it is good today probably, but it all depends on how we react tomorrow. Right now there’s a lot of frustration. We all have to do a better job to come out of this funk. It starts with one period and then you go to the next one and the next one and we just couldn’t do it today. Hopefully we can do it better tomorrow.

> I think in general you want to simplify your game a little bit. You want to support each other on and off the ice, and that’s something we still struggle with. We came a little bit better in the third, yes, but overall we just didn’t support each other, we were not on the same page, the five guys on the ice, and before we did. That’s a big difference. Look how we scored, it can’t get any easier and it’s also hard work and a little bit of luck but we breakout really clean and we got rewarded with a goal. Guys have to believe in that and we’ve just got to do it over and over for 60 minutes.
