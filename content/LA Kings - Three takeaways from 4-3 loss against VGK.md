> 
> Three takeaways from the game


## Notes and Quotes
1) [[Jonathan Quick]]
2) The Kids are alright
3) Lack of sharpness


> When you look at the night, the first goal against was just terrible game management, coming out of the penalty box and not being aware. The second one is at the back end of a power play, you have to rewind the video a little bit, we were on the power play, and we negated it with the offensive zone penalty, so terrible game management there. Third one, an actual power-play goal and the fourth one was just stupidity. -- [[Todd McLellan]]
