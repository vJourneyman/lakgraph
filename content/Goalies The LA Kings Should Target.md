## Summary
> The Los Angeles Kings have not gotten off to the best start this season and a big part of that has come down to the play of LA’s goaltenders. While a lot of this season has been marred by inconsistent play from the entire team, no position has been more inconsistent than LA’s goalies and the stats back it up. The Kings currently are giving up the 4th best expected goals against at a very low 2.25 per 60 minutes at 5 on 5 hockey. This good defensive play is not being backed up by the goalies, who ranked 31st out of 32 teams for goals saved above expected as of November 20th. The Kings can’t expect to be a playoff team at the end of the year if they keep getting this level of goaltending from Jonathan Quick and Cal Petersen, and this LA team is way too talented to not be making the playoffs. So, how does LA fix this? The solution is simple, trade for a goalie. Let’s talk about a couple options the Kings could look to make a trade for.
