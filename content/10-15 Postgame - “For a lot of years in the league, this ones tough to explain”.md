## Summary
> In a polar contrast to their traditionally structured and defense-focused games a half-generation earlier, the LA Kings and Minnesota Wild erupted for a Smythe Division-level of offensive entertainment as the Kings ably responded to every Wild challenge in a building often unforgiving to teams trying to iron out their games.


## Notes and Quotes
> Fuckin’ hope we never have to win like that again, but give the guys a lot of credit. They battled back every time \[Minnesota] put us on our heels and it’s not very often the last couple years that we’ve been able to trade goals when we’ve needed them, and this was a night we needed to find some goals, and we found them. A lot of credit goes to the guys. That’s obviously not the way I think we want to be winning these games, but hey … sometimes throughout the season some games are going to call for that. -- [[Cal Petersen]]

> I had to decide there, when they tied it up, I was like, ‘we can’t give up another goal,’ and once we scored, I decided that was it. But we got some huge, huge blocks from [[Phillip Danault|Phil]], from [[Mikey Anderson|Mikey]] down the stretch, so I had some other goalies back there with me. -- [[Cal Petersen]]

> Today I felt pretty good from the start, and obviously a little more motivated playing against my old team. -- [[Kevin Fiala]]


## [[Todd McLellan]]
> You can see little snippets of things that are starting to happen, and that’s a positive sign.


> I thought that [[Gabe Vilardi|Gabe]] and [[Quinton Byfield]], other than maybe the penalty he didn’t need to take at the end, they were very capable of playing in those situations. … [[Trent Yawney]] has a tremendous amount of confidence in all six guys and he’s willing to put them out there. That’s how you grow as a team and how you grow as individuals. But we’re playing to win, and if we have to cut it back, we will. 

> For me, goaltending’s a lot ilke pitching. It’s tough to find your Cy Young Winner in April. You usually find them in September and October, and goaltending around the league is probably like that – it’s finding its way. We have to help our goaltenders as much as we can. We haven’t been as tight as we’ve been, we haven’t broken out as clean, and the \[penalty parade] puts a lot of pressure on them.
