## Notes and Quotes
### [[Alex Iafallo]]
> I didn’t have to do much, \[[[Blake Lizotte]]] made a great play and a nice shot \[from [[Mikey Anderson]]]. I just tried to be engaged right from the start and make plays from then on.

> I just try to play a 200-foot game, just trying to stay consistent and make good defensive plays, win wall battles and help push the team forward. I’m just going to try and keep doing that and keep getting better every day.

> Probably just protecting the puck, physical battles on the wall. Obviously, you can’t do much when you’re injured with stuff like that, so I had to stay mentally prepared for each situation.

> It felt great \[to be back]. I was watching all the time, it was hard to watch, you’re still cheering the boys on, but it’s definitely great to be back on the ice. I had fun out there.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> I think his play answered the question, but he’s just steady. He does a lot of little things and you could see early in the first period that he was ready to go. Sure, his legs and his hands probably don’t feel as good as he’d like them to, naturally, but his mind was sharp. He went to the right spots, real good sense of timing and I liked that line, I thought that line played really well.

### [[Pheonix Copley]]
> Yeah, it was kind of a broken play and it ended up where the guy had an open net. I just tried to push over and get whatever I could in front of it. Fortunately, it hit the blade of my skate, sometimes you get lucky I guess.

> Exactly that, I’m just taking it day-by-day and doing everything I can to help this team win when I get the chance.
