## Summary
> For the first time this year, the AHL’s best rivalry gets underway in San Diego on Friday night when the Reign and Gulls start their 8-game season series. Due to a new balanced AHL schedule format, that’s down from the 12 games they faced off in last year. Over that stretch, Ontario went 9-3 against the Anaheim Ducks top minor league affiliate.
