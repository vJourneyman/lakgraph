## Summary
> In the first night of a back-to-back, the Los Angeles Kings (11-7-1) have a chance to grab their second win against the Pacific Division tonight. Facing off against the Vancouver Canucks (5-9-3). Their Wednesday night matchup against the Edmonton Oilers had a playoff feel to it, and the Kings need to bring that same intensity tonight.
