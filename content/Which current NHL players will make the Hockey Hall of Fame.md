## Summary
> There will be a considerable number of current NHL players that enter the Hockey Hall of Fame when their playing days are done. The criteria for enshrinement are clandestine, confusing and controversial, thanks to a Selection Committee whose motivations and justifications are slightly more opaque than those of the CIA.
> Paul Pidutti is trying to change that on his site Adjusted Hockey. The Sudbury, Ontario, resident is an accountant by trade and a Hall of Fame geek by nature. So he started crunching numbers of Hall of Fame-worthiness and invented a unique statistical measurement of a player's candidacy, which he humbly called the Pidutti Point Share system.
> In speaking with Pidutti, and using our own projections, here is the latest tiered ranking of current NHL players and their Hall of Fame prospects.
