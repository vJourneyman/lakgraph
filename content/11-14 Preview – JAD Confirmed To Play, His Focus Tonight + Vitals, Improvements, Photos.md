## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> The Flames are playing pretty darn good hockey, in my opinion. We think about two weeks ago and record and if we listen to everything that’s around a winning streak or losing streak, we’ll be in a whole lot of trouble. They’re playing Darryl hockey, they play in straight lines, they defend well. I don’t see a lot of holes in their game to tell you the truth.

> There’s a lot more awareness of out-numbered situations, puck support, better positions, and that’s allowed us to defend better. I don’t believe it’s hurt us a lot offensively, we still get opportunities, so that’s been a big part of our improvement. I said this after the game the other day that the really good teams have those details all the time. You’re going have times where they get away on you, but for the most part, you believe in the details, you apply those details and you just motor along. There are some teams in the league that are doing a great job of that right now, I’d like to think that we can become one of them. This road trip for us will be a big test.

> Just be [[Jaret Anderson-Dolan]], you don’t have to do any more or any less. He’s proven to us that he’s ready to play, the work that he’s done away from the rink, his eagerness to be back in the lineup has been noted and we’ll try to put him in situations where we think he could succeed. Every time throughout his career that he’s been called upon to return to the lineup he’s given us some really good games. We expect that from him tonight.

> JAD anticipates well, he’s got a big, heavy body that can protect and win puck battles, he’s reliable defensively, can play on the penalty kill, he brings a lot of good things……we’re excited about putting him in and we believe he’ll make good on it.

### [[Drew Doughty]]
>  think we put a little bit more focus on playing better defense. We \[were scoring] a lot more goals, but at the same time we were giving up too many, so we had a big focus on fixing that. Goalies are stepping up, playing better, and all of our players have had a conscious effort to be better in our end.

### [[Alex Edler]]
> I think we talked a lot about executing our system and playing well defensively. When you’re good in your own zone, you’ll create offense that way, so we’re focusing on that and I think we did a pretty good job \[on the homestand].

### [[Jaret Anderson-Dolan]]
> \[I’ve tried to] make the most of the opportunity to watch games, get out there early and stay out there late, be the guy that’s working the hardest. That’s definitely my mindset and something I was trying to focus on. It’s just controlling what I can and being ready for when the opportunity comes.
