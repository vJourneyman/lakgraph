## Summary
> Despite outplaying and outshooting the Blackhawks, the LA Kings dropped a frustrating 2-1 game in overtime on Thursday night.

## Players
- [[Blake Lizotte]]

## Staff
- [[Todd McLellan]]

## Notes and Quotes
1) Lizotte tallies goal No. 3
   > When they’re playing and they’re playing well, they’re very trusting line and they can play against anybody, at any given time, in any zone. We haven’t seen enough of that from that group and tonight, they did a much better job. -- [[Todd McLellan]]
2) Nothing doing on the powerplay
3) Questionable decision in overtime
   > The NHL is all about winning games and they all balance out at the end but I thought tonight we may have deserved a better fate but we didn’t get it. The process part was one that, we’re not happy with, but we’re pleased to see process. -- [[Todd McLellan]]
