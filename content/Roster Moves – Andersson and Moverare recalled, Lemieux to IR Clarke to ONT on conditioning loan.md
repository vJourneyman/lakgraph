## Summary
> A few roster moves here to begin our day, with the Kings set to depart for Calgary this afternoon and the Ontario Reign set for a 3 PM tilt on home ice against the San Diego Gulls. Three players have changed hands this morning, with defenseman Jacob Moverare and forward Lias Andersson recalled from AHL-Ontario and expected to join the Kings to begin a four-game roadtrip. Additionally, forward Brendan Lemieux has been placed on injured reserve with a lower-body injury, while defenseman Brandt Clarke has been assigned to the Reign on a conditioning loan, and is eligible to play with Ontario against the Gulls later on today.
