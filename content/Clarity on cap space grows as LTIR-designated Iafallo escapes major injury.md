## Summary
> Early indications are that Alex Iafallo escaped major injury on his lower-body injury and that his status unofficially remains week-to-week, as Forum Report recently shared. Iafallo, who demonstrated excellent chemistry with Quinton Byfield and Gabe Vilardi the first week of the season, became tied up while positioning for space in the offensive zone at Detroit last week and fell back awkwardly with his skate planted in the ice.
