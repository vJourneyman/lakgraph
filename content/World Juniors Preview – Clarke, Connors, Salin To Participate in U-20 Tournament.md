## Notes and Quotes
### [[Marco Sturm]]
> \[[[Brandt Clarke]]] \[was] great. I think only in his first game, everything seemed new for him. Since then, he was outstanding. He gets involved, he’s a special kid. Like I said, he’s on the ice and then all of the sudden he shows up in front of the net and has a really good chance. Defensively he has to be more aware, but he wants to go \[to the net], and it’s good. I think that we don’t have a player in this organization like him and I think he will be good for us in the future.

### [[Mark Yannetti]]
> \[[[Kenny Connors]]] played heavy this past year and his compete level really showed through. Most young players don’t do well defensively in leagues like the USHL. Connors showed a pretty good defensive game. That said, you need to do more than just that to get drafted, there needed to be more offensive production and that’s why we didn’t take him the last year. Our scouts went into this year with \[Connors] as a guy to watch because we liked some of the things about him……we felt that a lot of the offensive improvement was made from specific skillsets and learning the game.

> \[[[Otto Salin]]]’s skating was the first thing that stood out. His skating is excellent. His skating allows him to get into situations and get out of them \[both good and bad]. He has the ability to skate the puck up the ice and push the pace; that’s a great thing. That’s an ingredient you can’t add later down the line and you can always pull a guy back. The fact that \[Salin] can skate himself in and out of trouble at this stage of his career is a good thing… and he has the ability to play more of controlled game.
