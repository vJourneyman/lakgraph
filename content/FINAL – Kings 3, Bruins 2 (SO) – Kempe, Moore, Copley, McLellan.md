## Notes and Quotes
### [[Trevor Moore]]
> Great effort by the guys tonight, we battled the whole way. \[[[Pheonix Copley]]] stood on his head, Juice with two big goals, that’s a good team win.

> We talked about it yesterday, we maybe tweaked a couple of things. We want to be more aggressive, give their best players a little bit less time, block shots, all of that kind of stuff.

> Yeah, it’s nice when the other guy didn’t score \[first], you can just go out there and try and win it, that was good. It’s very nice, it’s a good feeling for sure.

### [[Pheonix Copley]]
> I’m just trying to make the saves, not overthink it and trust myself. Whatever is going to happen, happens.

> Yeah, that’s huge. We could have easily packed it in, down by two, everyone knows these guys are good at home. To be able to push through and keep working until you’re able to find a way, that’s huge. These are the kinds of wins that you can build on, this is huge for us.

> I mean, they’re blocking a lot of shots, so that’s huge from my standpoint. When I did leave rebounds, getting those cleared out was another big thing. We talked a lot about the PK, we wanted to be better tonight and it played a bit part in getting a win.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> I think it was that way from the beginning. There wasn’t a single individual happy with what happened in Buffalo the other night night, yet as I said, it was a confusing game. I thought the third period in Buffalo, we didn’t show the resolve that we showed tonight, so it was a good opportunity for us to answer and reveal the character that I think is in that locker room. To fight back, we even had to fight back in the shootout when we were down. Not an easy building to do it in, not an easy way to end a trip, a long trip, but we’re pleased with it.

> You can’t open it up against this team. You start playing run and gun, they’re very talented. The penalty kill was obviously much better and the goaltender was a big part of that, he made some incredible saves when they had some open nets and he gave us a chance to crawl back in. The powerplay, which didn’t do very much or wasn’t full of momentum much of the night, was able to get it done at the end. Proud of the guys the way they responded.

> We had to play them even on special teams or we wouldn’t have a chance. We had to wait until the end of the game to basically get it, but we needed it, just to guarantee the one point, and then the penalty kill on the carryover was huge. Momentum swings our way, sometimes it can frustrate the other group, I’m not sure if that happened, they’re a pretty stable veteran group, I don’t think they get rattled easily, but it can happen.

> I would say that. You know, \[[[Pheonix Copley]]] had the period in Buffalo where we weren’t very good in front of him, that was a complete team debacle if you want to call it that. But, everything else he’s done, all the minutes he’s played have been pretty solid. He’s giving us a sense of confidence right now.

> We weren’t creating a lot of offense and that’d be two games in a row – actually, in Buffalo we created a lot – we just weren’t getting anything done and the game was getting thin as far as minutes left. We just thought we needed to do something and it ended up working out for us.
