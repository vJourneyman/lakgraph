## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> It's disappointing. Another hard game to evaluate. I've been saying that pretty much the whole year. Great that we come back. Great that we score goals. Great that we stick with it. But the carelessness is killing us.

### [[Adrian Kempe]]
> Everybody knew we needed a lot better of ourselves, and it showed in the third period. But it's tough playing a good 40 minutes and a not-so-good 20 minutes and expect to win. Good first and third periods. Second \[period], obviously didn't come up to our standards.
