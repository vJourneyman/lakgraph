## Summary
> Through the years, much has been made about Kings defenseman [[Drew Doughty]] playing against guys like Matthew Tkachuk in Calgary or Logan Couture in San Jose. However, nothing seems to get the Doughty stories fired up more than a game against the Maple Leafs played in Toronto. Be on the look out for some great soundbites over the next 24 hours.
