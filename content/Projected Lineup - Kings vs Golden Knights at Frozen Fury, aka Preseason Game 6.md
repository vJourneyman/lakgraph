## Summary
> Frozen Fury is back. No, not the Las Vegas version, the new Salt Lake City edition. However, the [Vegas Golden Knights](https://puckpedia.com/team/vegas-golden-knights) are involved. Does that qualify for partial credit?

## Notes

-  [[Lias Andersson]] put on waivers, implying that [[Gabe Vilardi]] and [[Jaret Anderson-Dolan]] will make the opening night roster.
