## Summary
> Forum Club. A pleasant game day to you from underneath the marine layer in El Segundo. This is still the marine layer, correct? With the recent thunderstorms and this summer’s humidity and mosquitoes I am concerned our beautiful Mediterranean climate is being overtaken by Florida and it’s not always easy to tell. This has little to do with tonight’s LA Kings – Seattle Kraken game (7:30 pm / Bally Sports West / ESPN+ / LA Kings Audio Network), which was preceded by an optional morning skate at TSPC.


## Notes and Quotes
> It’s going to be a big moment and it’s going to be really exciting, but after I get that first shift I think I’ll just settle in, do what I do, just play hockey again and it’s just another game, I think.  -- [[Brandt Clarke]]

> I thought last year that that Seattle team had developed an identity at being pretty quick and then on top of you. I saw that again last night. They didn’t give you a lot of time and space to maneuver, to make long thinking plays. You’ve got to be connected and quick to play against them. They’ve got a big, heavy back end that defends well. Obviously, their power play was very good last night. They’ve added a significant chunk of offensive talent to their team. They’ll be a tough team to have not only for us, but for 30 other teams.  -- [[Todd McLellan]]

> It wasn’t planned that way. I think the less he has on his mind and more instinctual hockey, the better he has for success.  -- [[Todd McLellan]]
