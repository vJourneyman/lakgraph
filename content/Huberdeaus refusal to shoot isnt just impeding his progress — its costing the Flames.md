## Summary
> For a time, it appeared the difference would be a pair of goals the L.A. Kings scored just ten seconds apart to open the third period.
> However, in the end it would be a pair of Jonathan Huberdeau passing gaffes that ultimately led to the Flames’ demise Thursday night as they fell 4-3.
