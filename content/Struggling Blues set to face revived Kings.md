## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Kevin coming in has added a dimension. I thought him playing in the position he did tonight balanced things out a little bit more. He’s been able to create with workers and creative players in his career, so he did a real good job there.

### [[Anze Kopitar]]
> I don’t think there’s a more confident guy around here. Listen, it’s great to see. Obviously, he’s had a couple tough years, a couple uncertain years, so the fact that he’s gotten off to a start that he is, it’s great for us, it’s great for him and we’re gonna need him to compete.
