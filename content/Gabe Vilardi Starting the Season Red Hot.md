## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> We talked as a group about giving him a really good opportunity, as much as we possibly could, throughout the exhibition season, the beginning of the season to try and get him in situations where he feels good about himself and we and the team feel good about him. We tried that, and he took advantage of that.

> It’s really refreshing to see him walk into the rink, he’s sticking his chest out a little, he’s smiling more, he seems to be enjoying the whole package and that’s great. He’s earned the opportunity to feel that way and as a result, he’s playing that way. Confidence.

> Personally, the coaching staff thinks he's a step quicker. He looks a little faster. Some of that's confidence, some of its feeling good. He feels good about himself, about his game. Teammates are excited about him, there's a lot of positive things in his world right now and we have to keep him there.

### [[Gabe Vilardi]]
> I just came with the mentality to take it day by day. I feel like I put so much pressure on myself ever since I turned pro, since that COVID season, so I'm coming in and just playing.
