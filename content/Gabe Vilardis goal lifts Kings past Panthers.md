## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Lots of high and lows throughout the night, change of momentum, open and then tight checking, it had a little bit of everything, so, a character win, yeah.

> That was the turning point in the game. Goaltender interference takes them off a power play and puts us on a power play, only 25 seconds of it … (Quick) had a sense of where the period was and that the power play was going to be short-lived.

### [[Gabe Vilardi]]
> (Expletive) right, it’s for \[[[Jonathan Quick|Quickie]]], man, Quickie’s the boss. It’s good to see that everyone sticks together. Obviously we know what Tkachuk does, he likes to stir things up.

> \[[[Alex Edler|Eddy]]] took a shot, it went wide, I kind of read it was going wide and then I got a lucky bounce that it came out on the other side of the goalline.
