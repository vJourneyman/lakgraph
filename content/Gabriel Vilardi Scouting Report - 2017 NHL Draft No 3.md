## Summary
> The second overall pick in the 2015 OHL Draft, Gabriel Vilardi has been a key cog for the Windsor Spitfires this season. He has played, and earned top line minutes, on a stacked club that is getting ready to host the 2017 Memorial Cup. In February, Vilardi missed some time due to an appendectomy, and it was clear that the Spitfires were hampered by his absence. He has picked up where he left off, and put up good numbers down the stretch and early into the OHL Playoffs. Vilardi has scored 29 goals and 61 points in 49 OHL games this season. Vilardi was part of the OHL White team that won a gold medal at the 2016 World Under 17 Hockey Challenge, putting up four goals and seven points in six games.
