## Notes and Quotes
### [[Jonathan Quick]]
> We did all the little things right. I think we only took one penalty tonight, especially when you’re playing against a team that’s as good on the power play as they are, so trying to limit the chances there. Then it’s block shots, clear rebounds and limiting their chances. I think that goes a long way.

> Yeah, I mean, consistency I think that’s the word you used, I think finding that, there are 32 teams trying to be more consistent and we’re one of them. The more consistent you are, the more predictable you are to your teammates, the better chance you have to win.

> There’s ways to win hockey games, you need to play really well defensively to win hockey games. It’s a tough league when you’re trying to outscore teams. I know, we know we have it in us in that locker room to play that way. Obviously it starts with goaltending, you need to make saves when the team needs it.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> 5-on-5, I thought we did a really good job of a lot of things. It was one of those nights where if the power play was sharp, we could have been up 3-0, could have been 1-0 them, two minutes into the third period they were on the powerplay with fresh ice and a chance to regroup. The adjustment between the second and third mentally was really important for our team. Obviously, it didn’t go well on the powerplay, we were all a little bit frustrated and when the break came, we reloaded. For the last three weeks we’ve talked about can we win a game 2-1 or 1-0 and we find a way to do it. I think that break between second and third help so simplification in that form I think was important.

> Actually, a fair amount. There were things that we had to prepare for Minnesota. Less special teams, penalty kill wasn’t bad, but the power play didn’t do its job, that was the disappointing thing in the game tonight. When your power play is not there and you can still win the game that was a real positive, but we did work on some things in practice yesterday that we haven’t had any time to and you can see some of the results here tonight.

> When you improve as a team, you look for perfection. We do it, you guys are looking for it. That type of question, we want the 5-0 win every night and it’s not there. There are a lot of 4-4 games, 5-4 games, with lots of offense, not so much defense. Tonight, there wasn’t a lot of offense either way, but one team found a way to get a goal. As you get better as a team, you’re looking for perfection on both ends, it doesn’t exist, and we still have a long way to go to really get to that point.

> Well, \[[[Gabe Vilardi]]]’s scoring, he’s responsible defensively, he’s a big body that keeps plays alive, so to this point, he’s fit in really well. Adrian, who naturally scores or has in the past has gone a little bit dry lately, so it’s nice to see somebody on the other side put one or two in. We do have some balance in our lines right now. I think it’s reflective in our record a little bit over the last five or six games. If we can keep everybody important and everybody balanced, I keep using that word, we’ll be better team for it.
