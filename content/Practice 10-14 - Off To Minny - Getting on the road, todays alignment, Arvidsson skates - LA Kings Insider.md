## Summary
>The Kings hit the ice this morning for practice in El Segundo before heading off to the airport to begin the first roadtrip of the season. The games are coming hot and heavy on this trip, with the Kings set to play five games in eight nights, beginning tomorrow evening in Minnesota against the Wild. The Kings will also visit Detroit, Nashville, Pittsburgh and Washington on this trip, with four of those five teams in the postseason last year, and the fifth a team that added at the NHL level in the offseason.


## Notes and Quotes
> We’ve got 80 left and 41 of them are going to be on the road so it’s really early in the year, get out on the road while we’re fresh, bond a little bit. It sounds like a cliche, coaches use that all the time, but it’ll be good for us to get away. The one thing that we don’t get and that we do need is a lot of practice time on this trip, but that’s the way it goes.  -- [[Todd McLellan]]

> Yeah, I think so. When you’re on the road, it’s only hockey and it’s just the guys and hockey, which is good. You can go to dinner most nights on the road and like I said, it’s just the guys, so it’s a good time to get to know people and it’s just nice to spend time together. Especially after a couple losses, I think it can turn things around for us.  -- [[Trevor Moore]]

> Yeah, definitely. We spend enough time in LA, I spent the whole offseason here, so it’s good to get out and get on the road and be with the guys. I think just spending time together on the plane, on buses and whatnot, it’ll be good. Get out for some dinners, enjoy ourselves a little bit, just us as a group, away from the families and whatnot. It’ll be fun.  -- [[Brendan Lemieux]]
