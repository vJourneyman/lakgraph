## Notes and Quotes
### [[Viktor Arvidsson]]
> I think we played fast and we executed. They did too, but we made better decisions with the puck and we were able to be effective.

> \[On The First] Durzi made a great play on the blueline to Moore, he got it over to me and it was nice to see it go in. \[On The Second] I came off the bench and kind of saw the play develop. Kevin made a great play on the wall and saw me coming in.

> Yeah, for sure. We have great players on our team and we just have to be committed to playing both ways. I think we were tonight.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> I thought it was a complete game by everybody. We didn’t have to rely on one or two people. Starting with the goaltender, I thought he played really well, gave us some confidence, made a big save in the third period that could have been a game changer. Throughout the lineup, I thought we had real good effort, we executed some of the things that we wanted and we learned some lessons. Last time we played them, they did some things that we needed to counter with and the guys applied them. It was a good night for us.

> You know, with that type of question, I’d say why do we have to ask it, and I know why you have to ask it, but we should be able to do that on a nightly basis. It’s in the DNA of our team and it’s a lot of fun to score goals and we’ve scored a lot of goals this year, we want to keep that up, but it should never be at the expense of our own end and our goaltenders. I believe that we can get better in that area and for the most part tonight, it was there.

> I thought \[[[Pheonix Copley]]] did, yeah. He was calm, you could tell he played in the league before. Calm, pretty collected, took a few shots for him to feel comfortable. Remember, he’s got a lot of new teammates, he hasn’t played with a lot of these guys, even throughout training camp it happened fast for him. I thought, for as good as he played, the guys wanted to play well for him and we needed that in our locker room.

> I’m not sure if the positional scorers change it, but the fact that we were able to start real quick \[was good]. If you remember a week ago or 10 days ago in LA they took it to us pretty good first period. We weren’t real happy with that, so the fact that we were able to come out and put our foot on the gas was a good thing for our team.
