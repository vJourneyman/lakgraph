> It is what it is right now. To be honest, I'm really excited right now for this new chapter.

> It was a great time playing there the last three years. It was fun with the guys. I loved the people there, just a special group. I had a lot of fun there. Very grateful to be playing there for three years. It was great.

### [[Rob Blake]]
> I just think the ability of his breakout-type plays, things that in a very close game or tight game he can change that, and he can help you win. He's competitive in that nature. We look forward to fitting him into our group.
