## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> It was a good opportunity for us to answer, and reveal the character that I think is in that room, or I expect to be. It’s not an easy building to do it in, not an easy way to win a trip – a long trip – but we’re pleased with it.

> Good things happen to good people.

### [[Trevor Moore]]
> We talked about it yesterday. We just tweaked a couple things. We wanted to be more aggressive and give their best players a little bit less time, block shots and all that kind of stuff.
