## Notes and Quotes
### [[Jonathan Quick]]
> Every day you come in and try to get a little better. When you get the opportunity to play you try and make the most of it. It’s nothing more than that.

> I think the league plays a different game now, so teams are better at creating scoring opportunities. The amount of video and analytics, I mean there’s guys that play the way that analytics is telling them to play. So there’s a lot more going on as opposed to 10, 12 years ago.
> It’s kind of on us to defend it. Looking at it analytically at where the shots are probably coming from, it is a different league. Obviously, the team dynamics here changed according to how the league is going.

> It’s same as the years when you’re having success. You show up, you work. Whether it’s a good game or bad game you have to move forward. It’s good to be in a spot where we made the playoffs last year and we’re currently in a playoff spot. But now we’ve got to fight to hold on to that spot.

> Every year you come in, you want to win a Cup. If anyone has any other idea of what they want to do this year than that, then we don’t have it. Every day, you work towards being a playoff team. And when you become a playoff team, then you work towards winning 16 games. That’s the only reason to play this game, to be honest, so anything other than that is a disappointment.

### [[Bill Ranford]]
> It’s been an incredible career for him, and it’s surely not over at this point. He’s been a guy that’s given us an opportunity to win. Guys have come in, and he’s still been able to hold the fort. That’s kudos to him. He’s got that fiery spirit and he’s still not willing to let it go at this point.

> We just look at his game and try to keep his game in the best order that we can. The only thing he cares about is wins. And that’s really the way he’s always approached it.
