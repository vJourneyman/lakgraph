## Summary
> Well, that escalated quickly.
> After the LA Kings willed an outstanding defensive performance through 40 minutes at KeyBank Center, their efforts unraveled and snowballed in the third as they allowed six third period goals in a stunning 6-0 loss to the Buffalo Sabres that again highlighted the period-to-period inconsistency vexing the team.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Responsibility, carelessness. The goal that they scored right after, we’re in a two-man forecheck and guys lose their man. I’ve been talking about it all year, so no, I can’t explain it.

> We took six penalties in the last half of the game, a lot of them in succession, only one of them in our zone. That tells you enough about our game.

>  Five of them came after the 10-minute mark. That’ll tell you enough.

### [[Anze Kopitar]]
> You want to finish the road trip with a win. As very average that this trip has been going, we can still go home with a .500 record. Do whatever we’ve got to do tomorrow to get ready for Thursday and then try to win a hockey game.
