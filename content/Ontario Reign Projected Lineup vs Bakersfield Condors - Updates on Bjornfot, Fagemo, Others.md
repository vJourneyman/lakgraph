## Summary
> After taking a multi-hour bus ride to Bakersfield and taking warmups on Friday night, the Reign-Condors game was abruptly postponed for what was deemed “unsafe playing conditions.” Essentially, there was a bent stanchion and some glass that wasn’t cooperating. The game will be made up at a date to be determined later.
