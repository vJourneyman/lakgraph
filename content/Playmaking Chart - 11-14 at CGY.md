## Summary
> Forum Report is very excited to bring you this feature, which will break simple possession statistics into a more nuanced understanding of who’s pushing the play towards the attacking net and how they’re doing it. It’s storytelling in chart form with some bullet points – a data-driven enhancement to what you saw the previous night. All statistics and commentary reflect the team’s five-on-five play.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Tough situation for a young man to come into, but \[[[Jaret Anderson-Dolan]]] did a really good job of keeping himself prepared both physically and mentally. I think sometimes when guys come in they’re overwhelmed by the speed and the pace, I didn’t see that in JAD’s case because he worked so hard and he was ready for it. Also tough circumstances when the team wasn’t really connecting as we had been heading into that game. You get caught in the mess, if you will, but he did an admirable job.
