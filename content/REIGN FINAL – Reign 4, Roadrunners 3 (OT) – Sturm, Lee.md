## Notes and Quotes
### [[Marco Sturm]]
> I think we had a really good start. Our first period was exactly how we wanted to play, and then we totally got away in the second period. Then the message was, go back to the first period and just the way we played, how we supported each other and how simple we played and, that’s what we did. When we do that, I think we’re going to be fine, but if not, then we’re in trouble.

> \[[[Nate Thompson]]]’s been excellent. With \[Brett] Sutter, we lost a big, big piece. A big leader in our room and I think Thommer is exactly what this group needs. He settled things down, I think he is having fun too and he’s okay being the dad for the team. And even for us coaches, it’s nice to have a guy like him around every day because those kids need to learn a lot and I think just watching him on a daily basis and even asking questions, I think it’s just going to help us.

> Yeah, definitely. I think any goal is a is a confidence booster, if you want to call it that, and especially with \[[[Quinton Byfield]]] sometimes, he feels like he works and he does a lot of good things and nothing happens. So that’s nice, hard work and doing the right thing gets rewarded. I think in the long run it always will, but those young guys don’t know it yet. That’s something you have to have to learn down the stretch, but he did it today.
