## Summary
> We published [our first trade board](https://theathletic.com/3995956/2022/12/15/nhl-trade-deadline-board-2022-23/) of the season this week and it’s always a fun exercise — trying to separate the league into buyers and sellers, knowing it’s an impossible task with roughly two-thirds of the season remaining to be played. Complicating matters on the trade front this year is the relatively competitive playoff races we’re seeing so far. Last year, it was all over by now in the Eastern Conference and the Western Conference wasn’t far behind.
