## Summary
> The No. 2 North American-based skater on NHL Central Scouting’s final prospect ranking behind consensus top pick Alexis Lafreniere, Quinton Byfield has the makings of a prototypical franchise centre. Peak potential think Evgeni Malkin or a left-shot Ryan Getzlaf.

## Notes and Quotes
- Made huge gains in two OHL seasons
  > Early in the year, when he didn’t have the puck, he wanted to chase it. In junior hockey, if you’re out of position, someone’s going to make a pass to your guy. Once he realized he should slow down, wait for it, and then attack and go get the puck, he got back into having it more. … As the season went on, and we got into playoffs, if their goalie was pulled, I had enough confidence that he could play in an odd-man situation to win the hockey game also.  -- [[Cory Stillman]]
  
  > A player with his size and strength, and I think there’s more size and strength to come, but to able to have soft hands and vision and make plays and when players try to eliminate him, he can beat you with power or he can beat you with hands and hockey sense, so it makes him very, very tough to contain and a very attractive prospect obviously. -- [[David Gregory]]
- Had a quiet WJC but the experience helped him grow
  > Playing with all the amazing talent and competing against the best players and best prospects going to the NHL, it was a lot of fun. I think I just tried to take some tips from a couple of the pro players on my team. They kind of showed me the ropes and gave me pointers. I tried to bring back (to the Wolves) all the tips and hints they gave me. The pace over there was a lot faster than the OHL, so I think I have more patience to slow down the game now in coming back from the world juniors. I think I can impact the game a lot more now.
  
  > Just getting to watch \[Lafreniere] and battle against him in practice, it really stepped up my game there. He does everything well. He even gets into the physical side as well, which kind of surprised me. He definitely brought a lot of energy to the table even with his skill. He had a couple of key goals for us. It was just nice getting to know him. -- [[Quinton Byfield]]
- He is half Jamaican
  > Being top for something is always cool and being the top pick among players of colour would definitely be something really special to me. I think the game is changing and the NHL is becoming more diverse. Definitely that would get kids motivated to start playing hockey, knowing that they can play, and that hockey is for everyone. -- [[Quinton Byfield]]
- Models his game after Malkin
  > It’s just an honour to be compared to that guy. He’s a soon-to-be Hall of Famer. I definitely watch as much Pittsburgh games as possible just to see what he does on the ice and how he plays. He’s a big, 200-foot centre and just the amazing offensive ability he has. Just how he plays is just unbelievable. I definitely watch him quite a bit and try and model my game after him. -- [[Quinton Byfield]]
- His minor hockey stats were silly
- He doesn’t use much tape on his stick
- He collects bowties
