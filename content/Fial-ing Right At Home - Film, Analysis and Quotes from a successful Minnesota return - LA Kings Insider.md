## Summary
> Whether it was extra motivation, the circumstances of the evening, or perhaps just a good plan coming together as intended, Kevin Fiala made the most of his homecoming yesterday in Minnesota. With a goal and two assists in the 7-6 victory, Fiala contributed offensively, in an arena he knows all too well. Fiala had 43 points from 41 games played at Xcel Energy Center last season, with his team winning 31 of those 41 games.


## Notes and Quotes

Analysis of key plays by [[Kevin Fiala]] in his first game back against Minnesota.

> We saw that for sure, the PP is supposed to score goals and obviously it doesn’t always work, but tonight we moved the puck quickly and everything was fast. We shot it, we retrieved it, we passed it, everything was quick and I think that’s why we were successful. -- [[Kevin Fiala]]

> On the ice, it always takes a little while for new players to adapt to a new system, new teammates, new language from the coaching staff, but you can that the talent is there. He’s got a real good skill level and I don’t think we’ve seen the best of Kevin yet and that will come out later on. We’re happy to have him, he’s a really good addition. -- [[Todd McLellan]]

> Much better tonight. Sometimes, on the road, you don’t think about it, you just play the game. When you’re not at home, sometimes you’re more of the underdog and maybe that was what helped today was that we just played the game, we didn’t think it. A good step, but we have to keep going. -- [[Kevin Fiala]]
