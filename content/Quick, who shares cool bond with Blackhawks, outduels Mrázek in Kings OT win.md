## Notes and Quotes
### Jack Johnson
> Whenever we play against each other, it's a nod, and you say 'Hi, how you doing?'

> I remember him almost being one of the first goalies that it was really hard, when you make a deke and you try to go upstairs on him. He (was) the first guy to hold his glove out, so you (would) put it right in his glove.

> It's a cool bond. I always root for him and cheer for him when I'm not playing him.

### Patrick Kane
> (He's a) different type of goaltender. Have had some great battles against him in the playoffs, and he's still getting it done, even as he gets a little bit older. He presents some different challenges with how low he is to the ice, how good he is side to side, so you really have to get the puck up in the upper part of the net, try to use those side-to-side one-timer passes to beat him.
