## Notes and Quotes
### [[Alex Edler]]
> Yeah, for sure. I mean, they, they had some great shooters there on their powerplay and you know, we got some blocks, some saves and some clears. It was good.

### [[Phillip Danault]]
> Yeah, that’s huge. We need to get our confidence going on the PK and that’s got to come from us as a unit, the goalie, the D, the forwards, everyone. Little details. We have to be way better on the PK, we have all the tools, we’ve just got to fix it.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> It was good, they’re a very dangerous powerplay, the number that they present to stats people can be really deceiving. You saw that in the pre-scout, they created a number of chances. To alleviate the pressure and get it down the ice and get fresh guys out, it helped us.

> In these situations, it’s hard to really worry about matches, because it can take players out of the game and it can affect rhythm, so you have to be able to rely on all four lines to play against whoever is out there and roll them. Sometimes, when you do that, you don’t get the jolt that you need to double-up a line or get them going, but you play they hand you’re dealt and you’ve got to react to situations as they arise.

> We may discuss it before the game, there might be a motivating attachment to it, but we don’t just sit down and say we traveled, we got in late, we play at 6, they know that. This won’t be the last time we have to do this, certainly not the first and we’re not the only team. That’s the way it goes.
