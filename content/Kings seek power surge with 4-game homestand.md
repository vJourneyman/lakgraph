## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> They were firm, they were hard, they won a lot of puck battles. \[[[Arthur Kaliyev]]] was physical, he stripped a lot of pucks and fed those players. ([[Rasmus Kupari]]) won faceoffs.
> [[Jaret Anderson-Dolan|JAD]] obviously worked his butt off and scored. Many elements that are needed for success as a line, I think we saw that constantly from those three. They should all feel really good about themselves and should be prepared to do it again on Sunday.

### [[Jaret Anderson-Dolan]]
> It’s kind of always been my focus. I think if you’re taking care of that, the rest will kind of take care of itself and it did tonight, and it helped contribute to a win, which is the most important thing.
