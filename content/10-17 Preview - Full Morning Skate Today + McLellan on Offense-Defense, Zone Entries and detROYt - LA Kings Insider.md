> I think you saw some of it last year. It’s just hard to put all the years together because they were they’ve been estranged themselves with COVID, but our entry stats from an analytical standpoint have improved. They can still get better, but they’ve improved and we want to continue to grow that. -- [[Todd McLellan]]

> Getting those rush chances and driving the net is going to help us win games. Scoring off the rush is going to be huge, getting shots off of those, not missing any passes and staying consistent there and we’ll be fine. -- [[Alex Iafallo]]

> We’ve got a lot of fast guys on this team, we play the 1-3-1 and create turnovers in the neutral zone and go from the other way, right away,” Vilardi added. “That’s something for sure. We’ve got [[Kevin Fiala|Kevin]] now and he’s nasty off the rush. It’s something I think we can continue to do and catch teams off with. -- [[Gabe Vilardi]]

> It was a bummer last year. I think the first time was the most special, now it’s just a little bit more excitement and a little bit more energy. -- [[Matt Roy]]

> It’s great, it’s obviously fun to play the Wings, and to be here, but it’s more special just to see my family, seeing how excited they get. I’ve had a lot of friends reach out to them and they get super excited, which makes me excited. It’s kind of come back full circle. -- [[Matt Roy]]
