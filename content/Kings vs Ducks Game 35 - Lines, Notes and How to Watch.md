## Notes and Quotes
### [[Kevin Fiala]]
> For me, it's just another game. Obviously, there is history there but I think we should treat it like every other game.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Same preparation for our staff. It should be the same preparation for the players. There's no need to look at standings and increase or decrease your preparation. If you have a routine, standings should not affect it. And, they're our rival, this is not going to be an easy game. And if anyone expects it to be, shame on them because it will show up tonight.
