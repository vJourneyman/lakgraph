## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> It can be argued on any given night which is one and which is two and the way we have it structured right now, the guys that are rested are usually the ones that are starting. Traditionally, it’s just been okay Kopi, let’s go, and he could be exhausted and we feel it. Now, we’ve been able to put two units together where okay, Kopi is tired, Drew, you’ve been out a lot, let’s get a breather and put the other unit out or vice versa. I think that’s allowed us to start fresher than maybe we have in the past.

> Their puck movement is quick. They’re obviously confident, but their puck movement is quick, there’s an intensity to their group and I think the pace at which they’re playing allows them to create some opportunities off of those passes. You’re either ahead or you’re behind on the powerplay. If you’re behind, you’re probably going to be frustrated and if you’re ahead, you’re probably creating chances and what I mean by that is the pace of play and attacking the other team’s mistakes or weaknesses.

> I think \[[[Mikey Anderson]]] always has, it’s just not as much as maybe other guys. He values the the shutdown role so much that sometimes those guys stay home a little bit more than others that are higher risk takers, but when he sees it, he goes, he does jump in.

### [[Arthur Kaliyev]]
> It’s awesome, we have the perfect combination of everything that we need. I think we’ve done a pretty good job of it, we’ve been making great plays and moving the puck fast and getting good shots off, everything.

### [[Viktor Arvidsson]]
> With \[our unit], we just try to make plays and play quickly and when we see plays that are open, we try to hit it. \[On Friday], we found a way, so that was good.

### [[Mikey Anderson]]
> On a play like that, I know that Kevin can see things like that happen, so it’s trusting him to make a read or find a spot. Obviously it was a good play by him, tough that it got called back.

> Yeah, I’m trying to add more of that to my game. I’m feeling more comfortable with picking and choosing the spots to do it and obviously it helps when our forwards are helping to cover and take care of us.
