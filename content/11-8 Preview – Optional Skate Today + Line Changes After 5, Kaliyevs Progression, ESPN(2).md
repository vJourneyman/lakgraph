## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> They’ve played better, they’ve given up less, they’ve settled in and played way more towards what I believe they can do, what they believe they can do, from a defensive perspective.

> I think Kevin being where Kevin is has opened up a couple of players in \[[[Rasmus Kupari]]] and \[[[Carl Grundstrom]]]. Grunny has scored a fair amount over the last little bit, he had a glorious chance in Chicago with an open net and just missed off a good play by Kev. It’s balanced our lines out and I think it’s helped us win a few games.

> He’s improving, as he did last year. There’s a lot of responsibility that goes into a second-year player. You’re responsible every day for your game and you’ve got to bring it and Arthur is figuring out that part in Year 2, but he is improving and he’s working hard at improving in those areas.

> He seems to get more done with those two for whatever reason. I’ve liked the way that line has played in the last little bit, when they get back together they have something. They hold each other accountable, sometimes there’s the three of them bickering about what should or shouldn’t happen, but once the play starts again, they’re a pretty good unit.

### [[Anze Kopitar]]
> It’s coming along. It’s obviously a work in progress and there are still some things that we can definitely do better, but we’re getting comfortable with each other and we’re finding some chemistry together.
