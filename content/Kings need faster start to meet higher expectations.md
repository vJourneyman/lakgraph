## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> We’re not sneaking up on anybody. There are teams in our division that want our spot, and we’re ready for that challenge.

> Plus two or three doesn’t get you into many postseasons.


### [[Kevin Fiala]]
> Not just us two but all of us can interchange, and I think that’s what good power plays do. You don’t have a spot, you see how it goes, fill in wherever you are and play from there.

### [[Drew Doughty]]
> We’ve been struggling a little bit throughout the preseason, and that’s something you obviously don’t work during the summer because you’re not trying to hurt guys or anything like that. That’s something that you need to get back through preseason, because you can’t work on it, it’s probably the main thing: defending for real and net play.
