## Notes and Quotes
### [[Viktor Arvidsson]]
> It was awesome. It’s so fun for \[[[Trevor Moore]]] and I think we played a solid game all the way through. I’m happy for him.

>Yeah, it was competitive, going up against two of the best players in the world is fun and it’s a challenge. I think we embraced it really well, we worked hard and we got rewarded.

> Yeah, I feel like that’s always there but today it was extra and it was really good. It all started with JAD, who blocked two on his first shift, and then Kopi and everyone just laid out and helped Cal in net.

### [[Cal Petersen]]
> To put it frankly, we should just show that game every single training camp, because that’s basically Kings hockey in a nutshell. I don’t know if we can do it any better than that. The amount of sacrifice the guys did, from the drop of the puck, Durz saving one right there. I wouldn’t be surprised if every guy had a blocked shot. That was as impressed as I’ve been on that side of things as long as I’ve been as a King.

> Good. Just reciprocated what the guys were doing in front of me, but just trying to take it one game at a time. You have to win games in different ways on different nights in this league so we’re just trying to find the winning formula each night.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Really well. We went from shoddy, I think was the word I used in Calgary, to committed. It looked different, it felt different, we played way closer to our identity, likely the way we have to play to beat teams like this and a lot of teams in the league. Proud of the group.

> Yeah, I think you have to give them a lot of credit for the little things they did without the puck. When they’re doing that, like blocked shots right off the bat, when they’re doing that, everybody seems to do it and it’s contagious. Leaders lead, everybody else follows. I thought Kopi and his line did a tremendous job, they had heavy minutes and it’s nice to have that 1-2 punch to go against a team like that.

> We’re happy for \[[[Trevor Moore]]]. He works his butt off night after night, does those things that I talked about earlier, those defensive things that our key to winning some nights and he found a way to put the puck in the net. He’s been there all year for us offensively, it just hasn’t gone in a lot for him. I haven’t looked lately but I know he was leading us in shots on goal, that means he’s around the net a lot. Finally they’re across the goal line.

> Calm. There was a lot of panic in and around the net and \[[[Cal Petersen]]] made some really good, tough saves and then the one the simple ones he was making. I thought that he managed the game well. There were times where we needed whistles to get rest or changes and he did a real good job of that too.
