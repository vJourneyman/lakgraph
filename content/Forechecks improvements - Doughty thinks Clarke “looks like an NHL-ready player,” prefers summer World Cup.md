## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> I think that can really energize a group, especially at the back end of a trip. We just thought our energy stores would be a lot better by doing what we did.

> \[...] and discuss how I’m going to use those moments as teaching points for the group as a whole. … Not embarrassing players, but I don’t think they like surprises, especially if they’re showing up negatively in a clip.

> Understanding how you have to do it, where the puck goes. A good forecheck’s predictable. You can dictate where the team is going to make the play, and we weren’t doing that early in the year. We were doing it \[Thursday] night. But there’s also the back end of the forecheck – what are you leaving, and if it doesn’t go your way, can you be in position to make sure you’re adequately taking care of the neutral zone in your own end? And we weren’t really good in that area.

> There’s no fear in [[Brandt Clarke|him]] – and I don’t mean about the physicality and going into the corners, it’s just the fear of mistakes during the game.
> He’s certainly earned the opportunity to keep playing, and he’ll continue to do that.

### [[Drew Doughty]]
> I’m telling [[Brandt Clarke|him]] after shifts, ‘don’t get outside the dots here,’ ‘don’t do this,’ or ‘you did a great job doing this.’ I’m always talking to him and he’s always asking questions, too, which is nice to see. But I had a lot of help when I was a young guy, and I’m a veteran now and I’m helping the young guys as much as I can.
