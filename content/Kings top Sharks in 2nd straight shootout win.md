## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> \[[[Pheonix Copley]]]'s made some really big saves, he's made some simple easy saves. Obviously, in the shootout, he's had success back-to-back nights. Right now, he's running hot, and we'll likely keep going there.

> Tonight, our penalty kill did a good job. Really good in overtime. And when your special teams aren't elite, which the penalty kill is not right now, sometimes you lose a little confidence in it. I don't sense that.
