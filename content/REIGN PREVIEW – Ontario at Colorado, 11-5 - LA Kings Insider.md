## Summary
> The Ontario Reign take on the Colorado Eagles for the second time in three nights Saturday evening, completing a series in Loveland this week. Ontario’s furthest road trip to date began Thursday with a 2-0 shutout of Colorado, earning a little revenge against the club that ended their Calder Cup Playoff run last spring in the second round. That series saw the Eagles pull off a three-game sweep to advance to the Pacific Division Finals where they eventually fell to the Stockton Heat. Last season the Reign finished with a 2-3-1-0 record in six contests against the Eagles.
