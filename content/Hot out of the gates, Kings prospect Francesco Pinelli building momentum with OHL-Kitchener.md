## Notes and Quotes
### [[Francesco Pinelli]]
> It was a really big game for our team, winning in Game 7, it was good that we got past the first round and gained that playoff experience. We’ve got that under our belts this season, so we know what to expect moving forward. It was growing experience for our team and myself personally.

> Overall strength – I had to get stronger because players at the next level (AHL and NHL) are much bigger and faster. Strength and speed are such big proponents at the professional levels, so those are two areas I really focused on in the offseason. I also worked on the details of the game too, like face-offs and rounding out my 200-foot game. I knew I had to work on all parts of my game to help me be a good player in every zone.

> I knew what to expect going into my second development camp. It was a really fun experience. Being able to see the players and the Kings staff again was really fun. To have the opportunity to come to camp and do pretty well felt really good.

> I just stuck to my game. I had a really good offseason, so I felt comfortable with where I’m at. I’m working to get better every day no matter the time of year.

> What really stood out about the Kings veterans was how they carried themselves around the rink. When they’re at the rink they were all so professional – taking care of their bodies, setting a good example off the ice and also on the ice by setting the tone of the practice. Things like that really stood out to me and that’s what makes a great leader. When I came in, [[Anze Kopitar]] took the time to welcome me. He’s a lot older than me, but he’s a super nice guy and a lot of guys of his stature can think they’re too cool for the younger guys. He’s the complete opposite and those kinds of little things we really appreciated.

> We’re only 12 games in, but I think I’ve played some really good games and it’s been positive. I’m playing well because I’m using my speed to my advantage and using my hockey IQ. Those are two big parts of my game where I feel I can take advantage of our opponents. I’ve also cleaned up my game in the defensive zone and I’m continuing to focus on that to become a consistent 200-foot player.

### [[Mike Donnelly]]
> It’s harder for the younger guys when they come to their first development camp. Frankie Pinelli, it was different for him this year versus last year. You didn’t really notice a lot of him \[last year] and then in the scrimmage games \[this year], you notice ‘wow he does have some really good stuff.’
