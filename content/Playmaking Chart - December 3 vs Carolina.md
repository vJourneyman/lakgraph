## Summary
> Forum Report is very excited to bring you this feature, which will break simple possession statistics into a more nuanced understanding of who’s pushing the play towards the attacking net and how they’re doing it. It’s storytelling in chart form with some bullet points – a data-driven enhancement to what you saw the previous night. All statistics and commentary reflect the team’s five-on-five play.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Samuel Fagemo]]
> Anytime a young player comes up and gets his first goal, It’s exciting for not only him but for a lot of people in his world. His parents and friends and girlfriend and everybody that’s helped him get to the NHL. It’s kind of an override marker than that first lap when you play your first game. So, \[[[Samuel Fagemo]]] has arrived. I thought he had a good strong game tonight.
