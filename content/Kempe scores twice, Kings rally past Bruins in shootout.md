## Notes and Quotes
### [[Adrian Kempe]]
> Power play got us one, so that was big for the momentum. \[In a] 2-0 game going into the third, you get one, you never know what happens. \[We] put some pressure on them, so once again, great team effort.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> The penalty kill \[5-for-6] was a big part of it. I don't think we want to be in that situation, but the guys did a tremendous job of attacking loose pucks when they were there and collapsing when they had to. Again, \[[[Pheonix Copley]]] played a big part in it. It felt like we had a chance to win if we got through that, and I think they played that way.

### [[Trevor Moore]]
> I didn't want to have to go anywhere else, so it's a good feeling to just get it done and just focus on hockey and winning games.
> (In the shootout) it's nice when the other guy doesn't score so you can just go out there and try to win it.

### [[Pheonix Copley]]
> We could have easily packed it in down by two. Everyone knows these guys are good at home, so being able to push through and keep working until we were able to find a way, that's huge, and these are the kinds of wins that you can build off of, so this is huge for us.
