Jacob Middleton of the [[Minnesota Wild]] reflects on being picked by the Kings and experiencing their Development Camp.

## Notes and Quotes
> It’s interesting how quickly bumps and bruises occur. Good for us to have a few of those right now. -- [[Todd McLellan]]

> Kevin and I have had a lot of climate changes over the years. -- [[Dean Evanson]]

> We played better in the preseason, I think. I can see our line will be very effective, and I think tonight will be the night. -- [[Kevin Fiala]]

> That’s a true quality of his.
> I think by this point he understand our demeanor. When I say, ‘ours,’ our coaching staff. But also his teammates – who’s emotional, who isn’t, what gets guys riled up, what’s the boiling point between good and bad? And often for a player, once that gets clarified, it’s a lot easier. … But it is way more about the Kings than it is Kevin tonight. I wish it was the other way, but it just isn’t. -- [[Todd McLellan]]
