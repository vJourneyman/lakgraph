## Summary
> The Los Angeles Kings (6-6-1) have been plagued by inconsistency all season. One of the highest-scoring offenses in the league this season dulled against the Chicago Blackhawks on Thursday, however, they finally looked like the defensively solid unit we saw last season.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> For the most part \[[[Rasmus Kupari]]]'s done, defensively, the things we want from him. His ability to break up plays, hunt on the way back, using his legs, defending in those situations has been really good. We're working on him, with his offensive production and the ability to create there. We're working on faceoffs with him. We think he can help us on the penalty kill, so there's been a lot of positive things. But, like every player, there's still more to accomplish.

> We do a pretty good job of pre-scouting. Stylistically they (Florida) play a certain way and we'll be aware of it. There won't be any lack of information, we won't over information them either. There will be two or three things that are specific we have to do well in this game to give ourselves a chance to win.
