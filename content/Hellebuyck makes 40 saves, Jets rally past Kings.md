## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> We still don't know how we want to play. I would think the experiment of run and gun that we are trying to play, how much more evidence do we need that it doesn't work?

### [[Anze Kopitar]]
> Whether we can blame it on the PK, not scoring on the power play, bad changes, turnovers, whatever, the bottom line is we can't give up six and think we have a chance to win.
