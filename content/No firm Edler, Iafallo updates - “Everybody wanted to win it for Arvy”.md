## Notes and Quotes
> Mentally, I don’t think there was really much time. Just go out there and let the body take over. Physically, I had about five minutes to roll out, stretch quickly. I skipped a little bit, and then it was ‘get ready.’ Definitely weird, but I think I handled it well and I’m happy with how the game turned out. -- [[Sean Walker]]

> I just wanted to make sure to score, and he made a great play. He backchecked hard and stripped me, and right when I shot it, he got his stick on it, so it was a good play by him. -- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]

> Everybody wanted to win it for Arvy. You can see a lot of guys going over and tapping him, saying, ‘hey, no problem, we’ve got this,’ and that’s how it ended. But we shouldn’t want to be doing that too often, putting ourselves in that situation. -- [[Todd McLellan]]

> Obviously Edler didn’t play, and that’s never a good sign, so we’ll see how he is in the morning, and I don’t have an update for you yet on Iafallo. -- [[Todd McLellan]]

> We know it was not acceptable the last couple games, so definitely it was a little better tonight. -- [[Phillip Danault]]

> This was the first game I felt like myself again, so it was a good step in the right direction, I think. -- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]

> Great play by him to get out of there quickly. There were four guys on the blue line, I think, so it was a great heads up play and a great pass by Mooresy. -- [[Phillip Danault]]

> Well, we yelled at Sean Walker to get his equipment on. No warm-up, and he played. That’s all you can do. The game plan doesn’t change because one guy goes down. Next man up, and that’s how it happened. And for me … that may be the best way for him to go in and play. No thinking, just go play the game. His ability to come back from the injury not having played for a long, long time, I thought tonight he did an admirable job under difficult circumstances, yet it may have favored him. -- [[Todd McLellan]]

> It was five minutes into warm-ups. I was kind of just hanging out in the back. I heard Eds took a puck somewhere and just to be ready, so I started my warm-up there and that was kind of it, then. Just got ready and got out there. Not the usual routine and everything, but I think I handled it well. -- [[Sean Walker]]
