## Summary
> Taking the Kings to a surprise playoff berth last season was one of [[Todd McLellan]]’s best coaching jobs over his career as an NHL bench boss. Trying to build on that this season is becoming one of his most confounding jobs.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> We got to care about more situations that are important coming back to our end. “We have world-class players, guys that we brought in to be shutdown players that missed assignments tonight. It’s not the bottom six. This is the top six right now. That’s great that we’re scoring all these goals but obviously we’re not getting enough points. And I’m not sure that we value the checking part as much as we have in the past. It’s just go and score.
> It’s disappointing. Another hard game to evaluate. I’ve been saying that pretty much the whole year. Great that we come back. Great that we score goals. Great that we stick with it. But the carelessness is killing us.

> And that’s where it’s confusing really. Because we have outstanding efforts from a lot of guys. And they produce goals. Guys that maybe don’t score quite as much. Then there’s others that just didn’t get it done and needed to.

> We were told after it was ruled upon and obviously the league and the referees get together that it was gloved ahead but that we had possession. I obviously don’t agree with it but there’s nothing I’m going to do about it.

### [[Alex Edler]]
> \[[[Pheonix Copley]]]’s really solid and calm. You notice that when you play in front of him. You know he’s kind of positionally in the right place all the time to be able to make saves. That’s huge.

### [[Adrian Kempe]]
> First and third period, we showed that we played really tight in the D-zone and closed quick on their team. “Keep it simple. Get pucks to the net. It’s like the easy things you always say but that’s the way we play and when we play our best, that’s the way we play.
> In the second period, I felt like (we were) too risky. Too many turnovers. And that’s not our game. That’s not what we agreed on earlier in the year, the way we should play. It’s simple things but that’s how it is.
