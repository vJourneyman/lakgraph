## Summary
> But there is news to speak of for Tuesday night’s tilt with the Buffalo Sabres. All-star defenseman Drew Doughty will return to the lineup after missing Sunday’s game. The Kings appear set to roll out Doughty, Mikey Anderson, Matt Roy, Tobias Bjornfot, Sean Durzi, and Sean Walker on the blue line. Alexander Edler and Jordan Spence stayed on quite late following morning skate, so unless there are shenanigans afoot or a sudden change in player health, Edler will come out for Doughty’s return. Todd McLellan had spoken last week about Edler rest days built into the schedule.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Our penalty kill has to be better. (The Sabres) do some unique things on the power play, so the pre-scout would likely help. Your penalty kill units have to work as four, they have to understand what might be coming, and between the four skaters and the goaltenders, they have to get the job done. We have not been getting the job done consistently in that situation.

### [[Alex Iafallo]]
> That was my era. I know they haven’t brought that one back for a while. It’d be cool if we were wearing our throwback jerseys, too.

> It feels pretty good getting back. Obviously, you’ve got to get your vision back, but we’re four games in now after my injury so I’m feeling pretty good. Lungs feel good, legs feel good, so now I’ve just got to keep playing well and playing my 200-foot game.
