## Notes and Quotes
### [[Phillip Danault]]
> Defensively we have to be better, move the puck quicker, we have to get open. We put this game behind us and we’ll keep that third period in mind.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Just because we fought back and made it 6-5, there are a lot of things that we have to fix.
