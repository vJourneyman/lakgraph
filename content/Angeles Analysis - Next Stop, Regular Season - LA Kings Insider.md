## Summary
> Nothing too crazy today, with the team off from practice on a transition day between the preseason and the regular season. The Kings have two players on waivers today – Jacob Moverare and Pheonix Copley – as we approach the official, roster submission in advance of Tuesday’s season opener. We’ll receive the fate of those two individuals in the morning, with a massive list of players on waivers today from around the league. We’ll receive official clarity on the roster tomorrow, though with those two moves now made, you can pretty much see how the Kings will roll entering Opening Night from a roster standpoint, though you can’t rule out what could happen with waivers or injuries over the next 24 hours.
