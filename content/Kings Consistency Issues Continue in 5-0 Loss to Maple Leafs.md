## Notes and Quotes
### [[Anze Kopitar]]
> We just didn't play nearly as good as we needed to, obviously. I mean, even after the first period it was 0-0, but in large part thanks to Quickie (Jonathan Quick), quite frankly all of the credit goes to him. We weren't good enough.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> It was obviously both. I think you've got to have on to have the other, and the mental part isn't there, there's no way the physical part will be there. It was both, I thought we were light and slow in the first period. Weren't winning any races and when we did even come close to winning any of them we were real light on our sticks and light in body positions. And it kept on going all night.
