## Summary
> Quinton Byfield is back in the AHL. At least for a little while.
> On Sunday, the Kings announced that Byfield would be assigned to the Ontario Reign. He's just returned from an illness that's kept him out for almost two weeks and needs to get back up to speed.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> He’s back \[on the ice], which is a great sign. He lost a lot of weight and he’s going to need to get strong again. He’s going to need some time to recover.

> I’ve always said I don’t think anybody should lose their spot to injury or illness, it’s outside of their control. Usually you lose your spot in the lineup based on indifferent play, so we’ll see when everybody gets back. No decision has to be made right now on Quinton or Ras or anybody else in our lineup, because \[Byfield] is not yet ready to play.
