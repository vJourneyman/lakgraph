## Notes and Quotes
### [[Darryl Sutter]]
> \[[[Adrian Kempe]]’s a mature player in terms of his whole skill set. That’d be number one. I think for sure you’ve seen him as an 18 or a 19-year-old, and his first three years pro as a high-end skill set player, but I think you’re just seeing a real mature game out of him now. He’s a guy that can play a lot of situations, which every coach loves, and if you need him, to play all three positions, too. \[Forum Report: Was that something you could see in his game? I remember you being complimentary with him at an early training camp.] Yeah. I think what was really important, when you see his background, when he played on those national teams, how they’d slot him. They’d slot him in that checking role or that penalty killing role even though he was a first round pick. So, everyone thinks, ‘well, he’s an offensive guy,’ But you can see that with him, right? And he had that skating ability always.
