## Notes and Quotes
### [[Marco Sturm]]
> It was even fun for us to. I know we won the game, but I think it was a good game. On both sides, guys were worked hard. They worked for each other. We had an unbelievable goalie tonight, so thanks to him we got the two points.

> He made, especially in the second period, San Diego pushed really hard, they had a breakaway, they had a penalty shot. So \[ [[Pheonix Copley]] ] saved all of them and as players, I think if you see that, and yeah, it shouldn’t happen, but it’s a good problem to have a guy like him in the net. He calms things down. He had some rebounds, but most of them he covered it well. He was by far the number one star today.

> I think the stuff we did today was more like the team we wanted to be. We touched on a lot of things. I think we wanted to be better defensively and I think that’s what we did, and the guys have to buy in and I think they slowly do. I’m not a big fan of a high-risk game, that’s just not me and that’s not the LA Kings so we have a plan and I think today they showed it. Sometimes yeah, you’re not going to score eight goals every night, but things will happen and I’d rather win those kinds of games than 8-2, I can tell you that.
