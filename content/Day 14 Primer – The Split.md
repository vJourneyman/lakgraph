## Contributors:
- [[Zach Dooley]]

## Players
- [[Quinton Byfield]]

## Summary
> The Kings group has been reduced to 34 skaters, though we’re seeing a group with fewer individuals truly in action with the Kings when factoring in injuries and illnesses.

## Notes
> [[Todd McLellan]] has said in past years that he prefers a smaller group when working with his regular NHL roster, designed to maximize repititions and minimize standing around during drills.

> No [[Quinton Byfield]] on the ice this morning, who is labeled as day-to-day with an illness.
