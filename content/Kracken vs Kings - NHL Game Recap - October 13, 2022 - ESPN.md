## Summary
> Brandon Tanev scored the go-ahead goal early in the second period and the Seattle Kraken rebounded from an opening loss to beat the Los Angeles Kings 4-1 on Thursday night.


## Notes and Quotes
> Well, it’s a losing streak to start the season already ’cause we’re at two and haven’t put one on the board yet. You get to recreate yourself every year, and the reference point we had after Game 1 was last year. Now we have six periods in the bag, and much better defensively today. Gave up far fewer opportunities than we did against Vegas. Still many things to work on.  -- [[Todd McLellan]]
