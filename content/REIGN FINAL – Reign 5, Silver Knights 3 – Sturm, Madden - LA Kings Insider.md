## Notes and Quotes
### [[Marco Sturm]]
> We had a really good start. Everyone was really going and the first goal against kind of broke us down a little bit. I think the momentum was gone all of a sudden. They had it and they had the lead. It was not the prettiest game, but that was just one of those games. I told the guys, hockey is not always pretty and those are the games that we have to win, and we did. I think we got a lot better in the third. We just controlled the game a little bit better. There’s still work to do but I’m happy and I think we’re happy with the win tonight.

> That was huge. That was the biggest kill, having almost two full minutes three against five. The guys did an outstanding job. I think \[Villalta] was good in the net today. He looked pretty strong. Special teams is always really important in any league. There were a lot of penalties but I think it was good for us on the PK. We found a little bit of a rhythm. We know we have a good power play but we have to work for it too. It was nice to see that they responded too.

> I liked him. I think he rebounded really well after the first goal. Maybe he would want that one back, but he was involved. He was ready. He played the puck really well. That’s a big strength and he came up with big saves at the right times. He was really good tonight.

> That’s why I played them almost until the end. They deserved it. I know that with some of the penalties, they’re sometimes sitting on the bench a little longer than they wanted to, but that’s just part of the game. I think some other guys stepped up today and that was really nice to see.

### [[Tyler Madden]]
> I felt good. I think my line played a great game. I love playing with those guys and we started off hot and continued the rest of the game. It was a good game. Any time you get the puck \[to [[Akil Thomas]]] below the tops of the circles, it’s a good thing. He can rip it. I enjoyed playing with him and Dudas especially.

> I came down thinking pass the whole way and I think the goalie saw that. As soon as I picked my head up and looked at him, he was already cheating, so I saw short side and I just put it there.

> I think the first game was kind of just figuring it out a little bit. Coming back, I didn’t get that many skates before \[the games] so it felt a little slow toward the end. Today, I was well prepared, did the right things, and felt pretty good out there.

> I think just playing all the games this year, and not just playing in them, but being a factor in every single one. It was a good start, but there’s a lot more to do.
