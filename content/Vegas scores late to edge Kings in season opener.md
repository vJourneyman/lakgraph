## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> We got an outstanding effort by our goaltender and we still had a chance to win, we had a chance at a point, really.

> The focus will be on the play at the end. But our team gave up 51 shots on goal tonight.

> The first goal against was just terrible game management, coming out of the penalty box and not being aware.

>As we drive home tonight, weâ€™re not going to be too concerned about No. 13 \[[[Gabe Vilardi]]] 

### [[Anze Kopitar]]
> Positives, we scored a power-play goal and I feel like we battled back a couple of times after falling behind, especially in the third.
