## Notes and Quotes
### [[Alex Edler]]
> We weren’t happy with that game, I think that’s very obvious. Talked about it, that we need to play the right way, play and be able to trust each other out there that everyone’s doing their job. I think we did a better job of that tonight.

> Yeah, I mean, I knew we were going to come back with an effort and we did. I think we had our forecheck going, we were on them, not giving them a lot of time and the forwards did a great job back checking, back pressure, it makes it easier for the defenseman. I think we were better all over the ice and we played as five.

> They pulled \[their goaltender] pretty early and when the other team pulls their goalie, it’s just a battle. We tried to be in position and whenever you have a chance to get into a battle, you try o win it, win the puck battle and get the puck out.

> Yeah, \[[[Pheonix Copley]]]’s been really solid, he’s really compact back there. He makes big saves at key times, so I think his calmness strengthened and it rubs off on everyone. I think he’s been great.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> I liked everything about it, compared to the Torontp effort, but a good response by the group as a whole. Whether you were an eight, nine minute man tonight or a 20 minute man, you were responsible for your game. I think we came to the rink and we trusted each other tonight, we didn’t do that in Toronto and it showed up on the ice. Put it behind us and move on, we’ll see what we have tomorrow.

> It ended up being the winner and anytime that happens, one, we get a little bit of a lift and it sets them back for a couple of minutes at least and buys you time. Obviously really important. I thought they had their fourth line out and that gave us a chance to play our fourth line and Lizzo did a really good job of winning the draw. That’s the value of a shot, you never know where it’s going to end up. \[[[Alex Edler]]] gets a goal so good for him.

> That’s getting back to our identity. I think anybody that has spent time around us when we’re playing well, that’s what we do. We a horrendous job in Toronto, and I keep going back to that game, but that’s where the reference point is right now. We did a much better job of it tonight.

> Well, \[[[Pheonix Copley]]]’s got us two wins, the team has played really well in front of him and that’s a good sign. It seems to me like we’re willing to take care of him, sometimes we don’t do that with the other goaltenders. I think he’s very calm and steady. The one that Caufield snuck by him, that can be a tough save sometimes, but I’m sure he’d like to have it back. Other than that, he was real solid.

> This game started 24 hours ago, at our non-practice yesterday. Sometimes not going on the ice is a good thing for the team. We addressed some things, we pointed a couple of things out and we used that word trust a lot. As a result, we saw a lot of that tonight.
