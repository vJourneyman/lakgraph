## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> It’s mass confusion right now for all of us and we better freaking figure it out quickly. Said Todd McLellan after the Los Angeles Kings' insane loss to the Seattle Kraken.

> The other side of the coin is that you score eight. It's a very, very confusing night for all of us. I'm really disappointed that we gave up nine goals. But on the other side, I'm glad that we fought back, got a point and scored eight.

> We lost this one as a team.

### [[Phillip Danault]]
> We got a big point though. We kept believing ourselves in the third. Although we were poor defensively, we got a big point.
