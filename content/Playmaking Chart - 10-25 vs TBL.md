## Summary
> Forum Report is very excited to bring you this feature, which will break simple possession statistics into a more nuanced understanding of who’s pushing the play towards the attacking net and how they’re doing it. It’s storytelling in chart form with some bullet points – a data-driven enhancement to what you saw the previous night. All statistics and commentary reflect the team’s five-on-five play.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Jaret Anderson-Dolan]]
> I thought my pace was good. They’ve been doing a good job with the skates here when I haven’t been playing, so my legs felt good. Mentally, I thought I was there, so I’m pretty happy with it.
