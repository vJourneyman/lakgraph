## Summary
> Good morning to you, Forum Club, and good morning, Bucktown.
> With the LA Kings scoring three and a half goals per game while bringing up the caboose in the Jennings Trophy race, it was fitting that November 2 was a 70-degree day in Chicago. Like the weather, there was no damper on the 30-somethings celebrating a kickball championship at 10 pm over yonder with beer showers.
