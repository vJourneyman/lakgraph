## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> There are a lot of areas, it’s just not consistent enough yet. Better defensively the last two games, penalty kill has improved, fewer trips to the penalty box, goaltending has got better as the nights have gone on. Coming back and doing it the right way, we were down 3-1 to Seattle and we took some penalties in the third, didn’t give ourselves a chance and in Nashville, we drew penalties, so there are a lot of positive signs.

> Identity is developed with a lot of characteristics that are unmeasurable. You can’t chart them, they don’t show up in the analytics too often and \[resilliancy] has to become part of the identity. After that, what do we look like while we’re doing it?

> All three of them, they’re all capable, they’re all veterans now in the league. None of them should feel uncomfortable playing in any situation, they have great experience, in fact, all of them should feel fairly confident right now. Arty had a real good bounce back game, he was engaged physically against a physical team, and all three of them have to pick up the clean-up responsibility of the defensive play, and they’re very capable.

> For Arthur, he’s got a tremendous skill set that he’s relied on his whole life and it’s very useful for our group and in the National Hockey League. But, there are other things that have to happen when you’re not in that situation, and we’re trying to get him to expand his game a little bit now that he’s played. It’s a good sign for him and for us if you noticed that.

### [[Quinton Byfield]]
> It’s the same mindset for me and G, but AI is a key piece to be missing for our team. He does everything, he can play anywhere in the lineup, but Arty is an amazing player as well. He’s super offensive, he has that shot, so we just have to find him and he’s going to bury it. He’s a great replacement.

> It’s just a good feeling to be out there, just being able to contribute on the play. Earning the coach’s trust to put us out there in a lot of different situations, luckily we scored that goal and I think it’s a big confidence booster for all of us. We’re all young guys here, and it’s just a trust factor there.

> Yeah, I think so, we’re playing later into games now. On the road, other teams can put their top lines against us and it’s not just taking us off, it’s trusting us against them, trusting that we can play against them and contribute against them. I think it’s definitely gone up a bunch.
