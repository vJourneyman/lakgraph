## Notes and Quotes
### [[Kevin Fiala]]
> I feel like we’ve controlled the game. We’re just playing 60 minutes over the last few games and it’s very nice to see. We just have to keep it up.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> \[[[Adrian Kempe]]] had numerous opportunities to score, I think he had two or three pieces of metal tonight. When you’re Adrian and you’re counted on, there are some expectations on you to score and finish. And when it’s not quite going well for you, you have to be able to put that aside and play all the other parts of the game.

> Sure, I’m gonna buy it now. We’ve talked about five chances, maybe, and two or three posts tonight. If he didn’t have that, we’d be going, ‘Man, Adrian’s not even creating anything.’ He’s creating, he’s getting looks, he’s getting opportunities and chances. Keep swinging the bat, and you’re going to hit the ball eventually.
