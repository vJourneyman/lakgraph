## Notes and Quotes
### [[Marco Sturm]]
> \[[[Jordan Spence]]] was outstanding, just like I know he can be.

> Spenny took over. He showed again that he’s an NHL defenseman and it was nice to see. I know his time will come, but we are very happy to have him, I can tell you that.

### [[Jordan Spence]]
> Obviously I wanted to make the Kings but it didn’t go my way out of training camp. But it’s good for me to just get a lot of minutes here, play in these situations that can help improve my game and it’s been going really well. Going into the regular season I just wanted to play my game, just showcase what I can do on the ice.

> There’s obviously still some things to improve on every game that you play, but I think Coach Hajt has been trusting me in more situations than last year with penalty kill and the last couple minutes in the third period. I think it’s really good for me to have that role and take a step up from last year.

> I think we’re just trying to be simple. If we’re up 3-2 and they’re just trying to score, you don’t have to make fancy plays and we don’t have to do anything fancy. If we’re in trouble, we just pump pucks, we chip pucks off the glass and everything, so I think that’s really important for us and Marco has mentioned that over the past few weeks.

> Having that experience last year, Helge and I came in more confident. Then picking up a couple of the players like \[Frederic] Allard and \[Tobie] Bisson, they’re really great players and I think it’s pretty easy for us to make plays with them. We just want to just keep doing what we’re doing because it’s been working so far.
