## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> I felt like we were going to go out and play well and I’m not just saying that. I felt good about our group. I think the last 48 hours, it was different, but it isn’t as dramatic as maybe I feel from the line of questioning.
> We’re not happy that \[[[Cal Petersen]]] is in Ontario right now, none of us are. We all take responsibility for that, but we’ve got to move on. The fact that \[General Manager [[Rob Blake]]] came in to talk to us, that happens.

> \[[[Kevin Fiala]]]’s got a tremendous skill set. His edges, his ability to slide off checks … I think it \[all] got enhanced in Minnesota with Kaprizov there, they have that same kind of shifty, on-the-edge, keep-plays-alive, change-of-pace \[qualities], and he’s got a hunger to score.

> I think the reason we have two units going is because we have two units going, if that makes any sense at all. One pushes the other. It used to be five guys would just stand up on the bench and just get ready to go, now 10 guys stand up and they wait for which unit’s going to go. That’s a great sign.
