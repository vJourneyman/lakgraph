## Summary
> For the most part, any time we use that phrase here it’s related to what the Kings as an organization are doing to help grow the game through the Kings brand. Over the next few days, that brand joins USA Hockey in advance of the Rivalry Series matchup at Crypto.com Arena on Monday evening. The women’s national teams from the United States and Canada will square off in Southern California in three-days time, however the event will be active beginning later this morning throughout the greater Los Angeles Area.
