## Summary
> A challenging opening two games at home have left the Kings at 0-2-0, after losses to Vegas and Seattle. For a team that entered the season with expectations to build and grow off of last season’s playoff berth, it’s not the start to the season that anyone had hoped for, though it’s also something that Todd McLellan warned us would be possible. With new expectations, comes a different type of season.

The team we should be comparing these Kings to is the team at the start of last season, not the one that ended it.

## Notes and Quotes
> As we go forward now, we’ll have to lay game two against game one because now we’re starting to get this year’s evidence. Maybe we’re going to be a loose, gambling, score five per night team and get it done that way, I don’t know, but that looked like how we wanted to play. If we feel as a group that’s where our identity has to go and we’re going to try it that way, great, but I’m not betting on it. We either reestablish who we are, or we try it a different way.   -- [[Todd McLellan]]

> We’re trying to figure out who we are, how do we want to play the game? For the media that was there this morning or yesterday, it doesn’t happen automatically, you get to recreate yourself every year. The reference point that we had after game one was last year, now we have six periods in the bag.  -- [[Todd McLellan]]
