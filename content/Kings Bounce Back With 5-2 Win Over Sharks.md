## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> It was a good recovery game. Obviously we weren’t pleased with the way things ended up against the Rangers. We had a couple of days to work on some things but it was a good road game. When that happens, usually all four lines are involved, all six defenseman, goaltending was solid. So team win.

> I couldn’t be happier for \[[[Jaret Anderson-Dolan]] and his linemates]. That line played their best game of the season together. They were firm, they were hard, they won a lot of puck battles. \[[[Arthur Kaliyev]]] was physical, he stripped a lot of pucks, fed those players. \[[[Rasmus Kupari]]] won faceoffs, JAD obviously worked his butt off and scored. Many elements that are needed for success as a line, I think we saw that constantly from those three. They should all feel really good about themselves and should be prepared to do it again on Sunday.
