## Summary
> In the 2021-22 NHL season, the most significant discussion point for the LA Kings was the lack of success on the powerplay. Fans recalled how the LA Kings failed to tally goals on what was supposed to be the advantage. The LA Kings’ powerplay has looked slightly better this year than last season. But it still isn’t perfect.
