## Notes and Quotes
### [[Trevor Moore]]
> It was kind of funny, I didn't feel like I had my best tonight. It was just kind of one of those games where the puck finds you, or I should say my linemates found me, so it was good to get those bounces out there.

> If you try to work hard every night and try to bring it, you're going to get rewarded.

### [[Viktor Arvidsson]]
> Going up against two of the best players in the world was fun, and it's a challenge. I think we embraced it really well and worked hard and got rewarded.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> That's why you don't quit coming back. You never know what can happen, but good for 'Arvy'.

> \[[[Trevor Moore]]]'s been there all year for us, offensively. Just hasn't gone in a lot for him. I haven't looked lately, but I know he was leading us in shots on goal, which means he is around the net a lot.
