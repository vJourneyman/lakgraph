## Summary
> The season-long shuffle continues for the Kings.  In an effort to bank extra cap space, the team has been shuffling waiver-exempt players to AHL Ontario on off days.  Today, that trend continues as the team announced that they’ve assigned center Lias Andersson and defenseman Jacob Moverare to the Reign.  In doing so, the team drops out of using LTIR and will be able to bank at least a little bit of cap room in advance of tomorrow’s game against Ottawa when one or both will likely be recalled.
