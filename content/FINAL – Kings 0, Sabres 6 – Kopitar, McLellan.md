## Notes and Quotes
### [[Anze Kopitar]]
> The effort was there for the first 40 and then unnecessary penalties obviously. PK goals against. On the flip side, we couldn’t get anything going on the powerplay either.

> Yeah, obviously it’s not ideal, whichever way you take penalties. We’ve got to find a way to avoid them.

> I don’t know if I can pinpoint anything specifically, but the bottom line is we got to figure it out and not allow that to happen.

> You want to finish a road trip with a win. As very average as this trip has been going, we can still go home with a .500 record. So, we’ll do whatever we’ve got to do tomorrow to get ready for Thursday and then we’ll try to win a hockey game.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Well, it played a huge part in the game. We took six penalties in the last half of the game, a lot of them in succession, only one in our zone. So, that tells you enough about our game.

> Responsibility, carelessness. The goal that they scored right after, we’re in a two-man forecheck and guys lose their man. We’ve been talking about it all year, so no I can’t explain it.

> Penalties. Penalties, it’s as simple as that.

> It doesn’t matter, we didn’t have it in the third. We gave up six goals in the third period, five of them came after the 10-minute mark, that’ll tell you enough.
