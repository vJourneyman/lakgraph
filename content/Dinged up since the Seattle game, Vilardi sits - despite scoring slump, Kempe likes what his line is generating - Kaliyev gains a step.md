## Summary
> The LA Kings never played with a lead in a 3-2 overtime loss to the Ottawa Senators that again illustrated the micro and macro inconsistencies they’ve been unable to iron out of their game.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Adrian Kempe]]
> We didn’t play quick enough. Obviously there was a (Clippers) game earlier today, so the ice wasn’t going to be as it good as it usually is. We didn’t keep it as simple as we wanted to. We tried to make hard plays, and they were just grinding it out, and I thought they had a way better first period than we did.

> It’s one thing if the team wins and you’re having chances and you feel like still contributed some way. But when you don’t score obviously you get frustrated. Our line the last three, four, five games, it’s been as many chances as we can get, and I thought we played a really solid game tonight.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Between the first and second we had to have a little talk about how we were playing. We had to change our game. It wasn’t working, and I thought we adapted. We took it up a notch in the second, certainly a notch again in the third, got it to overtime.

> There’s a good chance we knew about \[[[Gabe Vilardi]]] after the Seattle game.

> I think you only have to look at number eight in Washington to see how that works. I’m not saying that \[[[Arthur Kaliyev]]]’s Ovechkin by \[any] means. Maybe later on in his career he’ll get there. But they both have that element of a shot from that spot – obviously different hands – and you have to respect it, and then it opens up ice for others.

### [[Arthur Kaliyev]]
>  Skating, maybe, and trying to be more physical on the forecheck or finishing more hits. I want to do more of that, and I think I’ve gotten a bit faster than I was at training camp.
