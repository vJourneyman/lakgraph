### [[Quinton Byfield]]
> It was unbelievable. We were staying on the bench for ‘O Canada.’ You look up. The whole crowd is wearing orange. Singing ‘O Canada.’ You actually had goosebumps in there. How loud it was.
> 
> You watched it all growing up. Stanley Cup playoffs. To be one of the 16 teams left, it was really exciting. I’m looking forward to being back there every other year.

> I look at it like it’s kind of a good thing for me as well. I’m getting to know all the younger prospects as well. They said they want me to have a leadership role here. I kind of look forward to that and progress in my career with that leadership role as well.
> 
> I’m looking at it like that and I see a lot of positive this weekend. Just play a couple games before training camp and before the season. Get the feel before. Maybe have a step on everyone else and be in game shape.

> I had the whole short side. I don’t know if I whiffed or it just bounced over my stick or whatever. No, it definitely sucks. You want to score. I think the goalie had my number this game as well. He made a lot of saves on me.

> I just feel more confident in just holding onto pucks. Protection. Just more confident in the corners. And just being at home. Just working with a lot of other pros. Really good players. Just being able to do the protection against them and just keep up to their level. Definitely playing with quite a bit of confidence.

> I feel like confidence is a huge thing is hockey and just in sports as well. If you have that, you have the swagger to make any play. You walk around just with confidence. I feel like I lost that a little bit last year.
> 
> I wasn’t really playing like how I know I’ve played and how I’ve played my whole life growing up. I feel good now and I feel confident again. I just want to continue that into the season.

### [[Marco Sturm]]
> It’s very important to have a guy like him in the lineup and having him around too, all weekend. I think he already is taking charge on the ice and off the ice. And I think it’s just going to help him as a hockey player and as a person. I’m very pleased that he’s around.

> I thought he was our best forward. I know he didn’t score and didn’t have a point. But he’s good. He’s very demanding. And he should be. If not, then we’re in trouble.
> 
> But I got to say he came in really good shape. He worked really hard this summer. I can tell. We can all tell. Hopefully he’s going to grab that spot with the Kings and make that next step.
