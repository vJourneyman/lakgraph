## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> I don’t think we should lose sight of how this game evolved. Just because we fought back and made it 6-5, there are a lot of things that we have to fix.

### [[Phillip Danault]]
> Our start has got to be better. Defensively, we have to be better, move the puck quicker and we have to get open. All-around game, I think (has to improve).
