## Summary
> If you’ve spent enough time in dressing rooms and at press conferences, you’ve heard a few times that “A-game” performances are required every night to win in the NHL, part of the salary cap-point system complex that groups large swaths of clubs into varying degrees of middle or upper-middle class competitive status. Are the Vancouver Canucks part of that middle or upper-middle class? Up for debate! But Los Angeles’ B-performance at Rogers Arena, a confluence of a committed opponent rallying for an embattled and talented goaltender, and a visiting performance whose purpose could have been good enough to win in some circumstances but dropped significantly from Edmonton, led to a multi-goal deficit in which L.A. was stung on the counterattack and became the first opponent unable to put at least three pucks past Thatcher Demko.
