## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> This game started 24 hours ago at our non-practice yesterday (Friday). Sometimes not going on the ice is a good thing for a team, but it wasn’t an empty day. We addressed some things, we pointed a couple of things out, and we used the word trust a lot. And as a result we saw a lot of that today.

> Tomorrow’s task, win or lose, is the same. The energy level, we’re going to have to find some. We’re going to have to play a smart game but they’re points in the bank that nobody can take away from you. And after the effort in Toronto the response was the big thing and getting the points was the icing on the cake.
> But we’ve got to put it behind us and get on this plane and get ready to play again tomorrow.

> That’s getting back to our identity. I think that anybody that has spent time around us when we’re playing well that’s what we do, and we did a horrendous job in Toronto. I know I keep going back to that game but that’s what our reference point is right now and we did a much better job of it tonight.

> The team has played really well in front of \[[[Pheonix Copley]]], that’s a good sign. It seems to me like we’re willing to take care of him. Sometimes we don’t do that with the other goaltenders. And I think he’s very calm and steady. You know the one that (Cole) Caufield snuck by him, that can be a tough save sometimes. I’m sure he’d like to have that back. But other than that he was real solid.

> They’re a very dangerous power play. The number that they present to stats people, it can be real deceiving. We saw that in the pre-scout and they created a number of chances, so to alleviate the pressure and get it down ice and get fresh guys out, it helped us.

### [[Kevin Fiala]]
> The most important thing right now is to do it next game again. We have kind of up-and-down games so we’re just trying to find consistency right now.

### [[Phillip Danault]]
> I think we weren’t satisfied at all with our last game, and that wasn’t acceptable. So our first 20 minutes was huge tonight, which we did, and a full 60 minutes followed. So it was really good from everyone tonight.
