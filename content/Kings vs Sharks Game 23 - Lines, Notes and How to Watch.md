## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> It reminds us that they're human beings that play the game. They make mistakes and those times of year, Thanksgiving and Christmas especially. You have a chance to sit back and realize, as coaches, you're riding a horse and you're probably whipping it all the time. Sometimes you've got to let it breathe a little bit too. They're human beings, they make mistakes, they don't always feel good, they're not perfect but we do appreciate what they do. And the effort they give the organization and the fans.
