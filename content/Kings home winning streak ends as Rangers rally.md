## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Our game tonight matched our year, where we’re inconsistent and we’re up and down. Whether it’s within a game or two-game segments … we’re still searching

> Cal has to make that save. Cal made some outstanding saves. (But) sometimes it’s the one that you need rather than all the ones you made that makes the difference in the game, and we needed that one.

### [[Viktor Arvidsson]]
> It was just desperation. I think we did a good job keeping the puck out of the net at that time. Cal made a good save on the first one, we scrambled and got it done, then we scored right after. It was a big momentum goal, but then they scored on the next shift.
