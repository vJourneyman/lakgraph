## Notes and Quotes
### [[Aidan Dudas]]
> I think we need to find more consistency as a team. We kind of started off slow, gave up a few odd man rushes. But we know we have the ability in our room. We have the talent, the skill, the players to win every game.I think it just comes down to being mentally prepared.
