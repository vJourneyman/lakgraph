## Summary
> Given the neverending supply of netminder-centric narratives flooding every arena so far in 2022-23, it felt fitting to revise this columnâ€™s initially static approach. Rather than needlessly delaying an NHL Goalie Report, and waiting weeks for additional storylines to compile, you can now expect the latest and most important headlines to be presented in a much more fluid fashion the rest of the way.
