## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> We talked about fixing some things after the Dallas game (a 5-2 loss on Tuesday). We saw it today. \[We] did a real good job of it, gave up very few outnumbered rushes. We were pretty solid defensively, good through the neutral zone. We did a lot of things well tonight. We didn't get the win. Sometimes bounces go against you, and that's what happened to \[Fiala] in front of the net. I didn't think we had as much polish as we've shown offensively.

### [[Blake Lizotte]]
> I think as of late my line specifically has been struggling on the defensive end of it. Our focus now is just playing simple, smart hockey. When you can get pucks to go in, it's always nice.
> We kind of started the year scoring a lot but also giving up a lot. I think our team is starting to turn around where we play a little more defensive hockey, which I think most Kings fans are used to and most Kings players are used to. I think that's actually a good sign for us, that we're in these 1-1 games versus 6-5 shootouts. I think it's more our style and what our identity is and what we want to be.
