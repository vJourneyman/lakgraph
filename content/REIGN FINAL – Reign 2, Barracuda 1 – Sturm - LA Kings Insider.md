## Notes and Quotes
### [[Marco Sturm]]
> It was definitely our best period. It’s been our best period pretty much all season long. I think guys are really confident now going into the third, especially with the lead. So that showed again today. We probably didn’t play our best hockey today, but you know what, we’re going home with two points against a very good hockey team.

> It shouldn’t be like this every time when \[[[Pheonix Copley]]]’s in net. I know he saved us again, but we just got to make sure that we’re better. Better prepared, better in the first period too, because he is. He’s a perfect example and he’s leading the way every time he plays so we just have to make sure we were on his boat every time he plays this well.

> Special teams is always a big key and today we lost special teams and it’s not because of the PK, it was because of the power play. We never really got momentum out of it and I think they created even more chances than we did on the power play so that has to be better. I give them credit. They played a good PK, but you can’t get frustrated and once in a while you have to get it in deep too and work for it and we just didn’t do it. That’s something we would definitely have to address moving forward.

> \[[[Alan Quine]]]’s smart and very skilled, a very likeable player. He’s been really solid for us. That’s what we need from him and I know he had a tough year last year and over the last couple of years, but I feel like he feels comfortable. I also think even he can be better too. I know it always looks good points-wise, but he’s definitely going in the right direction and we’re just happy to have him.
