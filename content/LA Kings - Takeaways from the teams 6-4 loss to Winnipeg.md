## Notes and Quotes
- Puck Possession Period
  > 12% of our schedule is gone, and we still don’t know how we want to play. I would think the experiment of run and gun that we’re trying to play, like how much more evidence do we need that it doesn’t work. There are simple hockey principles, you don’t turn pucks over at the line, you get pucks in deep, you forecheck, short shifts. The penalties that we’re taking are unacceptable, so there’s a lot of game management situations that go into it, and unless the group decides as a whole, we’ll experiment for another ten games.
 > Maybe we will become the run-and-gun team. I don’t like our chances, but if that’s how we want to play and that’s what we’re going to keep trying, we’re probably going to keep getting the same results. -- [[Todd McLellan]]
- Defensive Lapses Continue
  > The first one, stuff like that happens, and we were still going, we scored three goals, and then we proceeded to give up a shorthanded goal. That should not happen.
  > It’s just playing more responsible. -- [[Anze Kopitar]]
- First Line in Flux
  > Gabe has been probably our best offensive player. There are some things going on with Kopi’s line that I’m not happy with, and I thought that that Gabe needed an opportunity there. \[…] What we have right now isn’t working, so we’ll have to address it tomorrow. -- [[Todd McLellan]]
