## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Teams that have that element of a shot from there, that can score from distance or just powered by goaltender, you have to respect it and it can open up space for other players. If you don’t have it, they can cheat. They don’t have to worry so much about that side. I think you only have to look at number eight in Washington to see how that works. I’m not saying that Arthur is Ovechkin by no means, maybe later on his career he’ll get there, but they both have that element of a shot from that spot. Obviously different hands, but you have to respect it and opens up ice for others.
