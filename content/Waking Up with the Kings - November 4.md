## Summary
> The Meet Joe Black of the 2022-23 season, Thursday’s 2-1 overtime loss in Chicago to finish a 1-1-1 trip was the type of uninteresting structural rebar demonstrating a broad step forward in necessary defensive rectifications while also testing Alex, Jim, Nick and Daryl’s endurance to pull blood from a dull, motionless stone. Did I mention the game was dull?

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> He’s starting to figure out our system and our structure a little bit more, so he’s a hell of a player.

> The NHL’s all about winning games, and they all balance out at the end. I thought tonight we might’ve deserved a better fate, but we didn’t get it. The ‘progress’ part was one that we’re not happy with – but we’re pleased to see process.

### [[Kevin Fiala]]
> We just have to find a way to play 60 minutes great – defensively, offensively – and try to find ways to win games.
