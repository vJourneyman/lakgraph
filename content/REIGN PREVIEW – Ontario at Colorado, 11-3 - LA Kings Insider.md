## Summary
> The Ontario Reign play outside of California for the first time this season Thursday night to open a two-game series in Colorado against the Eagles. The team’s furthest road trip to date is a rematch of last season’s second-round Calder Cup Playoff series that saw Colorado pull off a three-game sweep to advance to the Pacific Division Finals where they then fell to the Stockton Heat. Ontario comes into the matchup having won its last five games, while Colorado recently split a weekend pair of games against Henderson, but has lost three of their last four overall. The Reign finished with a 2-3-1-0 record in six contests against the Eagles during the 2021-22 regular season.
