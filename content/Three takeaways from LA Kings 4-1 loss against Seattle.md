## Summary
> The LA Kings' go pointless on their two-game mini-homestand and start the season 0-2-0 for the first time since 2016-17.


## Notes and Quotes
1) [[Brandt Clarke]]
   NHL debut. Only Kings defenseman not to finish with a minus.
2) Martin Jones
3) 1-5-1
   That was the Kings record across the first 7 games last year, and they still finished in the playoffs.

> We have some work to do. We’re not playing a full 60 minutes, we’re sloppy with passes and the details and we have to capitalize as well. It’s not that we’re not trying, we tried really hard today, but it’s not enough. We’ve got to start better. -- [[Phillip Danault]]
