## Summary
> After watching the Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Rams stagger through another poor offensive performance in Tampa Bay that puts their playoffs hopes on thin ice, it may be time for Sean McVay to reach out to a coaching staff whose team is clicking on all offensive cylinders just up the 110 from Sofi Stadium. 
> Though Todd McLellan and his crew can’t give advice on blocking schemes or play calling, there’s something in the ice at Crypto.com Arena these days that has the Los Angeles Kings producing at a clip not seen in years around downtown.
