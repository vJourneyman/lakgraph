## Summary
> Hockey teams typically take on an identity, and each season new characteristics of a particular team may emerge. If the 2022-23 Kings are anything at this point, it’s consistent. Through the first 29 games, they seem to trade wins and losses back and forth on a fairly regular basis. With two games down in a six-game road trip, coach Todd McLellan’s team now sits at 14-11-4 in the Pacific Division standings.
