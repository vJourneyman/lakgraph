## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> We have to find our lineup based on our reaction to the game and how we dealt with it yesterday (Friday). So we made the decision that we’re prepared to give that group a chance after our meeting yesterday to try and turn it around.

> Well \[[[Pheonix Copley]]] was very calm and quiet. I liked the way our team played so that’s always easier for a goaltender to play in that situation. The Toronto game our team was horrendous, did nothing to help [[Jonathan Quick]] out. But the fact that the team played well in front of Copley and he played very calm, very big, managed the game well – he’s an older goaltender that’s been around a while, we like that, he got the win, so he gets another opportunity.

> Well, when we acquired \[[[Phillip Danault]]] what we thought we were getting, we got. And there’s a whole other package that came along with it. And I’m sure the people here in Montreal and Habs fans appreciate his defending and ability to shut people down. We’ve seen that consistently for the last year and a half but there’s so much more to him. 
> We’ve been able to see his offensive acumen is at a very high level. His ability to, well, win faceoffs but win puck battles. He uses his body position really well. He’s really strong on his edges, a good stick. There’s a lot of time we’re finding video clips of him doing those things and using them in teaching situations for our younger players. And some leadership skills that we thought were there, we didn’t know how he would react when he entered a new locker room. Sometimes it takes a while but he fit right in and he’s got tremendous leadership skills.



### [[Phillip Danault]]
> I’m always very happy to come back to this beautiful city. My family is here too, they’re coming, so it’s always a happening, if you will, to come back to this building.

> I’m not surprised. \[Nick Suzuki]’s an excellent player and right from the start, when I was there, you saw that his attitude was different and the maturity was there. So I’m not surprised he was named captain and I would have done the same thing. I’m not surprised about his offensive production either. He’s a competitor and I’m really happy for him.
