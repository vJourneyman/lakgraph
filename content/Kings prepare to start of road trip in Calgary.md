## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> You can pretty much count on \[[[Anze Kopitar]]] to do that. He’s been our best faceoff guy. We want him in those situations. He is calm and, you know what? He is so strong. When it’s time to defend, he gets it done.

> These guys won championships because they sacrificed. They gave up offense, they did what other teams didn’t want to do in the past. And we still have some of that in the room. Drew and Quickie and Kopi, they have to give and give and give so that the team can win.

> How can you not respect Darryl and the family? The Sutters, I’ve known them for years, played with some of them and coached against all of them. But I’m a fan of his press conferences, he does a real good job of, um, answering questions, I think.

### [[Sean Durzi]]
> I think to have Dewey on that side is a positional change, where we can use his great shot now. And to have Juice up top, with the hands it all works out, having a one-timer on both sides. We have all good enough players that they can play anywhere on the power play.
