## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> That’s the best I’ve seen Sammy play this year.

> We were really hoping he’d be here full-time. He didn’t have the camp that we anticipated he would and I’m sure for him too so hats off to him for having an impact.

> I felt bad for him on the one that he had earlier when he hit the post. It was that close. Sammy’s arrived and I thought he had a good, strong game. It was great to see our bench; we were losing, but they’re really excited for him so that’s the sign of a good close team.

> It’s one of the most confusing things that all players have. You have to have a ‘B’ game that you can bring, because the odds of you scoring and being real effective offensively right off the bat night after night aren’t as great as they would be if you played against teenagers.

### [[Samuel Fagemo]]
> I think it’s really important to learn and adapt to that role. I think I can do both the roles well so I’ve just got to be focused on doing my role as well as I can.

> I think here I’ve just got to stay focused for every shift and opportunity I get on the ice. That’s the biggest thing for me.

### [[Marco Sturm]]
> \[[[Samuel Fagemo]]] cares and he competes every night. Everyone catches that and that’s why players deserve to be up there. Having that role on the fourth line and just having a working mindset coming into it with the big boys, maybe that’s something they needed so that’s why it was the right choice.

> You’re just not allowed to have too many mistakes in a game. It’s not like the AHL, where there’s a lot more mistakes taken from everyone, it doesn’t matter who it is. Up there, not so much. Those little mistakes could cost you a goal and maybe even an entire game too. Players still have to play their own way, they’re going to work hard and we know that, but they’ve got to be smart, try not to make too many mistakes and keep it simple.
