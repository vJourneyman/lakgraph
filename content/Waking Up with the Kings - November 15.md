## Summary
> In a stark contrast to the robust forechecking and ability to quickly diagnose and repair its elements in their recent home stand, the LA Kings plunged back into early season abysses of puck management, game management, chance-trading and leaving their goaltender alone to fend off the 1986 Argentina World Cup team in a flattering 6-5 defeat.
