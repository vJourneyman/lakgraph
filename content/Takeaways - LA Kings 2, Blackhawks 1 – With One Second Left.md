## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> There are a lot of similarities \[…] We didn’t have to kill as many penalties in Chicago as we did here, and obviously, with the quality of some of their players on that powerplay, they can make you pay, so that was the major difference in the game. The way it rolled out, the overtime, the score – a lot of similarities.

### 100 career points for Moore

### Goaltenders Duel
### [[Phillip Danault]]
> We were playing better, and they were fresh; they only had one game in 4-5 days, so it was a big two points for us, huge. Their goalie was really good today, but so was \[[[Jonathan Quick]]], so I think it was an outstanding job all around.

### Kevin Fia-LA!
### [[Kevin Fiala]]
> It was a really tight game from both teams; both goaltenders played unbelievable. That was kind of like a playoff game, and it’s nice that we’ve won.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> They entered the zone, and what was good about the entry is that Phil’s a left-handed shot, and he could pull the puck back across his body and kind of cross and protect it as it went. He had another lefty with him, so the side of the ice that we came in on was valuable to us. We could go lateral; he made a real good play and still had a lefty over on the outside for the rebound.
> I think that’s game management, that’s awareness, and they also knew the time on the clock, so there was no fooling around. As soon as the puck went out to Kevin, he knew he had to shoot it, and he made it count. That’s how I saw that play evolve; a lot of it had to do with hands and the side of the ice that we entered on.
