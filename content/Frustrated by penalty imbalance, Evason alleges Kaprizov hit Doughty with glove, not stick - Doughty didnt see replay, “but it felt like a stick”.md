## Summary
> Despite settling back into the staid, structured hockey often associated with the series, he Kings-Wild game Tuesday night at Crypto.com Arena still provided an unexpected, unique moment on which the game hinged: superstar Kirill Kaprizov was given a second period match penalty for his two-handed stick chop to Drew Doughty’s face.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Drew Doughty]]
> I don’t think he hit me with his glove. I’m not positive, I didn’t see a replay, but it felt like a stick. I mean, the intent I’m pretty sure was with the stick. … I played him hard right before he did it, so he was frustrated, and it happens.

> I played him hard right before that, even \[I maybe] crossed the line a little bit. But he’s their best player and you need to play him hard. It was an advantage for us to get him out of the game, big time.

### [[Jonathan Quick]]
> Caught him in the face and he’s bleeding, so it’s at least a double-minor.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> I’m not too sure that one of the top 10 players in the league wants to leave the game with intention. I don’t think that was Kaprizov’s intent at all. Whether his emotions got a hold of him or not, I don’t think that’s the case in that situation.
