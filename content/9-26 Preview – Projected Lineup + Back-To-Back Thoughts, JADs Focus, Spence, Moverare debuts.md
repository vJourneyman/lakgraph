## Summary
> The Kings will complete a preseason-opening back-to-back set this evening as they visit the Vegas Golden Knights at T-Mobile Arena.


## Notes and Quotes
### [[Lias Andersson]]
>  It was fun. It was a different game, a lot of penalties, so there was no rhythm in the first two periods. A little different, but I think we stood up pretty well In the first period, we struggled a bit with penalties and then we started moving our feet a little bit more and in the second and third, I think we should be pretty happy with it.

> It’s been five games here in five days \[between camp scrimmages and exhibition games]. I’m just trying to do the best with it, do my stuff in the gym and make sure that I’m ready to play.



### [[Brandt Clarke]]
> Yeah, it was definitely not a standard flow, back and forth kind of game. They had a lot of pressure in the first period because we were killing the whole time and we had a lot of pressure in the second period because we were on the man advantage. That definitely gave our special teams guys a lot of practice and our kill was amazing, we barely gave them any shots, but our power play was definitely generating get some good shots off but unfortunately we didn’t bury any of them. 

> With those three inter-squad games, and now two games in a row, it’s definitely going to be tiring after tonight, but they just want to see my consistency, that’s why they’re throwing me in there. I’m going to rise to the occasion, I’m not going to sit back or anything, I’m still going to play my game. I feel fine and I’m going to be ready to go.

### [[Jaret Anderson-Dolan]]
> Yeah, definitely. I think for everyone, no matter what spot you’re in, for the guys that have been here, it’s getting your timing back and getting your game legs back and getting ready for the regular season. For guys that are competing for jobs, it’s just an opportunity to prove yourself, so I’m definitely excited.

> Puck possession and protecting pockets was the big focus this summer. It’s something they talked about with me at my exit meeting and I think I’ve gotten a little bit better at it over the summer. Now, it’s just translating that into my game and these preseason games.

### [[Jordan Spence]]
> I think it just comes with the experience from last season. Luckily for me, I played 24 games, so for me to have that experience, I just want to bring that into camp and showcase what I can bring. I think I’m more confident this year, and it’s my goal to make the team, so we’ll see how it goes.

> I only had one game \[at the Rookie Faceoff], but to have that five on five game, that pace, it got me a little bit more prepared than maybe the other guys, because I’m just used to fast play. I think it was good for me to come into main camp and have all of that conditioning.

> No one’s perfect, everyone makes mistakes, but I think it’s just the guys who bounce back and become better with that. For me, I know what I have to do to become a better player, I know my weaknesses. I’m just trying to do the best I can to fix those \[during camp] and go from there in the future.
