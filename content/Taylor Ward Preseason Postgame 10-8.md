the environment here

first game of the year and we look
forward to the season starting all
summer so it's good to get out there
with the guys

better I thought we were a little bit
sloppy there
but you know it's the first game we got
a week now to dial in and then it's
regular season so we'll get there

of special teams how tough is that to
play you know your first game with this

I mean I think that's pretty typical
first game of the season everybody's you

get a bit Chippy at times so a lot of
special teams but we're going to face
that in the regular season too so
something to get used to I think

excited to get the regular season going

have worked on in The Limited practice
time you've had as a as a group what are
some of the things that that Marco's

touched on a lot of things
um systematically but mostly Marco just
wants us to go out there and you know
give it our all you know play with Pace
play with uh with work ethic and really
enjoy the Kings and the Reign mentalities
go fast and strong and hard so that's
what we're trying to do and uh
just look where they're getting out
there on one Friday and doing it for
real 

> Q: play with [[Akil Thomas||Akil]] a little bit
here what's it like kind of playing with
him obviously a guy who has a really
good amount of talent
> A: yeah he's a great player obviously he's
on that pass there in the third he's
made a great play he plays his speed he
can shoot the bunk and he can pass so he
open plays playing with him as my
centerman for sure
