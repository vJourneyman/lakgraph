## Notes and Quotes
### [[Brandt Clarke]]
> I’m letting things take care of themselves. I’m still doing video with the coaches; I still feel part of the team. So, I’m just going day by day, enjoying my experience right now, the ‘welcome to the NHL’ kind of time. I’m really happy with how everything is, I’m happy to be on this team and we’re going to just keep going from here.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> He’s a good liar. The fact that we keep using him, and putting him out in all situations … we believe in him or we wouldn’t be doing that. The organization has to sit down and make decisions on what’s right for him, for us, for the future, for now.”
> If he keeps worrying about just the next day, pretty soon it’s gonna be June next year and he’ll be flying home

> For us to move forward as an organization – today, tomorrow or two years from now – it has to come from underneath. We’d love to have Dustin Brown back and Kopi forever and Drew Doughty and Quickie, but that’s Mother Nature. She wins all the time, she’s going to beat all of us. It has to come from the youth underneath.
