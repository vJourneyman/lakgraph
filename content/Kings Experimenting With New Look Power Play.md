## Summary
> Seven years. It's been seven years since the Los Angeles Kings finished a season with a league-average power play. The 2016-17 season saw them finish 15th out of 30 teams with a 19.09% power play. The 2016-17 season was Darryl Sutter and Dean Lombardi's last. [[Adrian Kempe]]'s rookie season and the only season in the last 15 years that Anze Kopitar didn't lead the team in points. We're talking about a long time ago.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> No, if you think about our power play in the past, we've moved guys all over the place. I believe good power plays are like that, everyone is interchangeable, it's unpredictable. And in fact, by experiencing somebody else's spot, you can understand what may happen in that situation. Adrian had been back there last year too. So, sometimes it's about hands, sometimes it's about opposition. I don't know if we're going to use it again, we'll see.

### [[Adrian Kempe]]
> I haven't played it (the point) since I came into this league. I used to do it when I was younger, when I was 16-17, I played it a lot but not since. But I've always liked to play there. I think it's more of a threat having two one-timer out there at the same time so that helps too.
