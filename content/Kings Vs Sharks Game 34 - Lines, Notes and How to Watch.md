## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> \[[[Jordan Spence]]'s] strengths are puck movement and vision. He executes well, he's got some offensive instincts. What did he need to work on (in Ontario)? Well, size and strength. He's not going to grow much more but he can get stronger and he's done that over the summer. Some of that is evident in his ability to defend in and around the net at the American League level, that's improved. That's an area we asked him to take care of and he's done that.

> Right now, he (Copley) feels confident, he looks confident and he makes us feel confident. So, he'll play tonight.

### [[Jordan Spence]]
> When I was with the Reign I wanted to work on all sides of the game. Especially defensively, I think just playing every game and getting feedback from [[Chris Hajt]]; just improving on what I can do to be a better player. And I think it's been going well so far, so I just want to keep that going here with the Kings.
