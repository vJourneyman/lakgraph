## Notes and Quotes
### [[Gabe Vilardi]]
>Getting my body ready to play, that’s the main thing I learned in L.A.. I know more about doing a lot of activation stuff, before a practice, before a game. Making sure you’re firing the right muscles, that you’re not overusing your back, that your glutes (gluteal muscles) and core are activated. I’ve brought it here to Kingston and it helps a lot.

>I was in L.A. the whole summer with one of the best staffs I’ve ever worked with. It was really tough some days, like the first few weeks. One day you’d feel strength coming back; the next day you’re really tired. It’s much better, I’m finding much more consistency in my game. I’ve been through injuries before and it’s a process. 

> They got me here to score goals and make plays in the offensive zone. I’m just trying to play my game, whatever that involves on any given night.

> We have some really skilled hockey players here. Three good lines almost every night, good defence, (Carolina Hurricanes draft choice Jeremy) Helvig in goal. It’s just a matter of developing chemistry, getting to know each other a little more, like when we spend time on the road.

> Being here I get to stay with my family, which is great. I left when I was 14 and that was tough. I know not too many people get the opportunity to play junior hockey in their hometown and I’m having fun so far.
