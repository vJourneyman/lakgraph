## Summary
> Ontario fell to the Bakersfield Condors Sunday evening by a 3-2 score. The high-powered Reign offense that was on display Friday night was largely silent just two days later, as only Sammy Fagemo was able to find the back of the net â€” although he did it twice, both times off of assists from T.J. Tynan and Lias Andersson.
