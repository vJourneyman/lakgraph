## Summary

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Marco Sturm]]
> I think, first of all, the opponent was a little different. They just a played a totally different game. Structurally they weren’t pretty, but they got the job done. They know they’re roles. They knew what they wanted to do, hey frustrated us a little bit five-on-five, and they wanted to score on the powerplay, and that’s exactly what they did.

> He was pretty good. I thought him and Tynan had a really good game. With his shot, he’s so dangerous at five-on-five and five-on-four. Now, we have to find a way to get many more shots like that. He was good today, and he needs to be. Our best players have to be the best players every night, and today we didn’t have enough.

> We’re not going to win every game. There will be games when we’re going to be behind. Like today, we tied it up and then I thought we felt really good and the bench was alive. It was a little quiet before we had good momentum. Then, all of a sudden, we got the goal against. A bad bounce, maybe bad luck, but it doesn’t matter. That’s something we just have to get better at and we have to learn from it and use it for the next game.

> I thought he was really solid. There’s still maybe one or two goals he might want back, but you can tell he’s a veteran goalie. We’re really lucky and we’re very happy to have him in there because he will give us a chance every night to win the hockey game.
