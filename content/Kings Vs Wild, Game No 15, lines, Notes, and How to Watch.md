## Summary
> The Los Angeles Kings (7-6-1) have made a habit of high-scoring games. Averaging over three goals for, and against per game the LA Kings have been nothing if not entertaining.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Phillip Danault]]
> Our last practice was what, over a week ago?. We definitely feel good and obviously after a win too. We want to fix a couple of things, we know we havenâ€™t been bad but we got to be better with system details, things like that. So, it obviously felt good to practice.
