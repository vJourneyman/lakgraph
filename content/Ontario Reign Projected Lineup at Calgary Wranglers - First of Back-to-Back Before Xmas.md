## Summary
> While this week’s back-to-back set will be the first games ever played in Calgary by the Reign, it won’t be the first time Ontario has played the Wranglers franchise. After setting up shop in Stockton (as the Heat) during the AHL’s initial push to California, the NHL’s Flames relocated their top minor league affiliate closer to home for the 2022-23 campaign. Along with a new address, the team signed former Reign captain Brett Sutter over the summer, as well. Tuesday night will mark his first matchup vs. his old club.
