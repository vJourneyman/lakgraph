## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> If that’s how we want to play and that’s what we’re going to keep trying, we’re probably going to keep getting the same results.

### [[Anze Kopitar]]
> You’re still up one but you certainly don’t want to give up anything. In our minds we should be extending our lead versus giving up shorties
