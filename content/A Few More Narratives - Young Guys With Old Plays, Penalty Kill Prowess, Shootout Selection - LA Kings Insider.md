## Summary
> Last night’s recap was actually one of the shortest ones of the year, and much of that stemmed down to a race against the clock. We got it up and out, and that’s that, but in the process, a few important narratives were missed, so I’d like to share those now and dive in with a little bit of additional detail.




## Players
- [[Gabe Vilardi]]
- [[Quinton Byfield]]
- [[Brandt Clarke]]
- [[Matt Roy]]
- [[Cal Petersen]]

## Notes and Quotes
- Young Players, Veteral Plays
  > I think guys like Gabe and Quinton have to take more of that on, when we started running penalty killing tonight, we had Gabe and Q out in a 4-on-4 situation. As they continue to evolve as young players and continue to play well, they get more and their confidence level should be really high right now.
- Killing It
  > I thought we had some good goaltending and I think guys were selling out and blocking shots. -- [[Matt Roy]]
  
  > The goalie made saves and he got us whistles when we needed. The stands and the retrievals were pretty good tonight. In zone, we had some big blocks, I thought we were smart when penalty killing overtime, 4-on-3. We gave up some shots but they weren’t cross court shots and execution was pretty good. -- [[Todd McLellan]]
  
  > It just starts with blocking shots and getting our clears out and when they did have pressure, we minimized their opportunities and forced them into situations where either it wasn’t the play that they wanted or it was a relatively easy save for me. The guys did a great job, I think penalty kill has been big focus for us because that was something that we struggled at times with last year and it starts with the goaltending and goes on out. When we’re cohesive like that it works out really well. -- [[Cal Petersen]]
- Shootout Selection
  > You know what, I had a few guys that mentioned number three. But we saw all our D take shots in exhibition season and they’re a little ways down the line. -- [[Todd McLellan]]
