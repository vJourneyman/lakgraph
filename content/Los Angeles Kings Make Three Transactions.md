## Summary
> The Los Angeles Kings have continued their near-daily transaction train, this time recalling [[Rasmus Kupari]] and [[Jordan Spence]] from the AHL. There is a bit of a surprise among todayâ€™s moves, though, as [[Viktor Arvidsson]] has been designated as a non-roster player. That means he is away from the team for some undisclosed reason, after playing the last two nights.
