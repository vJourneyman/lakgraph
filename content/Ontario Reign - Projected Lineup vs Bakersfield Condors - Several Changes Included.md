## Summary
> Saturday night’s game is being marketed by the host Ontario Reign using a Dia De Los Muertos theme. In stark contrast, this will be a new beginning for Kings prospect Andre Lee. Originally selected by LA at the 2019 NHL Draft, he’s yet to make his ‘official’ debut as a pro player – at least while being on a pro contract. After completing his third successful campaign with UMass-Lowell last season, he skated in 11 games for the Reign on a tryout contract. This year marks the first of his two-year Entry Level Contract and tonight will be Game 1 of that journey.
