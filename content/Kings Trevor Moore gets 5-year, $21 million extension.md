### [[Todd McLellan]]
> \[[[Trevor Moore]]] didn’t have the top-10 pick title. He had to scrap for everything. He was resurrected, maybe, with the trade. Some people had to help him but he took advantage of that help and he’s rewarded for it. Now the hard work starts, you gotta live up to it. He’ll do it.
