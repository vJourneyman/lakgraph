## Summary
> Hard to think of many individuals more deserving than Trevor Moore, who inked a five-year contract extension with the Kings yesterday afternoon, which will keep him with the organization he grew up supporting through the 2027-28 season. Moore didn’t want to be anywhere but LA and the Kings didn’t want him to be anywhere but LA either. A match made in heaven.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Trevor Moore]]
> I wanted to be here, I didn’t want to have to go anywhere else, so it’s good feeling to just get it done. Now I can just focus on hockey and winning games.

> I wasn’t really that involved, I just let my agent take care of it and tried to focus on hockey. You know it’s happening, so it’s always there, but I’m just glad it’s behind me.

### [[Rob Blake]]
> I think \[[[Trevor Moore]]]’s really fit into what we’re doing here the last couple of years. You saw a big step in his game last year alongside Phil Danault and he’s continued it, but he brings a lot of the leadership off the ice too, a lot of the qualities we look for to help keep this team moving forward. We’re excited to have him be part of that.

> Obviously we’ve got the three big guys in Quick, Doughty and Kopitar, but we’ve been pushing for these other guys. Some were drafted, some were acquired but they’ve kind of come up together with \[Moore], Kempe and Iafallo. Then you add Phil and Fiala into that mix and it gives us that extra level of leadership.
