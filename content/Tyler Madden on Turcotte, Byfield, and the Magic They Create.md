## Notes and Quotes
### [[Tyler Madden]]
> Playing with \[[[Quinton Byfield]]] and \[[[Alex Turcotte]], we’re starting to find some things and it’s happened to be a couple goals for me. We played well the last three \[games], even though we lost that first game, we controlled the game for the most part and I think we play really well together. We’re all very offensive, really good at reading and making plays, so it’s fun playing with them.

> I love playing with Turc. He works hard and he has all the tools. He’s skilled, he’s fast, and he’s not afraid to stick his nose out there. It’s always fun playing with him.

### [[Marco Sturm]]
> I think they have something. I also think Turc needed some time, as well, on the left side. He showed \[that tonight]. I think he had some great opportunities. This line, they’re clicking. Q and Madds had good chemistry last year when Q was down here with the Reign. I had a good feeling; I wanted to give them another shot and they were much better today.

> Q has been getting better every week, every day, pretty much. There is still a lot more in the tank with him. We’re trying to get him to his best. And when he gets called up again, we just hope he’s going to be ready to go. … It was good; it was nice to see him get going. Nice to see Turc get some good opportunities and get some points. But they know they still have a ways to go.
