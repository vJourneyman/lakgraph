## Notes and Quotes
### [[Marco Sturm]]
> They kept it pretty simple. They’ve done it a couple of times and it’s how they win games and it’s a good hockey team and they’re on the same page. We weren’t, and that was the difference.

> We have to score, I mean we have like 10 minutes left in the game and a big power play was coming up and we just didn’t score. But in general, I think we never felt like we were going to win this game today. Not on the bench, not on the ice. Again, we were not on the same page.

>\[[[Quinton Byfield]]] is a good player. He was out for a few weeks because of illness. I still think he can play a lot better. I’m glad he scored today though, it always helps a player. We try to work with him and give him a lot of ice time and get back to his “A” game. It was a good goal, but I think there’s more in him.

> Same thing with \[[[Alex Turcotte]]] and it’s even worse with him because he’s been out for a long time and we all felt bad but he’s working hard and he’s trying. I think the one thing I told him and we all have asked of him is to just keep it simple and that’s what he does. Is he the same Turc yet? No. But he does he job and I’m glad he’s back playing hockey. We will help him along the way but I think with him we have to be patient.
