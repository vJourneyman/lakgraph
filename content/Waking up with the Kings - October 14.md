## Summary
> Last nightâ€™s La La Brass band performances before the game and during intermissions were a solid change of pace from typical arena spectacle. Particularly enjoyable was a jazz-swing version of I Love You Baby that was easy to tap your feet along to. The rhythm was there. The band was tight and connected, they each knew when to take their solos and when to defer, they and everyone around them were having fun. You can probably see where this is going.
