## Summary
> The Los Angeles Kings made a splash earlier this offseason, acquiring forward Kevin Fiala from the Minnesota Wild.
> In the deal, the Kings gave up the 19th overall pick in this year's draft, along with prospect Brock Faber. The Kings then immediately signed Fiala to a seven-year contract, which carries a $7.88 million cap hit.
> Fiala is coming off a massive year, in which he scored 33 goals and 85 points in 82 games. I’ve gone in-depth about the trade before but in terms of the contract itself, it’s another win for the Kings.
