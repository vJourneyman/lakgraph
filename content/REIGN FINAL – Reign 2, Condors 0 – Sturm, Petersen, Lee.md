## Notes and Quotes
### [[Marco Sturm]]
> I think it was just a good team effort. It was a solid game from start to finish, starting with our goalie, all the good breakouts, and the forwards who did their job. It was a good one, even in the third. We only had a 1-0 lead but it was pretty calm on the bench and we felt good.

> The other night \[in Tucson] I had the first taste of it and again today. It’s a good cause and it’s always nice to see a lot of teddy bears on the ice. It’s definitely different. We had just scored, we felt pretty good, and it’s good momentum and then all of a sudden there’s a 20-minute break. It’s all different, but we’ll take it. The guys did an excellent job \[staying focused] today and the other day. The guys are more used to it than me. Sometimes a team takes advantage, some teams don’t, but I thought we stayed focused tonight.

> Sometimes it’s not easy for the whole line when they don’t really have a rhythm with a lot of special teams, but I give \[[[Andre Lee]]] credit, especially this weekend. I think he’s come a long way, starting with the rookie tournament. Now he plays like a man, not like a kid, so it’s nice to see. He’s willing to learn and he’s going to get better.

> It’s been a long day, I’m not going to lie. I’ve never seen anything like yesterday. It was an interesting 48 hours. I was not worried, but a little concerned about tonight’s game. Both teams had to deal with it. It was a long day bussing to Bakersfield, bussing back, and then just hanging around all day today. I was very happy with the effort today and how the guys handled the last 48 hours.

### [[Cal Petersen]]
> It was awesome. It was a team shutout. We kept a lot of volume shooting down and limited their chances. It’s a huge reflection of how well the team played tonight.

> I’m always just hoping that it’s not with like a minute to go in the game or in the period or something like that because then it just delays things a bit. When it happens it happens. It’s just one of those things, but it’s really cool. Thanks to the fans because we had a great crowd tonight. It’s exciting that the Teddy Bear Toss brings them in.

> It’s been a great transition. The guys have really brought me in. It’s an awesome group of guys. I’m really buying into the system that we have here. Yesterday was kind of a funny experience to have happen and it’s one for the memory books, but its been awesome here. The guys have been awesome and I’ve been very happy here.
