## Summary
> [[Alex Iafallo]] recently returned to the Kings lineup, and it probably couldn’t have come at a better time. Sure, coach [[Todd Mclellan]] welcomed him back with open arms. On a more personal level, the 28-year-forward is set to play in front of friends and family on Tuesday, as he’s from Eden, a suburb of Buffalo. Given that the Kings only visit the Sabres arena once per year, the timing lined up just perfectly.
