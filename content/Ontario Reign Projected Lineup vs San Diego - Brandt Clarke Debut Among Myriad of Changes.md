## Summary
> Ontario Reign coach [[Marco Sturm]] is about to ice a lineup loaded with a handful of the LA Kings top prospects. As expected, [[Brandt Clarke]] was assigned to the AHL early Sunday morning and will play today vs. visiting San Diego. With the big club headed out on the road, they recalled 24-year-old defenseman Jacob Moverare. This still leaves Sturm and his staff with the task of juggling eight defensemen this week. While not confirmed yet, we would expect to see Kim Nousiainen back in the lineup after sitting out the past few games. All of these moving pieces create a guestimate, at best, in our projected lineup below.
