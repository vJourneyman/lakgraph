## Notes and Quotes
### [[Phillip Danault]]
> We play the right way; whether it's Mooresy ([[Trevor Moore]]), \[[[Alex Iafallo]]] or \[[[Viktor Arvidsson]]] we seem to have the same mentality so it fits right in. Obviously, it was that kind of night where we all get a goal, we played the right way so we all got rewarded. 

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Tough situation to come into. Flew back, didn't know he was going to be in the lineup. Joined the group, it may have been a situation where \[[[Quinton Byfield]]]'s slotted more in the three-hole than the four-hole but the way [[Blake Lizotte]] has been playing I don't think he should lose minutes or position in the lineup. I thought he had another tremendous game so Q will have to play well and buy his time.

> Right now he's (Byfield) got to come and re-establish his game at the National Hockey League level. He's got to feel comfortable about the things he does. I saw him forecheck tonight going full speed, that would be one hell of a load to handle if you're a d-man. I saw him make real good defensive plays down low, he won faceoffs, he played with a bit of pace. You know, just get your game going again and we'll grow it from there and we'll begin to slowly pile on the expectations. But, for now, it's just about re-establishing himself here.
