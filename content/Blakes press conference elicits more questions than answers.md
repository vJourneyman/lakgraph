## Notes and Quotes
### [[Rob Blake]]
> I couldn’t sit here and say, ‘a week, two weeks, three weeks.’ None of that. He’s just going to go down. I trust in Billy Ranford and our goalie coaches to continue to work with him, but I think the biggest thing from our focus is he’s got to get in games continuously to get his game back to the level that he wants and we want.

>  I mean, that’s as simple as it gets.
>  We didn’t do it for a message, we did it to where we feel we can help Cal. We get him in a situation where we can get him playing games. We believe he’s a good goalie, and we believe he’s going to come back here and help us.

>  Sometimes you get in a room together with everybody – coaches, myself – and that theme is common among certain groups. 

> Todd, for sure. I don’t know – for the fans, it would probably be pretty fun to watch. I’m not sure \[it was] where we’re sitting. I’m not sure that game was going to have any basis with anything. That’s a one-off, you’re not going to hopefully see that too often.

> We’ve got to balance actual goals-against and expected goals-against and understand our systems. There’s a big discrepancy in those two right now, so we’ve got to find the underlying issues on that.

>  I think on the offensive side of things, you see a little bit of that production and handling more minutes and everything. It is a spot (Ontario) where \[[[Quinton Byfield]]] can work on a lot of aspects of his game in multiple \[situations] down there.
