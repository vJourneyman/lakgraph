## Notes and Quotes
- Building a Process-Based Offensive Mindset
	1) “Can’t get the puck” (poor acquisition volume)
	2) “One and done” (single-possession plays leading to turnovers)
	3) Low-quality sequences (multi-possession plays outside the dots)
	4) High-quality sequences (multi-possession plays inside the dots)
	5) Goals (high-quality sequences leading to scoring)
