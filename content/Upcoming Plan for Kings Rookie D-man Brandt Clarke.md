## Notes and Quotes
### [[Brandt Clarke]]
> I don’t know. I feel like it gave me time to develop, time to hone in with my great training group back home. I never really looked at it as a negative; I looked at it as a positive. It gave me more time to rehab and more time to be around the pros that I was training with in Ottawa. If I look at it as a negative and I get down on myself, that’s not beneficial for anybody, I don’t think. I’m just a positive person. I try to take the positives out of everything.
