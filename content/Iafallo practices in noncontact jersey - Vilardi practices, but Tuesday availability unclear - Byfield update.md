## Summary
> Forum Club. Here’s to the stillness of a Monday morning at TSPC, pastoral Alpine acreage when contrasted with Sunday skates more closely resembling the Airplane! scene where Elaine Dickinson asks if there’s anyone on board who knows how to fly a plane (NSFW). Several important practice and housekeeping bits before a Blake Lizotte story to come.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Calling \[[[Alex Iafallo]]] a player we missed. We miss him in a lot of different situations with and without the puck. Trusting player and identity player. He plays towards the identity most nights. We miss him, but we’ll get him back, eventually.

> When \[[[Adrian Kempe]]]’s involved physically and people are mad at him, he seems to play better, so maybe that will help \[his goal drought].

>  There’s no reason why \[[[Adrian Kempe]]] shouldn’t have 250 to 300 shots on goal this year for the amount that he plays on the power play. So, is he on pace? How much is he getting to the net?
