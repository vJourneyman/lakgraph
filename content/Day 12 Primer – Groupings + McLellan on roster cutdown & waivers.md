## Summary
> The Kings are back on the ice this morning to begin the homestretch of training camp. With the final week before what is called camp becomes practice, the Kings hit the ice in two groups once again, with a potential roster cutdown on the horizon.

> Our American League team is going to begin camp \[this week], so I think at that point, you’ll probably see a large group of players assigned to the Ontario Reign. The luxury of having your own \[AHL] team here right now is that we’re all in the same training camp, we’re sharing a facility. Players have already found homes, they know they’re going to play on one of the two teams and were progressing as one big group. We’ve divided the group with a little bit of forward thinking in mind, if you will, so the official transcript if that’s what you’re looking for may come fairly early this week.

> When we look at some of the other lines, there are players that we wanted to keep together there so now, we look at what’s leftover, we put them together and all three are battling for positions. All three are utility guys, where they can move around from position to position and I thought all three had good nights. The evaluation will continue tomorrow in practice and the day after and the day after. You know, the unfortunate thing is not everybody can play, we’re only allowed like everybody else so many roster spots and it’s a cruel thing, but that’s a fact of pro sports. Somebody is going to be here and somebody won’t and they’ll sort themselves out as time goes on.

> That would be a much better question for Rob and the management group, on waiver timing, who goes when and what triggers it. I’m not privy to that, we’ll talk about who we may want to keep and who we don’t keep, but as far as timing goes and what not, my experience is that every team is concerned about losing players on waivers at this time of the year, that 32 of them. Again, not everybody can play, you only get 23 spots so inevitably, some players have to be waived.
