## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> For us or anybody watching, to think that \[[Alex Iafallo]]’s coming in and going to wave the magic wand and be the savior, I think that’s very unfair for him or any other player coming back in that situation, but when he is up and running and playing to his capacity, he’s a very trusting player on both sides of the puck.

> When you’re talking to teammates of ‘who would you like to play with’ – sometimes coaches ask that question – number 19’s name comes up an awful lot.

> \[[[Adrian Kempe]]] will be just fine in that position. I think he’s actually looking forward to it.
