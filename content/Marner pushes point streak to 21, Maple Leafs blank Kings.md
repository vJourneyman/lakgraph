## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> If the mental part is not there, there is no way the physical part is going to be there. I thought we were light and slow in the first period, we didn't win any races, and then when we did even come close to winning any of them, we were real light with our sticks, real light with body position and it just kept going all night.
> I'm actually quite disappointed because we haven't used words like 'light' and 'slow' in a long, long time with our team. We've had some bad nights where we've made mistakes, but that was uncharacteristic of us and a little bit concerning.

### [[Anze Kopitar]]
> We didn't play nearly as good as we needed to, obviously. Even in the first period it was 0-0, but in large part thanks to Quick. Quite frankly, all of the credit goes to him. We just weren't good enough.
