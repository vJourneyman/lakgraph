## Notes and Quotes
### [[Jonathan Quick]]
> He’s been a good player since he came here, you know, tons of talent. When you’re young, trying to find your way in the league, it’s not easy. He’s worked through some tough patches. To see how well he’s playing, I’m happy for him. I know how much work he’s put in and how dedicated he is to the game.

### [[Phillip Danault]]
> He’s got an awesome stick, he’s good on the power play and his puck protection has been outstanding. He’s found his game. It’s not easy in this league to find your game, but once you find it, it’s hard to lose.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> It can energize the rest of the team as well. If \[[[Blake Lizotte]]] can get it done and get involved, be that aggressive and that hungry, there’s no reason why somebody that’s 50 pounds heavier and maybe even has a better skillset can’t be that. He does drive our team; we’re lucky to have him.
