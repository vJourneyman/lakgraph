## Notes and Quotes
### [[Marco Sturm]]
> That was the most disappointing part of tonight’s game: the start, because we talked about it. I thought we had a good week. I thought we were all rested, and our mind and body was just not there, that’s what was most disappointing factor.

> I think in general, we are a better team with the lead. You get behind by one goal, and what’s not a big deal and should not be a big deal, but \[the goal] came on our power play too. For some reason, sometimes we start to panic. I think we have quality in our lineup and enough good players who can handle a little bit of pressure and adversity, but tonight we repeated mistakes. We didn’t deserve to win tonight because of the start and special teams. I thought \[[Cal Petersen]] was good today. He gave us a chance, but it was all on us.

> I was trying to find some kind of life and that’s why I put some guys back together. I was hoping just to get more out of it. I was hoping to get more out of Tynan’s line and put Kupari on the right. Those are the things coaches try to do to get the team going a little bit, but it didn’t work today.
