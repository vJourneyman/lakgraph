## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Now the consistency thing is something that we need to grow.

### [[Gabe Vilardi]]
> We should score a power-play goal every game. If we get four or five looks, which we’ve been getting every night, we should be scoring a goal a game.

> It doesn’t matter where I play, I want to make an impact and make a difference for the team, both offensively, obviously that’s my goal, but defensively as well.
