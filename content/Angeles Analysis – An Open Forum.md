## Summary
> I’d like to get a feel here in one place for what you all are thinking as we hit today in Montreal. I think that the most difficult thing to really drill down on is that we know how good this group CAN be. The Kings were suffocatingly good in Ottawa. They’ve been suffocatingly good in other games as well, but far too frequently we’ve seen that drop-off the next game, or a couple of games down the road. We’ve seen a number of games that you could call a blueprint for how the team can be successful, and others that have been throwaways in that department. It’s not simply a matter of beating the teams the standings say you should beat, either.
