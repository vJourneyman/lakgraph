## Notes and Quotes
> What’s happened this year is opening night’s come pretty quickly for us There are teams that don’t play ‘til Friday, or they have a whole week of practice ahead of them. Ours came right away – but that’s okay, we should be ready to play. -- [[Todd McLellan]]

> It’s obviously very exciting. He was a big acquisition for us this summer, and he’s had great numbers, especially last year, so we’re going to try to complement each other with Juice as much as we can and score as many goals \[as we can]. -- [[Anze Kopitar]]
