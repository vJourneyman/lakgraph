## Summary
> After the loss in Vancouver earlier this season, Todd McLellan believed that certain individuals had come up short in that game, as opposed to it being a full-group letdown.
> Midway through a question last night, asking if last night was one of those nights as well, McLellan interjected – respectfully – to leave no doubt that it was not the case.
> “We lost this one as a team.”

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> We lost this one as a team.

> We have to look at each of the positions, starting with goal and then the D and then the forwards. We’ll break down the opportunities that we gave up. We gave up 30 shots on goal and nine goals, so where were they getting the Grade-A chances, what was causing them? We’ll try to get our group to recognize those situations and play them better.

> It’s a very, very confusing night for all of us. I’m really disappointed that we gave up nine goals, absolutely. On the other side of the coin, I’m glad that we fought back, got a point and scored eight. It’s mass confusion right now for all of us and we better figure it out quickly.
