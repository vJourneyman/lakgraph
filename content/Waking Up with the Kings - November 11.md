## Summary
> As the early-season oscillations have calmed into rolling hills and a flattening x-axis, the LA Kings have settled into a more linear progress absent of the game management issues and structural insecurity that volatized their period-to-period performances through the season’s first three weeks. The latest was a B-plus 64.97-minute performance that like Tuesday’s game could have been a workmanlike 3-0 win in a more forgiving dimension. Los Angeles wasn’t exiting and gaining zones with the same ease as the Minnesota game, but again stifled what little tempo their opponents were able to establish.
