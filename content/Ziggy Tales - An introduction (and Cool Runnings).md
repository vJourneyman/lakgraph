## Notes and Quotes
### [[Derek Armstrong]]
> \[Ziggy Paffy]’s introverted a little bit, kept to himself, but when you got to know him, he’s so unique as a human being. It was like, how could that guy be a superstar? The way he looked, the way he presented himself.

>  He didn’t really care about that stuff. He never liked the spotlight. It’s just not in his personality.

> Not even a question. Hands down the most natural talent that I’d ever played with in my life. Blakey (Rob Blake) said he never missed.

> You just gave him the puck and you got a point. That’s how good he was.
