> Quinton has a complete game. He can play in all situations. He’s big, he’s strong, he skates extremely well for a big guy, he makes plays, he makes people around him better. When he wants to, he can go win a game by himself. He hounds pucks, he creates turnovers by himself through his skating and how strong he is. -- [[Cory Stillman]], Coach of Sudbury Wolves

> He has a lot of qualities that make him attractive as a player. He’s an elite skater, he’s a big man in a big body, but he has the speed and agility of a smaller man. It’s incredible how he can turn on a dime and the speed he can do it with. He has great vision, a pass-first kind of guy but he has a pro shot, too. We feel he was the best player in the OHL last season and probably the greatest Sudbury Wolf player that’s ever come through here. -- [[Rob Papineau]], GM of Sudbury Wolves

> He’s a unique package. He’s 6-foot-4, can skate, he has the skill and very good vision. He makes a lot of plays, and when you have that kind of skill and that size, it makes him a special player that doesn’t come along too often. -- [[Alan Millar]], GM for Canada’s U18 Team

> I always want to be the first guy on the puck. I’m never afraid of going into a battle. I like to play fast, I want to use my speed to win races and use my speed to set up my teammates. -- [[Quinton Byfield]]

> Byfield’s size and skating combination on its own would make him a top prospect, but he combines it with some of the best hands in this draft class. His ability to break a game open with a display of individual skill makes him the type of player that is likely too good for junior hockey beyond this season. -- NHL Scout

> The athletic tools and the skill are no doubt elite, but I question whether he sees the game at a high level. -- NHL Scout
