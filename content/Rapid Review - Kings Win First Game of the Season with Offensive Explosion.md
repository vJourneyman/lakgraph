## Summary
> Saturday night, the Kings kicked off a five-game road trip with a bang — racking up seven goals to down the Wild. It wasn’t quite a similar thrill for the home team, as Minnesota has now given up seven goals in back-to-back games to open their 2022-23 season (following a 7-3 loss to the Rangers earlier in the week).
