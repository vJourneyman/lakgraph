## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> We got exactly what we thought we would get. Simple plays, well-defended blocking shots. It was kind of nice to have a righty and a lefty on all of the pairings tonight. \[[[Jacob Moverare]]] gave us what was needed, he was well prepared and ready to go.

> If \[[[Sean Durzi]]]'s day-to-day we think we'll have him next game. We don't know how he'll feel tomorrow, but we don't think his injury is major.

> I thought both goalies played well. \[[[Cal Petersen]]] made some tremendous saves, (Martin) Jones kept them in it when mistakes went against them. So both goalies did what they had to do. That's why the game went to overtime, in a low-scoring hard-fought match.
