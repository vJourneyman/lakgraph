## Summary
> Kevin Fiala scored his first goal for the Los Angeles Kings and had two assists in a 7-6 win against the Minnesota Wild at Xcel Energy Center on Saturday.


## Notes and Quotes
> Sometimes you feel better than other days, and today I felt pretty good from the start. Obviously a little more motivated playing against them, my old team, but it was good. A good first step in our direction and myself as well, and now we just have to build from it. -- [[Kevin Fiala]]

> If you'd have told us we were going to score seven goals, I'd have been jumping for joy. The giving up the six isn't the ideal recipe. That's a really hard game to explain. I'm not sure that we're going to give six goals up and win a game again this year. … Strange night. -- [[Todd McLellan]]

> Everybody struggled, right? You get seven goals scored on, your team struggles. To pin it on one guy or one guy didn't play well from the goalie out … everybody didn't play well, or else we would have not given up seven goals. -- [[Dean Evanson]]

> Offensively, it was a really good game for us, so that was a step in the right direction for us. On the other side of the puck, I think there are still some things we can improve, but you know, I think we deserved the win tonight. Even if it was 1-0 or 7-6, it doesn't matter right now. That's a huge first win. We got better in all three zones, and that was a good thing. -- [[Adrian Kempe]]
