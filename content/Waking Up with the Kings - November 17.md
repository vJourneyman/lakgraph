## Summary
> Any narrow game has its pivotal moments. According to Evolving Hockey, there were 10 game events that swung winning probability by at least 2.5%, but nothing other than the Trevor Moore and Zach Hyman goals really moved the needle over the first half of the game. As for a more abstract, perhaps narrative-driven measure, don’t overlook Cal Petersen’s ability to shut the door in the first period and allow Los Angeles to escape it with the lead. “Escape” is misleading – Edmonton had one shot on goal in the first 11 minutes, a team-shared defensive performance that resulted in the second highest franchise register of blocked shots in a single game. And that’s exactly the point – when you lead 1-0 in the scoreboard and 7-1 on the shot counter, and are holding Edmonton’s superstars without a sniff at net, the team and goalie have to find a way to enter the break with the lead.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Cal Petersen]]
> At the end of the day, these guys ended our season last year, so there is a little bit of payback in that. Again, we play this team as hard as any team, so it’s probably one of our best rivalries right now. We don’t really like anybody on that team, and I don’t think they like any of us, so it makes for a great game and it’s easy to get up for.
