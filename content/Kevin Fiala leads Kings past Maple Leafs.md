## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> That was a pretty dynamic offensive team that we played against tonight. Last year we went into their building, checked pretty well and we came up with a win, then we tried to run and gun with them here and came up with a big loss. We tried to use some of last year’s approach for the game.

> \[[[Cal Petersen]]] was a lot cleaner. There wasn’t anything that was seeping through him to the backside. Pucks hit him square, he looked confident, just a lot of really good things. He looked the way he should.

### [[Cal Petersen]]
> A great team win. We limited chances and shots; we blocked a lot of shots there in the third when they were really pushing. That’s what got us far last year, and that’s what’s going to get us far this year.

### [[Anze Kopitar]]
> It’s great to see. He’s had a couple tough years, uncertain years. The fact that he’s gotten off to the start that he has is great for us, it’s great for him and we’re going to need him to keep going.
