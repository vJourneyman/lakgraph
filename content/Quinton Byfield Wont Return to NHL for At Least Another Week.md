## Summary
> ‘When will the LA Kings recall Quinton Byfiled back to the NHL?’
> It’s one of the most popular questions among hockey fans on social media over the past month or so, and largely for two reasons: (a) the Kings have been fairly inconsistent; thus, people want roster changes and (b) some people are paying attention to his performance in the AHL.
