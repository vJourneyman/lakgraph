## Notes and Quotes
### [[Kevin Fiala]]
> It’s going to be great. My wife and I are really looking forward to this new opportunity. On the ice, I can’t wait to play for the Kings and obviously, Los Angeles is a great place to live. We’ve heard great things about it, so we couldn’t be more happy.

> \[[Viktor Arvidsson] and I] had dinner last Sunday, so it’s going to be nice to be able to play together and hang out together too.

> I received texts from so many of the guys, welcoming me to the team and wanting to know if I needed help with anything. I really appreciate all of that support. It’s one more thing that makes you look forward to this new part of my career.

> A lot of the players’ significant others reached out to my wife. They wanted to make sure she felt welcome, and I know she does. It’s been nice to have so many people get in touch with us and wanting us to be comfortable. That’s a good feeling to have when you come to a new team. We feel very fortunate.

> With the team, it’s going to be a great fit. They made the playoffs last year and the team is getting better and better. There is lots of great young talent and some really strong veterans too. It’s just a very exciting future for us. So, I’m looking forward to a new chance and a really great team. It’s a new challenge, but I’m ready for it. When I signed, I wanted to get out there. I couldn’t wait to start. Of course, the summer is a chance to relax, but the more it goes on, the more excited you get for the season.

> The restaurants, getting a chance to explore a new city, we are excited about that for sure. My wife and I really like Asian food and I heard the Mexican food is great there as well. Sushi, steakhouses, Italian  there’s going to be a lot of places to get out and try. When you think about it, you realize there is so much to look forward to.
