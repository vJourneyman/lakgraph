## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Good response by the group as a whole. Whether you were an eight, nine-minute man tonight or a 20-minute man, you were responsible for your game. I think we came to the rink and we trusted each other tonight. We didn't do that in Toronto, and it showed on the ice.

> It ended up being the winner, and anytime that happens to a team, one, we get a little bit of a lift, and it sets them back for a couple of minutes at least and buys you time.
