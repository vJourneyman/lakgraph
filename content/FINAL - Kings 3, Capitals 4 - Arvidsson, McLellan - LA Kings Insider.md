## Notes and Quotes
### [[Viktor Arvidsson]]
> I thought we didn’t take care of the puck enough in the third. They’re a good team and you’ve got to be aware in all situations. Not good enough.

> Yeah, I thought we were good in front of our net, in the first two periods we really limited their chances and had good sticks. Then, they hurt us in the third.

>Yeah, I think I’ve been playing better and better every game. I thought in the Nashville game I felt good and that carried over. I think I’ve been playing pretty well on this trip, better and better, and I got rewarded for it tonight. I’m more comfortable with the puck, making plays and we’re starting to get our groove back, me, Phil and Mooresy. We’re starting to feel better.

> Yeah, I think so. I thought we were good offensively in the Pittsburgh game, but a little bit weak defensively, the game got away from us. Yeah, I think it was a good game \[for our line] and we got rewarded.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Well, I’m not sure that we were that good in the first 40 either. There were some chances, but there were fewer. It was a dead game and what I mean by that is not a lot going on either way. We got fortunate we scored a couple goals, got the lead. In the third, they got rolling, obviously got some momentum. I thought when we when we eventually scored to tie the game again, you could kind of feel it going our way a bit, but it didn’t work, so that’s kind of a summary of the third.

> They’re all different game situations. You take the last one, it’s off Clarkey’s foot and goes in, the third one I think we were unfortunate, we caught a bad break because Lizzo loses his helmet and that’s exactly where the pass went. Good teams make you pay for those, not sure if I call them mistakes, but lucky bounces. That was the case tonight.

> I thought that line was very good for us tonight. They did a lot of things well defensively that led to offensive chances, so it’s a good sign that Arvy is getting a little more polish in his game. It’s been a long time since he played in intense games like this. They were fine, I think Phil Danault is really starting to come around, Moorsy looks good, so we’ve got that line going.

> Potentially, but they’ve played some games too, they’ve been traveling around. We took a different approach yesterday to have that gas in the tank. It’s taxing at the beginning of the year, you’re not used to the games coming quickly and spending eight or nine days on the road but certainly not excuse for giving up what we’ve given up, 23, on the road. If we left LA last Friday and somebody would have told me we would score 20 goals on this road trip I’d be pretty darn excited about winning a lot of games.
