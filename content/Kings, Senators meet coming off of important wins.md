## Notes and Quotes
### [[Sean Walker]]
> I think overall, we need to be a little more consistent, stick with our structure and good things are going to happen Kings defenseman Sean Walker said on the Bally Sports West broadcast during a night when he helped keep the Sharks in check after scoring a goal Tuesday in a loss to the New York Rangers. Just keep going with that game plan.

### [[Jaret Anderson-Dolan]]
> Feels great. Itâ€™s been a while, so it definitely felt good.
