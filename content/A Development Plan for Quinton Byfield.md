## Notes and Quotes
- Begin with the end in mind
	- Best case
	1) Plays Center
	2) is a Plus-value contributor both special teams
	3) Challenges for 20 minutes of ice time or more per game
	4) Scores at a point-per-game pace once his game is at maturity
- Show me how you move; tell me who you are
	- Hunched over skating style
	- Shoulders ahead of knees
	- Center of mass prevents loading ankles and staying low through sharp turns
	- Cutbacks will slow him down too much
	- Difficulty with passes on backhand low in the dzone
	- Worst case
	1) Plays LW
	2) Is a middle-six forechecking specialist
	3) Plays 10-14 minutes per game, mostly in a shutdown and PK role
	4) Scores less than 30 points a year
- Embrace the chaos
- The plan
	- Play the entire season in the OHL, aiming to be the best player on the best team
	- NHL team hires a player dev analyst to break down every game and a coach to ske with him every week
	- Does not play in an NHL game until his technical mastery matches that of Malkin at 20
	- In his first NHL season, his KPI is the number of possessions per 60 min; any defensive shortcomings will only be evaluated through the lens of "Is he getting enough pucks?"
