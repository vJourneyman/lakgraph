## Notes and Quotes
### [[Anze Kopitar]]
> We’ll correct that for sure. You can chalk it up to a first game and all of that, but the bottom line is that we just can’t afford to lose a game like that, especially with the amount of mistakes that we made.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> We’ve preached and preached about it, but sometimes you’ve got to get hit pretty hard with a two-by-four and maybe this was it.

> What \[[[Gabe Vilardi]]]’s done is he’s come in and won ice time and he’s earned the opportunity to be in key situations and he continued to play. I thought he was one of our better players again.
