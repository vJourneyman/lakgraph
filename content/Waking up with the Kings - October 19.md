## Notes and Quotes
> It would have been really easy on a back-to-back to just back it in and count it as a loss. We had a built in excuse, but I don’t think that’s the group that we have. …These are huge for our confidence, this is what defines a team, so I think it’s incredible that we were able to do that. -- [[Cal Petersen]]

> I think all teams are doing it. The fourth man on the rush, it’s a good look offensively. But there comes a responsibility with it as well. You can’t just jump up whenever you want. You’ve got to pick your spots and be responsible defensively. -- [[Matt Roy]]

> He has some confidence now. Our D has been in flex a little bit trying to find steady partners, but I think that’s in Matt’s game. He’s shown that in the past and it came out tonight. I’m sure there’ll be other games this year we’ll see it again. -- [[Todd McLellan]]
 
> I had a few guys mention number three \[in the shootout rotation], but we all saw our D take shots in exhibition season and they’re a little ways down the line. -- [[Todd McLellan]]
