## Summary
> At a recent Los Angeles Kings morning skate, I asked Todd McLellan which team we expected to see in their game against the New York Rangers – the one that plays 6-5 games or the one that plays 2-1 games. McLellan’s response was a throwback to a commonly used refrain from a couple of administration ago, “If we play it right it should be 3-2.”
