## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> I asked who’s hard to play against, and everybody’s going, ‘that guy, that guy, that guy,’ and I’d already watched \[[[Blake Lizotte]]] a lot. Sometimes that’s the best scouting. They’ll tell you who the better players are.

> Lizzo at that time was probably a lesser-known commodity in the league, and sometimes you get to sneak guys through that way, but you can only protect so many and that was a risk that obviously the team took.

>  I think I thought in the back of my head, my name was probably at least in the running to be picked. Fortunately, I was happy to be back in LA and it’s worked out so far.

> I just figured I was off the board by then.
> Once it got to that day, within a few hours of that draft process where they did the whole media thing, I figured I’d know by then, and I hadn’t gotten the call.

> I think that was part of honestly why I signed here.

### [[Blake Lizotte]]
> I had an inkling that Todd was maybe going to be here, and watching that San Jose team, you kind of knew the style he liked to play, and I knew that I could maybe fit into that. But you never really know until you get out there. You can put pen to paper, but as soon as you get out there you find out pretty quickly whether you mesh or not. I think for both of us it’s been a pretty beneficial relationship.
