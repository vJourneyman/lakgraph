## Summary
> With another AHL season about to begin on Friday night, excitement is plentiful in Ontario today. Coming off a year in which the Reign posted an all-time best power play and saw more than a dozen of their players get NHL games with the Kings, the entire organization is hungry for more. Finishing second in the Pacific Division and exiting the Calder Cup playoffs early wasnâ€™t what anybody had in mind last May.
