## Summary
> Shellshocked and embarrassed after a 9-8 overtime loss to Seattle in which they became the first team to score five game-tying goals in one game in nearly 27 years, Los Angeles failed to claim a second point from an offensive bacchanal they’d tied late in regulation, falling to 0-1-2 against the Kraken and 2-4-2 against the Pacific Division.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Alex Edler]]
> Honestly, I don’t really know what to say about this game. I don’t think anyone has ever been a part of a game like this, and honestly I hope I never do again.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> What was the last time you were in a 9-8 game?
> I don’t know. Can’t remember.

> How would you compare that game to the one in Minnesota?
> I actually think the Minnesota game was better played, probably by both teams, if I can recollect properly.

> Is there a lot to fix at this point when you give up nine in a game?
> Yes, definitely. The other side of the coin, when you score eight – it’s a very, very confusing night for all of us. I’m really disappointed that we gave up nine goals, absolutely. But on the other side of the coin, I’m glad that we fought back, got a point and scored eight. So it’s mass confusion right now for all of us, and we better frickin’ figure it out quickly.

> Were you seeing the buy in and the focus necessary to rectify those challenges throughout the game tonight?
> We gave up nine. No.

> What’s the first step forward starting tomorrow to get it back to where you want?
> We have to look at each of the positions, starting with goal and then D and then they forwards. We’ll break down the opportunities that we gave up. We gave up 30 shots on goal and nine goals. So, wherewere they getting the Grade-A chances, what was causing it, and trying to get our groups to recognize those situations and play them better.

> After the Vancouver game you said you felt it was more individuals that let the team as opposed to the group as a whole-
> We lost this one as a team. Sorry to interrupt your question.
