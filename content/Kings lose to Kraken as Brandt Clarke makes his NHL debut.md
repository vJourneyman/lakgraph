## Notes and Quotes
### [[Phillip Danault]]
> We have some work to do. We’re not playing the full 60 minutes, we’re kind of sloppy with the passes, little details, and we’ve got to capitalize as well.
> It’s not really about winning, it’s about getting our team game going. I don’t think we’re on point right now

### [[Brandt Clarke]]
> The first couple of shifts, the puck was on my stick too long. Every time I turned there was one of their offensive players coming to lay a body check on me so it was definitely a wakeup call right away. But I think I adapted pretty well throughout the game and was crisper later in the game.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> We played much better defensively than we did in Game 1. Our penalty kill did a really good job in a lot of situations. I know we gave up a goal but the five-on-three was real positive.
