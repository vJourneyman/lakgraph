## Notes and Quotes
### [[Trevor Moore]]
> It’s always a challenge over there with their top guys. We had a lot of blocked shots tonight. Must have been our most for the year. We got some great goaltending. It was a full team win. And I think that when we do that, we’re pretty hard to play against.
