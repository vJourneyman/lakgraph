## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> It wasn't the cleanest because the other team sometimes gets in the way. It was a really hard, heavy game for both teams, evenly played. We made the last mistake, and they capitalized.

> I thought both goalies played well. \[[[Cal Petersen]]] made some tremendous saves, Jones kept them in it when mistakes went against them. â€¦ We're taking it right now. There are other teams that are ten days behind us. \[They'll have to play back-to-backs] at some point, and if we're playing them, we'll have to take advantage of it. We all play 82 games.
