## Summary
> There goes the practice report that was in the works here. The Kings cancelled their on-ice practice today and held an off-ice workout, behind closed doors, with no media availability. The plan for today was to naturally see how the team aligned today coming off of last nightâ€™s 9-8 overtime defeat. Without the public, on-ice practice, minus an individual workout for Alex Iafallo as he continues his progress in returning from a lower-body injury, those observations will wait until tomorrow. The Kings held an off-ice workout today as a group.
