## Summary
> To the surprise of no one, it was announced that Los Angeles Kings goalie Cal Petersen cleared waiver Thursday morning and was assigned to the Ontario Reign. 
> The decision to send Petersen down came after the King's 9-8 loss to the Seattle Kraken, but the organization still has faith that Petersen will bounce back.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Rob Blake]]
> We can get \[[[Cal Petersen]]] into a situation where we can get him playing games, we believe he is a good goalie, and we believe he's going to come back here and help us. 

> We believe you're going to be here with us moving forward, but we need to find a way to get you back to the way you're capable of and the way we feel you're capable of.

> I don't think we're just going to trade just to do something. We're constantly looking at different solutions to go back to that consistency level, we've got to find that.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> It's never good when that happens to an individual. It's not good for the individual and it's not good for the team. It's obviously a sign or signal of performance and one guy bares the brunt of it and he plays a big part of it. But we're all responsible for goals against average and save percentage and we haven't done sufficient enough job of protecting our goaltenders and helping them out. You can't play perfect and they have to make a big save every now and then but we can still do a better job of insulating them.

> The individual is the most important thing right now and that's [[Cal Petersen]]. He's a tremendous goaltender and an unreal human being and we care about him. And when I see we that's everybody, the training staff, the coaches, people in this room that work for this team and media members. We care about him and we want him back and he's going to get an opportunity to work on his game there (the AHL). He'll get lots of help, he'll get many reps and I wouldn't be surprised to see him back here and playing real sharp. Can it send a message to the team? It damn well should, because we share in that transaction.
