## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Our game tonight has matched our year, where we're inconsistent. We're up and down, whether it's within a game, whether it's two-game segments, one-game segments, back to backs. We're still searching for that \[consistency].

### [[Kevin Fiala]]
> Going in with the lead like that, 2-0 in the first, we've got to find ways to just keep going, you know. It's no reason to step off the gas.
