## Summary
> It’s certainly more enjoyable to write these when you’re looking back at three wins, as opposed to two losses. And three extremely exciting wins at that. While the 2022-23 LA Kings haven’t looked identical to the 2021-22 LA Kings, this new version has shown it can win games in a variety of ways. Over the course of this trip, however, we’ve seen certain traits from last season’s team begin to reappear, and these are traits that last season’s team prided itself on, leading to wins over the course of the season.


## Players

## Notes and Quotes
> We’re going to inevitably have situations like this again throughout the season and we can reach back and know that we’ve done it before. It’s part of our identity now and it was part of it last year, so now we have the confidence that we’re never out of it and we can find ways to come back and get points, win games. -- [[Cal Petersen]]
