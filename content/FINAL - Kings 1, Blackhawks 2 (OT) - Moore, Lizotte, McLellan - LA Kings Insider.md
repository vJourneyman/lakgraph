## Notes and Quotes
### [[Blake Lizotte]]
> You know I think that’s actually more of our identity, Kings hockey. I thought we were pretty tight defensively, actually thought our team played a pretty good game overall. Just came up short in this one.

> Yeah, I think so. We’ve kind of started the year scoring quite a bit but also giving up a lot. I think our team is starting to turn around and play a little more defensive hockey, which I think most Kings fans are used to and Kings players are used to. I think that’s actually a good sign for us, when we’re in these 1-1 games versus 6-5 shootouts. I think it’s more our style and what our identity is and what we want to be.

> Yeah, for sure. As of late, my line specifically has been struggling on the defensive end of it. Our focus right now is just playing simple, smart hockey. When you can get pucks to go and it’s always nice.

> I think so, in bits and pieces. Obviously everyone wants to play a full 60 but it doesn’t always happen. I think going forward we need to take little bits from each game and try and put it together for a full 60.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> I would agree wholeheartedly. We talked about fixing some things after the Dallas game and we saw it today. They did a really good job of it, gave up very few out-numbered rushes. We were pretty solid defensively, good through the neutral zone, we did a lot of things well tonight. We didn’t get the win, sometimes bounces go against you and I think that’s what happened in overtime to Kevin in front of the net. At the other end, I didn’t think we had as much polish as we’ve shown offensively, some real good opportunities where we bobbled pucks with chances at breakaways, 2-on-1’s that missed the net or we didn’t make the right play. The one thing that’s been coming for us has been the offense and tonight it let us down a little bit.

> The NHL is all about winning games and they all balance out at the end but I thought tonight we may have deserved a better fate but we didn’t get it. The process part was one that, we’re not happy with, but we’re pleased to see process. Now we’re going to get home and get some rest and start to practice, we haven’t practiced forever.

> Well, that’s a that’s a tough question to answer because I think for two of the games it definitely did. Obviously the Dallas one, as I said in Dallas, you’ve got to give them credit, they really came out and played well. We did not respond and I thought as the night got tougher in Dallas, we got away from our structure more and more and that can’t happen. We got it back tonight, so it’s a good sign.

> I think it’s been a step forward every game, I don’t think \[[[Kevin Fiala]]]’s stepping back at all. He’s a very dynamic player and good players make other players around them better and I see that too. In Kevin’s, situation he creates, Carl Grundstrom should have a goal tonight off a tremendous pass from Kevin. He makes other players better, he keeps a lot of plays alive, very creative. He’s starting to figure out our system and our structure a little bit more. He’s a hell of a player.

> Definitely. When they’re playing and they’re playing well, they’re very trusting line and they can play against anybody, at any given time, in any zone. We haven’t seen enough of that from that group and tonight, they did a much better job.
