## Summary
> A fine afternoon to you from a Delta flight that departed the Bradley terminal as necessitated by Terminal 2/3 overflow, which is usually a nice change of pace. This is an old plane, and most of the planes I enjoy flying have the latest technological improvements and bulkhead maintenance, but this one’s are suspect, and after a reboot of a faulty internet (and entertainment systems), we were up and running with the world at our fingertips. Notes from a travel day ahead of an interesting five-gamer:


## Notes and Quotes
> I was thinking about it for a while. After the first couple shifts, I just wanted to talk to my dad, talk to my mom, see what they thought. It was special to see them. That meant the world to me that they were out here this whole week.  -- [[Brandt Clarke]] 

> It’s pretty cool, you’re just thinking about it. It’s officially forever now – I’ve played in the NHL, so it’s a really cool feeling.  -- [[Brandt Clarke]]

> It’s different. But it’s still cool because I still have all my family and friends there, which is most important. But Joe Lewis has obviously has a vibe that can’t be matched, really. It’s cool. The rink is beautiful, it’s nice, I’m excited to go back.  -- [[Matt Roy]]

> It’s hard to see everyone I want to see, but I just think I’m going to keep it close with direct family and maybe have a couple guys over for dinner.  -- [[Matt Roy]]
