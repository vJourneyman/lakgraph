## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> We needed more (offense) from our blue line. [[Matt Roy]], I think, leads or it tied for shots on goal for a defenseman. And he doesn't play power-play time, so a lot of it is happening 5v5 which is a real good sign. If the puck goes to the other team's net, who knows what can happen and a lot of times the offensive team gets it back. So that's a real good way for Matt or Mikey to contribute offensively and Roysie does have a really good shot.

> \[[[Alex Iafallo]]]'s just steady. He does a lot of little things, you could see early in the first period he was ready to go. I'm sure his hands and his legs probably won't feel as good as he'd like them too, naturally. But his mind was going to the right spot, real good sense at times. I liked that line, I thought that line played really well. 

### [[Alex Iafallo]]
> It felt great (to be back), to be honest. Watching all the time was hard to watch, still cheering the boys on but it's definitely great to get back there on the ice and have fun out there.

### [[Pheonix Copley]]
> It (the win) felt good. The guys played well in front of me which is always nice.
> I'm just taking it day by day, and doing everything I can to help this team win when I get the chance.
