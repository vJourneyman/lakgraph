## Notes and Quotes
### [[Marco Sturm]]
> We had a really good start. I think we didn’t give them a chance right away. They probably didn’t have their best game either, but we put them in that situation as well. It was really good for the most part. The only thing, I think, was that there were stretches when we kind of played at their level. We didn’t want to do that. We want to play our game for 60 minutes, but I’ll take 5-1 anytime.

> I think they’ve got something. I think \[[[Alex Turcotte]]] needed some time as well, especially on the left side, and he showed out today. I think he had some opportunities. This line is clicking. \[[[Quinton Byfield]]] and \[[[Tyler Madden]]] had some good chemistry last year when Q was up \[with the Kings] or down here with the Reign. I just wanted to give them another shot and I had a good feeling, and they were much better today.

> If you look at our record when we have the lead, I think it’s pretty good. I think we are a better home team as well. We played with more confidence too. At the start today we definitely set the tone right away and didn’t give them anything. It should that way. We love playing at home and I feel like the team is definitely more comfortable at home, probably like any other team, but we want to continue to have a good home record. Teams who come into this building should know it’s going to be a tough night, and that’s what we did [to San Jose] tonight.

### [[Jordan Spence]]
> I was getting a little bit nervous to be honest, but obviously it’s good to just get one out of the way. I think I’ve had great chances, but I just got to bury them. Today, luckily, I buried it. Hopefully I can keep that going.

> I thought I played pretty well. It’s pretty easy when I’m playing with \[[[Tobias Bjornfot]]]. He’s a great player and I think we’re getting a lot of good chemistry just because we’ve been playing together since game one. I think it was a good game overall between both of us.

> We just have to keep it simple. I think at the start of the season, we were doing really well. The last five games its been on and off, but I think we’re just trying to get our groove back, get our confidence back and just shooting pucks on net. We’re keeping it simple and then after that make some fancy plays and go from there.

> I just want to be more of a complete player. I know I’m a little bit of an undersized defenseman, but I can still lay the body and still play. So for me, I just want to be a little bit more physical this year and just become more of a role player as well. Obviously, up in the NHL it’s a lot faster, so I’m taking the experience in that and bringing it here. It’s really good for me to make those plays and I just want to be more of a complete player.
