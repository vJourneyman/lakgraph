## Notes and Quotes
### [[Phillip Danault]]
> We have to pack our bags, we have to go on the road and we have to go into a war zone. We’ve got to get a win and get back on track.

> I think this is going to be good for our team. We have a couple of new guys here, so this is going to be much needed.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> I think we’re going to see more and more from Kevin. I don’t think we’ve seen his best yet, but I think he’s going to be an important player as we go forward.

> \[[[Brandt Clarke]]] didn’t hurt us at all defensively; (he was) creative offensively. I’d like to see him shoot the puck a little bit because I think he’s got a great shot.
