## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Cal has to make that save. Cal made some outstanding saves. Cal was playing without a stick, we had two broken sticks, Edler blocked it, Cal punched it out. If that goes in, maybe we recover, I don't know. The one we did let in took a lot out of our team. He stopped a breakaway after that, we mishandled the puck at the blue line. Cal made some really good saves. Sometimes it's the one that you need rather than all the ones you made that make the difference in a game. And we needed that one.

> I thought Anze and Kempe had one of their better games lately. And that's probably do to the fact that Kevin was there helping them out. When I say that, I'm not demeaning Gabriel Vilardi's play. He's been really good. Just a different mix tonight a different energy on that line. And I thought that line gave us a game we maybe haven't seen in a little bit.

> Our game tonight matched our year. We're inconsistent, we're up and down. Whether it's within a game, two game segments, one game segment, back-to-backs. We're still searching for that.
