## Notes and Quotes
### [[Jordan Spence]]
> Yeah, I absolutely think moving all over the place has helped me adapt. The adjustments that I made as a young kid, I think, that’s really helped a lot.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> \[[[Jordan Spence]]] did exactly what he needed to do. He moved pucks, he shot it when he had the opportunity and he defended well. As (assistant coach) [[Trent Yawney]] would say, he wasn’t at the scene of the crime very often defensively. He played a good game.
