## Summary
> The Ontario Reign and Tucson Roadrunners meet for the second consecutive day at Toyota Arena Sunday afternoon, wrapping up a two-game series this weekend in Ontario. The Roadrunners prevailed in the opener on Saturday evening, claiming a 3-1 win behind 31 saves from goaltender Jon Gillies. Last season, on their way to a second-place finish in the Pacific Division the Reign posted a 5-2-1-0 record against Tucson, while the Roadrunners did not qualify for the postseason. This season has been different for the Arizona Coyotes’ affiliate, as the club is tied for second in the standings with 21 points through 16 games. The two teams will once again play against each other eight times during the 2022-23 regular season.
