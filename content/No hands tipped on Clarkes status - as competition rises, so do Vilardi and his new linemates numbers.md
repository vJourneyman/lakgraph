## Summary
> Forum Club. Yet another beautiful day in the City of Broad Shoulders. But last spring, few shoulders were broader than those of Jack Johnson. Eminently friendly and approachable, Johnson, who signed a one-year, $950,000 contract with Chicago this offseason, received that warmth back from a traveling Kings contingent eager to complement him on winning the 2022 Stanley Cup. Plenty of smiles surrounded the veteran defenseman who’ll appear in his 1,035th NHL game tonight.


## Players
- [[Jonathan Quick]]
- [[Brandt Clarke]]
- [[Drew Doughty]]
- [[Gabe Vilardi]]

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> They’re not afraid to score goals. I think that comes from their experience. I think Jonathan Toews is playing really, really well, and good for him. I’m happy for him. Obviously Kaner’s still a big part of it, but they’re proud players and they’re working hard, and when they do that, they’re very dangerous going the other way.

> I don’t know yet if we’re distributing the minutes the way we want to because we haven’t had a good run of consistent play night after night.

> \[...] when the game’s on the line, we have to make decisions real quick, and the last thing we’re thinking about is whether we should have the right player out there because he’s played a minute over his prescribed time. Doesn’t work that way.

> \[...]and that’s part of being a big winger.
> Defensively, \[[[Anze Kopitar]], [[Adrian Kempe]], and [[Gabe Vilardi]]]  work the game pretty well, so so far, so good.

### [[Gabe Vilardi]]
> Different line, different match-ups, but not really, I don’t think so.
