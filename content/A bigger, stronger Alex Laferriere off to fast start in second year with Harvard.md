## Notes and Quotes
### [[Alex Laferriere]]
> I think a big part of it was just kind of like the offseason and having this summer to get bigger and stronger, especially after that first year of experience. And then, obviously, the guys that I’m playing with are really smart players. So I think that experience is helpful and everybody around me has a lot more experience as well because a lot of them were first-year players last year, too.

> That was awesome. Just being able to get out there with all the other prospects and kind of put the names to faces and everything like that around the organization and the prospects were was awesome and getting to be out there for a week, and really nice weather was pretty nice as well.

> The Kings organization does a great job of keeping in touch. They’ve been kind of giving me updates periodically, kind of checking in with me and where I’m at. But, yeah, after development camp, it was awesome to have their in-person view on things and kind of see where all the prospects are for me personally. They definitely did a great job of communicating what they thought about me, so that was really special.

> It’s actually funny. My grandpa sent me these t-shirts that have ‘STP’ on them. It’s like the oil company, but he always says that stands for ‘Shoot The Puck.’ Whenever I have a game where I don’t shoot, he’ll send me one of those just to kind of remind me. But, yeah, I think that’s something I’ve been trying to focus on more is just trying to get more shots on net because as long as you’re shooting the puck, good things happen.

> I really never played there before. I was always kind of on the half wall in juniors and then last year a little bit. I like it, though. I think it was challenging for me at first just to kind of be able to find the open ice, but now that I know specific spots where the other guys are looking to pass me the puck, I think it’s worked out so far.
