## Summary
> Over the course of the last week, Todd McLellan has several times used the expression of pushing for perfection. That statement has typically been followed by the notion that achieving perfection, the way he’s describing it, is impossible for the Kings or any other team in the league. Even as things go well, perfection is not achievable, things can always been improved upon, polished up or flat out be done better.
