## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> It’s not necessarily just the last couple of games, throughout training camp and for the most part, the regular season. \[[[Kevin Fiala]]]’s had a knack for keeping plays alive, really good skill set, very good vision and we witnessed that last night. The game before, I think the combination of players that he’s with right now complement his skill set and as I said earlier, it balances everything out for our team right now. It’s a good look for us and it forces teams to think about how they want to play their D and their matchup forwards a little bit more. We’ll continue to do that until we have to make changes.

> He’s got a lot of experience, he’s a proven point producer, an offensive player, so when you put them on that line, he should be the alpha, he should be the guy that takes control. That’s not to underscore what the other two do for him. The speed, the tenacity, the finish of both \[[[Rasmus Kupari]]] and \[[[Carl Grundstrom]]] is a very complimentary pair to to Kevin skill set.

> As expected, \[[[Mikey Anderson]] and [[Drew Doughty]]] should be leading the way, take care of what happens in our zone first and really our offense comes from how clean we break out. If we can break out clean and get skating up ice, we save a lot of energy and we’re connected, weel good about ourselves heading that way. Mikey and Drew do a good job of initiating that a lot of times.

### [[Drew Doughty]]
> That’s our job as defensemen, that’s what we’re supposed to do, we’re supposed to defend the other team. Yeah, we’re supposed to get some points too, be more offensive, but we need to get back to playing better defense, that’s what our weakness is right now. and we need to sharpen it up.
