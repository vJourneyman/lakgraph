## Notes and Quotes
### [[Adrian Kempe]]
> We wanted to win the game after 60 minutes and I felt like that was something that we should have done, but they’re a good team, they have some good lines up front and it showed good character to come out with two points in OT.

> I knew I had \[[[Viktor Arvidsson]]] with me for a two-on-one. I tried to make a pass over the D-man early, and then I was expecting him to shoot but I was staying at the back post in case the puck ended up there. Arvy made a great play to me for an easy tap-in.

### Tyler Toffoli
> There was no doubt in our minds that we could come back, it was just a matter of putting in the work and staying with it.

### [[Blake Lizotte]]
> With \[[[Viktor Arvidsson]]]’s and \[[[Gabe Vilardi]]]’s skill level, it makes it easier for me to play. I can create havoc out there, play with speed and create time for them. They make good plays, so my goal is just to give them the most time possible with the puck.

> It’s demanded that I play better … it makes me a better player both with the puck and without the puck.
