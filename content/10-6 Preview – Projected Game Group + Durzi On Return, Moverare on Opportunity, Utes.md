## Summary
> The Kings head into their penultimate game of the preseason with their annual trip to Salt Lake City to take on the Vegas Golden Knights.

## Notes

### [[Sean Durzi]] 

- Expected to play his first pre-season game, returning from off-season surgery. That surgery apparently was to fix an injury he managed for awhile.

> I think that he had an injury that was ongoing, it was there and it was just time to have it fixed so that it wouldn’t keep continue on. Did it affect this play a lot, I think he’s played a lot with it, maybe he got used to it, but it needed to be fixed. -- [[Todd McLellan]] on [[Sean Durzi]]

> I mean, it wasn’t great, but itt’s something where I knew I would miss some time and I was just waiting for the right time, even if there never really is a right time. I got it done and I’m looking forward to feeling even better. I guess I just got used to it and played through it. -- [[Sean Durzi]]

> Maybe just the speed of making reads defensively again, but obviously that comes with getting games in and that will come. The coaches are pushing me every day and making sure I’m doing things right and that I’m doing it to the best of my abilities and then pushing it to be even better than that. -- [[Sean Durzi]]

> Feeling good, ready to go. I’m excited finally and there’s not much more to do. Just go play. -- [[Sean Durzi]]


### [[Jacob Moverare]]
> I see every day that I get to play here during preseason as an opportunity to show how I can play, play well and earn some trust with the team. -- [[Jacob Moverare]]


> I think it’s just about being steady, that’s my main thing that I need to really focus on. I have to prove that they can trust me to be a steady guy. In practice, every 2-on-1, every 3-on-2, I try to not get scored on and I want to hit every pass, focus on the small details. -- [[Jacob Moverare]]

> Both Edler and Royzie are two guys that I try to look at a little bit extra, because they’re both really steady guys. I try to watch them, see what they do and how they play. -- [[Jacob Moverare]]
