## Summary
> The Kings schedule has not permitted for three days off in between games all season long until this point. The holiday break presents the first break of more than two days this season and for the team that has played more games than any other in the NHL up until this point, it’s much welcomed. Not a ton in the tank right now for this group and three days to recover and recharge, with some time away from the rink, has come at a good time.
