## Summary
> The Kings and Ducks square off for the second time in three days, with the setting moving to Honda Center in Anaheim.

## Notes
> If you see them in our group, they’re usually one-hundred percent, because there’s no way you can put a goalie in there and tell them to take it easy, waste of time. So there’s goaltender work that’s done outof sight sometimes, different sheet of ice, just rehab work. -- [[Todd McLellan]] on goalies returning from injury

> The goalies are a different breed, we all know that. They get a little bit of time with Billy and his goaltending staff, sometimes even away from the team. Just movement, tracking pucks depending on what the injury is, and then they come back into the group. -- [[Todd McLellan]]

> He doesn’t lack confidence and he doesn’t portray arrogance. That’s a pretty good quality to have. -- [[Todd McLellan]] on [[Brandt Clarke]] heading into his fifth of five pre-season games

> That’s kind of what I was hoping for, I love playing games. The games are the best part of hockey so yeah, it’s been it’s been really good so far and I’m not looking for a break. I’m not tired, I’ve got that youth in me, so I still have a pretty good engine. I’m not banged up or anything, I’m ready to go every night and I’m pretty happy that they keep putting me in there. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]

> I think so, yeah, that’s what I’ve been doing and everyone just keeps encouraging me, they keep showing me stuff to do and helping me out but they’re still encouraging me to do my thing. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]

> He feels comfortable with his toolkit, he can use it anywhere he wants on the ice. It’s different and it’s going to get even more different as early as \[tonight’s game] as more and more top-six players come into the lineup and rosters get stronger and stronger. He’s discovering his boundaries using his confidence, what can I get away with and what can’t I. So far so good. It will be probably a smaller toolbox as the league gets better, but give him credit for using the tools that he has. -- [[Todd McLellan]] on [[Brandt Clarke]]

> I’m really confident in myself right now, things have been going pretty well for me and I’m really happy with how I’ve been playing but you have to bring your best each game. You may have played well last game, but you have to step it up even more this game. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]
