## Notes and Quotes
### [[Drew Doughty]]
> I played him hard right before that, even \[I maybe] crossed the line a little bit. But he’s their best player and you need to play him hard. It was an advantage for us to get him out of the game, big time.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> They hold each other accountable. Sometimes there’s the three of them bickering about what should or shouldn’t happen, but once the play starts again, they’re a pretty good unit.
