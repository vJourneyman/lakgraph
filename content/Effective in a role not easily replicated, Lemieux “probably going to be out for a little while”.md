## Summary
> The LA Kings scored the fastest goal off the opening faceoff in 35 years, sustained their robust forecheck, and held off Detroit’s late special teams challenges to complete a 4-0-0 homestand with a 4-3 win Saturday night in Downtown Los Angeles.
> Brendan Lemieux is going to miss time. The forward suffered an apparent lower-body injury on an offensive zone body check on Detroit’s Adam Erne and returned for one shift but was unable to finish the game.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> You look at the goals against in the homestand, even tonight there wasn’t an even strength \[goal tonight]. It was two power plays and a six-on-five. Power plays last game \[against Chicago], and a shutout \[against Minnesota].

> Good teams play with detail all the time – over and over ad over again. They don’t let it slip,” McLellan said. “And that’s what we’re pushing to be.

> They’ll look at \[[[Brendan Lemieux]]] in the morning. I think he’s probably going to be out for a little while, but I can’t give you more than that.

> You know what? We’re coaches. We whine and bitch about everything. Like, we just won four games at home, and we’re in there, we’re trying to fix something already. Maybe we’ve got to smarten up a little bit and relax, but that’s what we do. There are parts of our game that are really good right now, there are parts that we can improve upon. I thought we should have control of this third period better than we did today. Started right off the bat. We weren’t sure we wanted to play cute or we wanted to play direct. We tried the cute way, we went to the penalty box and now it’s 4-2, it gives them a chance to pull their goalie. I don’t think they’re pulling him at 4-1, and we didn’t need to be in that situation, but we were.

### [[Adrian Kempe]]
> I think it’s more with having two one-timers out there at the same time.

> A good friend of mine, and I obviously didn’t mean to do that, but he seemed OK.

### [[Carl Grundstrom]]
> I just tried to push up, and \[[[Alex Edler]]] made a great play to \[[[Rasmus Kupari]]] and we got a two-on-one. It was a great play by Kup too, so I just tried to get it on net and it went in.
