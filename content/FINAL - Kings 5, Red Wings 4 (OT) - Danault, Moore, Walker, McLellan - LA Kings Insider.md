## Notes and Quotes
### [[Trevor Moore]]
> Yeah, for sure. It’s huge to have Arvy back, he’s a huge piece to our line and he brings so much offense to it. I think that was good, but I think we have to keep building in a lot of areas, myself especially win more battles and come up with more pucks and sustain pressure in the o-zone.

> It was kind of a weird play, I was coming for a change to get the defenseman on because we were on the power play and then the power play was ending. Everyone started yelling that the puck was right there, so I just turned it up. I just saw Phil on the back side, it was kind of a weird play.

> Yeah, I think that we’re doing some good stuff defensively, just still too many penalties. Putting too much weight on our penalty kill and Quickie in those spots.

### [[Sean Walker]]
> Yeah, it was five minutes into warmups, I was just hanging out in the back and I heard Eds took a puck somewhere and just to be ready. I kind of started my warmups there and just got ready and got out there. Not the usual routine and everything, but I think I handled it well.

> Mentally, I don’t think there was very much time, it was just go out there and let the body take over. Physically, I had about five minutes to roll out and stretch quick, then it was get ready. It was definitely weird, but I think I handled it well and I was happy with how the game turned out.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Real good effort, we’re getting better, it’s starting to feel a little bit more like how he should play. There are still moments during the game, obviously the empty netter, where we’re not quite there yet, but for the most part I thought we started to look a lot more like we should. Quickie had a good game, circumstances were strange again tonight, with Edler going down in warmups, and Walker by far had his best game of the season so far, including preseason so that’s a good sign. Good effort by everybody.

> Well, the players themselves, we had a lot of experience, four or five guys they settled down, everybody wanted to win it for Arvy, you saw a lot of guys going over and tapping him, saying no problem we got this. That’s how it ended, but we sure don’t want to be doing that too often, putting ourselves in that situation.

> The ability that upper-end players, just to make very small plays to keep a play alive or to create a chance….it was just a little touch through the neutral zone. Sometimes, our not-so-offensive players would quit on that, or they’d have already turned and they’d be backchecking, but the gifted ones are able to do that. Similar goal the other night in Minnesota with Kempe coming down and finding a hole off that wing with speed.

> We yelled at Sean Walker to get his equipment on, no warmup and he played, that’s all you can do. The game plan doesn’t change because one guy goes down, next man up and that’s how it happened. For me, I know Sean Walker would have to answer this question, but that may be the best way for him to go in and play. No thinking, just go play the game. His ability to come back from the injury after not having played for a long, long time, I thought tonight he did an admirable job under difficult circumstances.
