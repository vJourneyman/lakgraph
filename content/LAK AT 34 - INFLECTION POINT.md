## Summary
>  If you like roller coasters, you’re loving the Los Angeles Kings season so far. Their six-game roadtrip ended on, what else, an unexpected high note with a two-goal third period rally that positioned Los Angeles to win a seven-round shootout against the NHL’s best team, the Boston Bruins.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> When we got \[[[Trevor Moore]]] there was not necessarily a history, there was a tie to people that believed in him. The people in Denver (where Moore played his college hockey) or someone from his former coaching staff in Toronto that created some confidence. Last year, he came out of the World Championships as a really good offensive center and he had a ton of confidence. We tried to move him around and it wasn’t working really well until we found a home for him.  Once that happened and things started to click, he grew more confident and that was the turning point. 

> The one thing he has done –if your play wavers a little bit, sometimes you give your spot up, he hasn’t done that. He’s kept spot since he’s got it and that’s because of his input to the game night in and night out. 

> I would say yes, but I think we’ve been taught enough lessons already and (the Boston performance) reassures it. (It becomes a lesson) only if it’s taken and applied. The game in Boston wasn’t comfortable for us because we had to come from behind and it’s a tough place to play, it was the back end of a road trip. We stuck with it and didn’t open the game up when it wasn’t going our way. After the Buffalo game (a stunning 6-0 wipeout), the Boston game presented the lesson to us again, it’s a lesson if we take it and use it.

### [[Trevor Moore]]
>  The biggest thing was finding a role, everyone wants to be a top-six guy. It’s really hard to jump into the NHL and have a top-six role. You have to establish yourself and get your foot in the door – learn how to penalty kill, how to play well defensively and if you’re not doing that it’s going to be really hard to get your foot in the door. And once you’re in, keep growing and keep believing in yourself.

> No, I’m on a little bit of a cold streak here, I wany to get back (to the level of play expected) and help this team win. It’s nice to be here and have things settled for five years but I want to be here and be part of the winning.
