## Summary
> The LA Kings defeated the Florida Panthers Saturday night 5-4, but not without some fireworks in the final minute.
> Late in Saturday night’s victory, Panthers forward Matthew Tkachuk became public enemy number one to the LA Kings and fans once again. With 37.9 seconds remaining, after a Jonathan Quick stop and a stoppage of play, Tkachuk put his hockey stick into Quick’s mask and poked his eye.
