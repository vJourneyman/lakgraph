## Notes and Quotes
- Gabe Vilardi PPG
  > I can’t say enough about the young man, he’s been outstanding since training camp. The fact that Arvy wasn’t able to go after warmup, it was a bit of a surprise to us, but things got shuffled quickly, and he has the toolkit to be playing up there. He’s got a lot of confidence on the power play right now, he’s checking well, using his body, his size. I think, as he leaves the rink every day, he’s really enjoying the game, and he’s earned it. -- [[Todd McLellan]]
- Brandt Clarke's Assist
  > Arty made a nice play to find me with a lot of time and space. Really gave me a good amount of time to read my options. I saw Lizzo backdoor because the D cheated off to me. Good play all around, good play by him. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]
- Kings kill off 5-on-3
  > I thought our penalty kill was very good against an outstanding \[power play]. There were a whole bunch of good things tonight, but I thought our penalty kill gave us a strong belief. 5-on-3, a few other situations, we drew a penalty on our penalty kill, great goaltending. That was a real important thing, and then fewer home run chances for the opposition. We’re not perfect, but there were fewer, and I thought we committed more to checking than we have in the past.
- Defensive Shutdown
  > We aggressively checked, and sometimes when you ask your team to check, they back off, and they’re just standing and taking it, but we aggressively checked. When we had to go up ice, we went up ice. When we had to do what we needed to do in the neutral zone, we did it. We were all playing the same system, for the most part, versus off on our own.
  > This is a brand new slate for us. Yeah, there are some tendencies (from last year) that showed up, which is a good sign, but I’d like to think we’re moving in the right direction, even the game in Washington, other than the comeback. We’re starting to do some things characteristic of last year, but this is this year’s group. We’ll still find our way and evolve as we go
