## Summary
> Since this is The Power Rankings, we wanted to offer our own take on which team’s records are the real deal right now and which records are lying to us. The results may surprise you.
> Kings ranked 21st holding steady from last week. 
> Is their record for real? No. The Kings have a competitive record right now in the West, but it’s all a mirage.
