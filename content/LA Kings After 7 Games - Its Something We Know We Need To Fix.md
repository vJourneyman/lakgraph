## Notes and Quotes
- Offensive Improvement
  > I think I’ve been playing pretty well on this trip, better and better, and I got rewarded for it tonight. I’m more comfortable with the puck, making plays, and we’re starting to get our groove back, me, Phil, and Mooresy. We’re starting to feel better. -- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]
- Defensive Regression
> We’re leaving the goalies out to dry at times, they’re making big saves, sometimes they’re going in, but we’ve got to be better defensively. I know guys want to get their points and play offense, but that’s not how you win games, in my opinion. We’re not a team that’s going to win games 6-5, we need to be a team that’s giving up two or three goals a night, and that’s the most that we’re giving up. I’m not the only one preaching that, everyone’s preaching that. It’s something we know we need to fix.  -- [[Drew Doughty]]
- Problems in Net
  > I guess with Cal, there’s no secret. We’ve got to get him going. He’s got to play like he can play. He’s an NHL goaltender […] and we’re trying to get him to where he can be, and he has to be better. I can’t stand here and bullshit you guys. It is what it is. -- [[Todd McLellan]]
- Quick Hits
	- Powerplay Woes
	- Decision Looming on Clarke
