## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> For the last three weeks, we’ve talked about, can we win a game 2-1 or 1-0?. We find a way to do it.

> As you get better as a team, you’re looking for perfection on both ends, it doesn’t exist. We still have a long way to go to really get to that point.

> It was one of those nights where if the power play was sharp, we could have been up 3-. When your power play is not there and you can still win the game that was a real positive, but we did work on some things in practice (Monday) that we haven’t had any time to and you can see some of the results here (against the Wild).
