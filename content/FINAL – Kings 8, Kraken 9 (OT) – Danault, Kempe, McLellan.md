## Notes and Quotes
### [[Phillip Danault]]
> Be stronger defensively, for one. When we make little mistakes, they cost us every single time, so we’ve got to learn from this. We can’t just keep doing it game after game, we have to learn from this. If we want to be a winning team, and go far in the playoffs, we have to work on it right now.

> Yeah, tonight I feel like every mistake went in our net, every time. I guess it was that kind of game, I’ve definitely never been a part of one like this. We got a big point though, we came back and we kept believing in ourselves in the third……although we were poor defensively, we got a big point.

> It was definitely that kind of a weird game, you could tell it was going to be high scoring. We kept believing in our offense in the third, kept pushing and obviously came back. Big point, but definitely a lot of work to do.

### [[Adrian Kempe]]
> They’re hard to play against, ever since they came into the league, they’ve become a much better team than last year. They were hard to play against last year, but this year I feel like their team game is really good, it’s been some really tight games. Obviously a weird game tonight, not good enough in the d-zone and the offense was really good. It could have gone either way.

> I just don’t think we executed in our own zone very well and on the other side of that, we did a good job offensively. It was a weird game, we had one of these earlier against Minnesota, where both teams played good offense and not very good defense, that was pretty much how the game went.

> When you’re down two goals going into the third and you feel like you can still win the game, it’s a good thing. On the other hand, we didn’t play nearly as good as we can in our own zone, too many turnovers. That’s the thing we need to get better at.
