## Notes and Quotes
### [[Kevin Fiala]]
> I think I’m a fast player that is offensive, can pass the puck, can score goals and yeah, I hope I can show some defense as well.

> I can tell you guys, honestly, I couldn’t be \[happier] to play in LA.

> \[[[Rob Blake]] and I] had a great talk, actually, about one day before I signed, on a Zoom call just back and forth about what they want it, what I want and it was just a great fit. We both felt like \[that], so it’s very important, I think that works out from both sides and it did so I’m very happy.

> At the start of the year, I put too much pressure on myself and my goals were high, but it’s a new season, you start from zero, you \[want to] jump from zero to 100. So and that was maybe the problem, I didn’t quite get it \[in the first half of] last year.

> It really worked out great with the points and the goals, especially the second half of the season. I just went with the flow, didn’t put too much pressure on it and enjoyed every single minute……in the second half, I was kind of just having fun, working hard and seeing what happened. I didn’t put as much pressure on it on myself, so that helped.

> That will be a big goal for me, to help the team be better at the powerplay. Of course, I will see what the coach says, where I should play or where I will play. I played on half-wall in the last few years, so we’ll see. Wherever he puts me I will be fine. You know, the last few years I’ve been on both flanks I’ve been in the middle, we’ve been mixing around. So we’ll see.
