## Notes and Quotes
### [[Anze Kopitar]]
> I don’t know about a statement game, but I thought our energy was there right off the start. It was a bit of a test in the second period the way we went down two goals, you know, we came back Kopitar said.

> Going into the third period with the game tied, and being able to play the hockey that we want to play, stingy and tight, not giving up a whole lot, that was a great third period.

> We’re all pros. We know what we’ve got to do, and, ultimately, this business comes down to wins and losses, and it’s a lot more fun when you win games.



### [[Todd McLellan]]
> \[[[Anze Kopitar]]] was tremendous tonight. He’s been good all along, sometimes the goals coming off his tape aren’t there, but he’s done really good things this year.

> I thought there was a missed call on the faceoff, for interference on Mooresy. Then Edler loses his steel in the corner, we’re down a player and can’t recover. So, strange scenarios that, right now, with our team, could push us one way or the other, and I thought the end of the second, coming back, set up for the third.
