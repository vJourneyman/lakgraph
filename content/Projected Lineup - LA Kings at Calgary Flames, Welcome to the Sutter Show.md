## Summary
> Despite the Kings riding a four-game winning streak and arriving in Canada with a little momentum on their side, veteran [[Drew Doughty]] is probably a little bit bummed today.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> How can you not respect Darryl and his family? I’ve known the Sutter’s for years; played with some of them, coached against all of them. But I’m a fan of his press conferences. He does a real good job of answering questions, I think.
