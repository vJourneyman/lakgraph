## Notes and Quotes
### [[Phillip Danault]]
> It's a hard game when you score right away, like you don't want your teammates to get flat and think it's going to be an easy game. Almost was good that they score back after and got us right back in the game, and we just kept playing our game for 60 minutes solid, so I'm really proud of our boys tonight.
