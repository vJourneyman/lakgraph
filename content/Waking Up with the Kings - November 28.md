## Summary
> The visitors didn’t deviate from their game plan. They stuck to structure, forechecked heavily, defended and tended goal well, created and capitalized on turnovers, and never played from behind. As for L.A., the oscillations in play, period-to-period, are depleting their emotional seismograph’s ink.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
>  \[[[Sean Durzi]]] was giving us his best and he made a mistake, and those are easy to throw the guy back out. It’s the one where you’re lazy or you’re selfish or you had a turnover.

> Between the first and second we had to have a little talk about how we were playing.

### [[Anze Kopitar]]
> Our line the last three, four, five games, it’s been as many chances as we can get, and I thought we played a really solid game tonight.
