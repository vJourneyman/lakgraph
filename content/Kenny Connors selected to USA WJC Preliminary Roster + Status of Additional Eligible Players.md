## Notes and Quotes
### [[Chris Peters]]
> [[Kenny Connors]] is a two-way center that can drive play and I think he fits the style USA wants to play. 

### [[Rob Blake]]
> With the World Juniors coming up, we have a decision to make here within the next few days. We’ve had calls, multiple calls, with Hockey Canada discussing that and Brandt included. We travel on Monday, back to Ottawa and Toronto in that area, when Hockey Canada’s camp would start up, so we’ll have a look at those things there for next week.

### [[Brandt Clarke]]
> He’s been back now since last Sunday, he didn’t play on the homestand and he’ll head out to Ontario, he’ll make the trip, and some decisions will need to be made when we’re out there. What has he gotten? He had a real good training camp, he had experience early in the season and he got to go to the minors and he didn’t miss that step this year and now he’s back and he’s getting to practice with the group. It gets hard for an individual when that happens, because you’re doing the work but you’re not getting the carrot, it can be hard for a young player to understand, but that’s a part of the situation he was made aware of. Moving foward, we’ll see where it all goes.

### [[Scott Salmond]]
> While we continue to have discussions with NHL teams regarding additional players that may be available to attend camp, we are thrilled for the 29 players that have been named to our camp roster.
