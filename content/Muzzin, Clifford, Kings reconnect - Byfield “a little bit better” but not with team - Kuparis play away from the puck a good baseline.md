## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> You can not make up for lost time no matter how hard you try and how bad you want to do it. Lost time is lost time, and it’s gone, and sometimes when you chase that make-up phase it becomes really tough.

> \[[[Rasmus Kupari]]]’s a big man that skates extremely well, and his play without the puck is something we’re proud of. He does a really good job sorting things out, coming back to his end, he defends well. Long stick, very good penalty killer when he has to do those things. Quite often those first round draft picks are always relied on to score. ‘Is this guy going to score 35 or 40?’ We want him to score. But there are some things he does really well right now that if he keeps doing those things we’ll keep him available to us.”
> Give Ras credit, because he’s found a niche to get himself here, and hopefully that scoring does come later.

### [[Drew Doughty]]
> It was good to see \[Kyle Clifford and Jake Muzzin]. They came over for a little bit the night before the game, just chatted it up, had a couple beers. It was good to see them. Muzz, I always keep in contact with and see him in the summers. Cliffy, not as much, but I got to see both of them this summer and we’ll be friends for a long time.

> \[Jake Muzzin]’s had to battle through a lot, and he plays the game hard, blocks a lot of shots, a lot of hits. It’s hard for a guy to play as long as he has playing the way he does. Credit to him – he’s such a big part of that team and I think you can really see the Leafs missing him right now, so hopefully he gets back and is able to play again, but health comes first, so that’s all we wish – that his health gets better.

### [[Gabe Vilardi]]
> I don’t need much feedback. I know when I’m playing well and when I need to play better..
