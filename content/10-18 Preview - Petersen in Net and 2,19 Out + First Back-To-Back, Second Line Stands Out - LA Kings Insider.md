## Notes and Quotes
- First back-to-back game (or more precisely, first second half of a back-to-back)

> We’re trying hard right now as a group to find our games within our team game, individually and collectively as lines, we don’t want to throw a lot into the blender. I think, then, you’re starting all over again. Our lines will stay pretty much intact. We’ll look at filling that Iafallo spot with somebody else, whether it’s Arthur, Grnuny or Lemieux, someone like that and we’ll make that decision and go from there. There’s always the opportunity for in-game adjustments if it’s not going well. -- [[Todd McLellan]]

> No \[nothing special] it’s just more of the same. Listen to the training staff, they’ve been great for us in the past and we’ll continue to lean on them. Just take care of your body and all that stuff and we should be good. -- [[Trevor Moore]]

> In those situations, everybody was important, you’ve got to use the full bench and all six D and try to balance it out. I don’t recall our penalty totals in those back-to-back games, obviously there’s a lot of data there, but if you can stay out of the box, you do yourself a favor. Goaltending in back-to-back games is huge, it’s the backbone of playing especially early in the year. Other than that, it’s an old cliche, but you need everybody, especially early when your body and mind may not be used to it. -- [[Todd McLellan]]

> They did look like themselves. They checked, they played very well defensively, they kept plays alive, created when they had to create. They did a lot of things that we witnessed for 82 games last year. You know, for individuals, it takes little time to find your own rhythm, to find your group’s rhythm and then your team rhythm and we’re still not there, but we’re doing our best to get to that point. -- [[Todd McLellan]]

> I feel like this was the first game I felt like myself again. It was a good step in the right direction, I think. -- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]

> Yeah, you try to get the pace underneath you and the rhythm of the game. It’s a lot of penalties and stuff and you get off rhythm and have to get back on it. It’s been tough, but I think I’m getting there, I’m just trying to build on it every game. -- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]
