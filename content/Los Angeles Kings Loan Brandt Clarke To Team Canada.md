## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Sometimes players get rushed and we don’t want to do that with \[[[Brandt Clarke]]]. There’s the hockey part, and then there’s all of the strength and professional habits, practice habits, travel habits and teammate habits that are really important and you don’t always get that at the junior level when you play 38 minutes a night and you stay on the power play for two straight minutes. I’m not saying that’s happening with Clarkie, they’re a very well-run team \[in Barrie], but that can happen in certain situations. Right now, we think that this is a real good spot for him and we’ll see where it goes.
