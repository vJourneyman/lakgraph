## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> It has been that way for a couple of nights. We'll see what happens in Dallas (on Tuesday). We knew we'd have our hands full. Obviously, they're not very happy with their game, just as we were a few games ago (in a 6-4 loss to the Winnipeg Jets on Thursday). I like the way we started, and we stuck with it. I think we checked our way to some goals, which was really important. Then down the stretch, the penalty kill came up right big. I thought 'Quicky' had a real good night. Overall, a real good night.

> Well, you've got to take what you're given. I think early in the year we were forcing some stuff and still getting rewarded. Tonight, we took what was there. You have to read quick and take what's there. Our team did a better job tonight on that than we have.

> Had a couple of chances there, and it was nice to get two goals tonight. I just try to stay open. It's always fun to score.
