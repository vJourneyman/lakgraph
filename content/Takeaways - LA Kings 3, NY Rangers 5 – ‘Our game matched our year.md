## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> We had a real good push in the first; I thought we were an aggressive team, we were on our toes a little bit, we were connecting passes and plays.

> Teams get the opportunity to regroup between periods, and the good, consistent teams are able to keep it at an even keel. They also scored at the 18-minute mark in the third period, so a lot of that set us back, but we were able to regain it in the third. We didn’t have it between the first and second.

> Yes, he does. \[[[Cal Petersen]]] has to make that save … Sometimes it’s the one that you need, rather than all the ones you made, that makes a difference in the game, and we needed that one.
