## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> When we brought \[[[Kevin Fiala]]] in, we brought him to play in that spot. We just had to settle some things down and get him fitting in and comfortable. He and I talked the other day, he said he feels way better about language, systems, structure and teammates, surroundings, so that’s a good sign.

> It helped Kevin and you get the third pair or you get the third line for the most part. And if you get the job done, let’s face it, it’s an easier task for the most part, so hopefully that’ll help you. \[[[Gabe Vilardi]]] has played a lot of minutes, not double but significantly more, against tougher competition on a more consistent basis, from 21 games in 39 nights. Not an easy task.
