## Summary
> In hockey, as in life, there are archetypes built on hyperbole and buzzwords which are designed to fit every player into a pre-defined box. Scouts and evaluators often fall prey to lazily characterizing young prospects in this way: the power forward, the two-way centre, the speedy winger, the one-dimensional scorer, the elusive European, the stay-at-home defenceman. But sometimes, just sometimes, there’s a player who is so uniquely different from everyone else in approach or in ability that you can’t help but notice him. These players have mastered their skill and used it to set themselves apart. The Gifted is a 10-part series which examines through video the NHL’s most fascinating prospects and the unique skillsets that define them.
