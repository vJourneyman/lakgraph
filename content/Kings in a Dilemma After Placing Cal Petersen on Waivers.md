## Summary
> After a 9-8 debacle against the Seattle Kraken on Nov. 29, the Los Angeles Kings placed goaltender [[Cal Petersen|Calvin Petersen]] on waivers the following day. Petersen didn’t start the game but allowed four goals on 16 shots, and some were really ugly. He obviously didn’t get waived because of one bad performance but rather a series of poor outings this season. However, it was still surprising to see him put on waivers, as it leaves a lot of questions about the future for both him and the Kings.
