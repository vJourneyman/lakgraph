## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> It’s a very, very confusing night for all of us. I’m really disappointed that we gave up nine goals, absolutely, but on the other side of the coin, I’m glad that we fought back, got a point and scored eight. So it’s mass confusion for all of us and we better freakin’ figure it out quickly.
