## Summary
> This edition of the Los Angeles Kings will never be confused with the most dynamic offensive team. They lack the firepower upfront of the best teams in the league. They overcame this last season and made the playoffs, albeit they averaged the second-fewest goals per game of any team to participate in the postseason. The Kings came to rely on [[Adrian Kempe]] to pot some goals, and he netted 35 last year in a breakout season. Heâ€™s currently going through a slump, and we need to figure out why that is the case.
