## Notes and Quotes
### [[Gabe Vilardi]]
> It was a tied up draw, I tied up my guy and Kopi ended up winning it. Eddy took a shot and it went wide and I kind of read that it was going wide. I got a lucky bounce, it came out just on the other side of the goal line. I knew that \[Bobrovsky] was coming late to the post, so I just tried to beat him under the glove and it ended up going in.

### [[Trevor Moore]]
> Ups and downs in that game, it was good offensively and Quickie was great, but there’s some stuff to button up defensively and we know that. We’re working on it and we’re getting better.

### [[Matt Roy]]
> You can look at the video. It's a dirty play. You can see him poke Quickie in the eye there. Hopefully, the league takes a look at it. It's a dirty play. Hopefully, the video gets out and they can look at it.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> That’s what he does. It makes him a good player, it makes him a villain. Do we like the poking in \[Quick]’s facemask? Of course, we don’t, but I don’t think it’s anything that we can deal with. Now other people have to look at it.
