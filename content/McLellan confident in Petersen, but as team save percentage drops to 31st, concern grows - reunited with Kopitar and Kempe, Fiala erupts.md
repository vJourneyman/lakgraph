## Summary
> Through 22 games, any iteration of the phrase “our game tonight has matched our year where we’re inconsistent,” as Todd McLellan described Tuesday’s 5-3 loss to the New York Rangers, leaves a more permanent imprint in whichever direction this 2022-23 season is heading.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Yes he does. Cal has to make that save. Cal made some outstanding saves.

> I would say there’s concern, yeah. But you also qualified it as I would (as a reflection of team game), that when we mishandle a puck on the blue line and give up a breakaway, that’s a pretty damn good save. When a goaltender loses a stick, for whatever reason we break two sticks and he’s got to dive across, that’s a pretty damn good save. He made a really good one on Panarin in the first period, so he’s making some really good saves. So is Jonathan. But we’ve got to as a group work on that save percentage. Not just the goaltenders, but as a group we’ve got to bring that number up.

> Yes. We’re confident in \[[[Cal Petersen]]].

> you’re always going to be a step slow, either physically or mentally if you’re thinking the game.

> When I say that, I’m not demeaning [[Gabe Vilardi|Gabriel Vilardi]]’s play. He’s been really good. It’s just a different mix tonight, a different energy on that line, and I thought that line gave us a game that maybe we hadn’t seen in a little bit.

### [[Kevin Fiala]]
> I think we just stopped playing. The first period we had a lot of shots on net, we didn’t give them anything defensively. In the second, especially, I feel like they had a lot of free guys on the back side they were playing, so they were always kind of open. We also let them get in our zone pretty easily, and that should be our strength to keep them away from us. It’s just not our game – learn from it and get better next game.
