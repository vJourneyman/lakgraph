## Notes and Quotes
Includes powerplay video breakdown

### [[Anze Kopitar]]
> Being down 3-0 after the first period certainly doesn’t help. But the thing is, you know, the period, as bad as the score was, I didn’t think our play was that bad. Just a couple of tough breaks and we were down 3-0, and you’re obviously playing catch up, you’re trying to make something happen, and it didn’t happen tonight.

> It wasn’t meant to be tonight

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> When I look at the start we had, I thought we played the way we wanted to play. We played fast, we were aggressive, we forced them into situations where they had to turn the puck over, and things were going pretty well for us. Even after the first goal, I thought we responded well, but by the time it got to three, unfortunately, it wasn’t the same way anymore, and obviously, we’d like to have a couple of those back in the first period.

> We’re trying, just like we would with forwards and defensemen, to get (Petersen) to where he can be, and he has to be better. I can’t stand here and bull\*hit you guys, it is what it is. There are others that have to be better as well in certain situations, but we had the momentum, and we couldn’t close it.
