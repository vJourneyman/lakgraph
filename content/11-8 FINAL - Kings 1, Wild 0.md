## Summary
> Heading into Tuesday night's matchup against the Minnesota Wild, the Kings were coming off of an eventful 5-4 victory over the Florida Panthers. Not to mention the last time the Wild and Kings faced off in mid-October, the teams combined for 13 goals. So more of the same, right? Wrong, very wrong.
