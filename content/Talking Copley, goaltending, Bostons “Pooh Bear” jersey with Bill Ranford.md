## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> We have three that we believe can play.  Pheonix right now is playing outstanding after Tuesday’s win over Anaheim.

>  Quickie and Cal, they need help, too. Our team’s playing better right now in front of Pheonix than we did in front of the other two, and when it’s time for Quickie to go back in, or Cal, or whoever it might be, I certainly expect that. I’m sure the players expect that type of performance in front of them, as well.

### [[Pheonix Copley]]
> Every time I get a chance, I want to try do the best I can with it, regardless of what’s going on around me, so it’s just my mindset, so that’s what I’ll continue to do.

> There’s definitely times where I guess of self-doubt and wondering. You work really hard for a long time for a chance to come around, and you can’t really predict when that’ll happen. For sure, yeah, there are times when you’re wondering, ‘when am I going to break through? When am I going to get an opportunity?’ But you’ve just got to keep going. That’s my mindset – it’s just to keep working and keep trying to earn opportunities.
