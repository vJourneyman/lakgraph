## Summary
> What didn’t that homestand have, eh Insiders?
> 4-2 wins over the Tampa Bay Lightning and Toronto Maple Leafs, sandwiched around a 6-4 loss against the Winnipeg Jets. Wins on Tuesday and Saturday saw the Kings play as close to the brand of hockey they want to play as we’ve seen all season. Thursday’s defeat was perhaps as frustrating a night as we’ve watched, a defeat that led to the Kings not only expressing the necessity to make changes stylistically, but actually further that by changing their alignment heading into Saturday’s homestand finale, the first real shakeup of the season.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Even that might have been different from well, he was a lot cleaner. There wasn’t anything that was seeping through him to the backside. You know, Puck pucks hit him in the square. He looked confident you know just a lot of really good things. He looked the way he should look. And now he’s like our team where can we consistently do it night after night?
