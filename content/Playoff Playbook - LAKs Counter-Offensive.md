## Summary
> The Los Angeles Kings are a game away from upsetting the high-powered Edmonton Oilers.
> 
> Through five games, LAK is not widely outplaying EDM (15 goals for, 21 against), but has managed to eke out wins by keeping the game tight at 5v5 (11GF, 11GA) and out-working EDM at critical moments, especially off neutral-zone turnovers.
