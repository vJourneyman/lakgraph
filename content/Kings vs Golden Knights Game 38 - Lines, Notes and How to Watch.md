## Notes and Quotes
### [[Quinton Byfield]]
> Definitely, super excited to be back here (in the NHL). Playing with the Reign it was good, building confidence, scoring, playing a lot that was very nice. And you just want to bring that over here and contribute. 
> I'm just focused on playing my game. Just want to do your job, there's obviously a role you have to play but you want to be the player you've always been.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> \[[[Arthur Kaliyev]]] is on IR, [[Trevor Moore]] won't play tonight and I don't know if he'll be available the next game.
