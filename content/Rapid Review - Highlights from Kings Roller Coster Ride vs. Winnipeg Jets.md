## Summary
> Perhaps an apt description for Thursday night’s loss by the Kings was a thrilling — yet ultimately disappointing — roller coaster ride. After jumping out to a quick lead and dominating the first period, LA somehow managed to go into the first intermission only up 3-2 after controlling the time of possession and leading on the shot clock 17-6. It only got worse, as the highlights will support.
