## Notes and Quotes
### [[Kevin Fiala]]
> I feel like we had so many chances. Just didn't go our way. Hit bars, posts. We had so many long offensive shifts where we couldn't connect, but we stuck together and kept going and kept going, and that's how it turns out.

> It was a tight game from both teams. Both goaltenders played unbelievable. It was kind of a playoff game, you know, and it's nice that we won.

### [[Phillip Danault]]
> This is more Kings hockey right now. We're playing good defensively, which creates frustration with the other team, and we create some chances on our side, so that's Kings hockey right now.
