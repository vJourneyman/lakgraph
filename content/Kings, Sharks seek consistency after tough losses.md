## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Our game tonight has matched our year, where we’re inconsistent, we’re up and down. Whether it’s within a game, whether it’s two-game segments, one-game segments, back-to-backs, we’re still searching for that.

### [[Kevin Fiala]]
> Yeah, disappointed. Going into the lead like that, 2-0 in the first, got to find a way to keep going, you know? There’s no reason to step off the gas.

> I think we just stopped playing. In the first period we had a lot of shots on net. We didn’t give them anything defensively. … It’s just another game. Got to learn from it and get better the next game.
