## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> We’re aware of it and we have been for years, we haven’t had a lot of success against San Jose with their penalty kill and a lot of teams in the league are in that situation. I think this started when Pete de Boer was here, they had a system that they installed and it’s worked well for them. Even as the coaching changes have happened, they’ve maintained it, it’s a sign of a really strong belief in a system and instruction. The players that they’re using on it are accustomed to it, it’s not like they’re learning anything new. It’s a big part of the game when you play against the Sharks.

### [[Trevor Moore]]
> We’ve looked a lot of what they do here. I don’t know if they’re top in the league, but they’re at 92 percent or something like that, they’re really good. They have a strong stand at the blue line and they come with a lot of pressure, so it’s a big challenge for us, but I think we’re ready for it.

### [[Sean Durzi]]
> One of the best penalty kills in the league now, so it’s something you look at, you know it and you’re aware of it. We’ve got to bring it, special teams are a big part of wins. Focusing on what we do well and being on the same page is something that we continue to work on but when you’re going game by game, you’ve got to look at the other team and what they do well. If they’re at the top, they’re obviously doing something right.

> Just what our team does well, our systems and kind of flowing back to that part. If I can be in my position, I’ve been kind of working my way out from there. So positionally sound, move pucks quick and kind of keep it simple at the start.

> Yeah, it was a different sort of view. I went up top there and you can see the overhead of how things are playing out. Our neutral zone, d-zone. powerplay, things like that with a different view. Obviously you want to be on the ice but you try to find positives for missing a few and work to learn, work to get better and pick up a few things that our team does and opposite teams, you can learn from guys all over. I was just learning, watching and studying the game from a different angle.
