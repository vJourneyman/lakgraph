## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Really important shift. They had scored, I think, it was two or three minutes after we got a little momentum back, got our forecheck going again. Which fell off in the second period, I thought. It was a simple goal, we tried to make a lot of homerun passes halfway through the game through the middle of the rink. We finally played north, went to the pads a couple of times and [[Jaret Anderson-Dolan|JAD]] found a rebound. It was a timely goal, it got us back on track, evened up the game and it was from our fourth line. A lot of real positives there.

### [[Jordan Spence]]
> Yeah, I also think I know what to expect up in the NHL with the experience I had last year. So, for me I just wanted to gain some weight, get bigger, a little strong, bigger, faster. So, obviously, it's going to take some time but I'm happy with the progress I had this summer.
