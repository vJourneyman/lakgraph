## Summary
> Thit team, it increasingly seemed during the seventh 4-0-0 home stand in franchise history, was clearly passing the eye-test and data-test and disentangling the detail and structural issues that hindered their forecheck. They also showed that they’re attacking the typical early-season inconsistency to a better efficacy than recent opponents (several of whom, it should be noted, have been beset by key injury woes). It’s all a very meandering way of saying for the third straight game they stepped on their opponents’ throats during five-on-five action other than a few shifts each night.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> You can get satisfaction and do a lot of other things, and Kevin helps that they keep doing those things. His playmaking skills help those other two maybe get more scoring chances. But the other two help him in getting the puck back, so it’s a good combination.
