## Notes and Quotes
- ### First-period passing ‘was atrocious’
- ### Kaliyev on the powerplay
- ### Over just like that

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Our passing was atrocious. But our thought process into where we were setting the pucks and passing was even worse. So, you combine that with those two things together and we were making it fairly easy on them.

### [[Arthur Kaliyev]]
> Retrieving pucks, we did a really good job of that after getting shots. We started the power play and we didn’t convert on those shots, but we got it back and we made something out of it. Great plays by Arvy, Phil, everyone.
