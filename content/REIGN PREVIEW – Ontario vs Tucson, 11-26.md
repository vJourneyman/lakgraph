## Summary
> The Ontario Reign will go up against the Tucson Roadrunners for the first time this season Saturday night at Toyota Arena, beginning a two-game series this weekend in Ontario. Last season, on their way to a second place finish in the Pacific Division the Reign posted a 5-2-1-0 record against Tucson, while the Roadrunners did not qualify for the postseason. This season has been different for the Arizona Coyotes’ affiliate, as the club is tied with Ontario for third place. Each team has nine wins and 19 points in 15 contests so far this year. The two teams will once again play against each other eight times during the 2022-23 regular season.
