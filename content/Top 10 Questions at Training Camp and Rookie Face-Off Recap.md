- Well rounded; Very good defensively with offensive instincts and great sharing
- Gets overlooked in the prospect pool
- Was playing significant minutes at the end of last season due to Kings injuries and was able to handle it
- Jesse mentions that it's easy to stop after thinking of [[Jordan Spence]], [[Helge Grans]], and [[Brandt Clarke]], who were either high profile picks, AHL standouts, or were in the AHL for a full year
- Kim Nousiainen wasn't even playing on the continent until the end of the year
- Slightly undersized but aggressive and skates extremely well
