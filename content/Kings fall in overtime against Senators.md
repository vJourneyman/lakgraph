## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> We sure didn’t start the game very well. The power play, obviously, gave us some life, it gave us a chance to crawl back into the game … (and) allowed us to find our game as the night went on.

> I thought we adapted, we took it up a notch in the second, certainly a notch again in the third and got it to overtime.

### [[Viktor Arvidsson]]
> \[[[Arthur Kaliyev]]]’s got a great shot, he knows where to be, we just tried to find him and today he buried two.

> \[[[Phillip Danault]]]’s underrated all over. I think he’s been a leading player for the last couple of years. He’s just a worker, he does the dirty work and he gets not enough recognition.
