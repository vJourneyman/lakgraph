## Summary
> The Kings have played, by far, the highest-scoring hockey of any team in the NHL this season. With 102 total goals, no team has seen more goals scored in their games this season than the Kings. There’s a bit of a caveat there, in that the Kings are tied for the league lead in games played, but nonetheless, LA is one of just four teams to average at least 3.4 goals both for and against on a per-game basis.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> We’re going to be who we’re going to be.

> I said in the summer – I said actually in Edmonton after game seven – that we had to work ahead of us and that every year is different. Are we going to be a high-event team every night? We better keep scoring five. If we’re going to be a high-event team and not put four or five up on the board, then we’ve got to fix some things.

> We’re trying to rein it in a little bit more and be better defensively, but at the same time, in the same breath, we’re scoring more. We’ll see. We’re our own team right now, we’re figuring it out.

> I just looked at the scores and four seems to be a common number. I personally believe it’s going to be the race to three again, at some point, because I think everybody’s going to tighten things up, but I’ve been wrong many, many times before. Fours are popping up all over the place, so the team that can get to four and really check well has a chance at the championship, I believe, right now if it stays this way.

### [[Trevor Moore]]
> I think we have a lot of young guys who are getting that confidence and we have good depth, we have four lines that can score now. When you have four lines that can score, it can roll over and you get more sustained o-zone time.
