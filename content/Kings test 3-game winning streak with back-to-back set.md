## Notes and Quotes
### [[Kevin Fiala]]
> I don’t even have to explain it. \[[[Pheonix Copley]]] just saves it and he’s bringing it all. He makes big saves, he keeps us in the game and he’s done a great job. Just positive things to say.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> This year is about taking a step forward and advancing. Are we there? We show some nights we certainly are, then we give it back a little bit. I think there are five or six teams that are consistently winning games right now and then there are some others that aren’t winning as many and then there’s a whole group of teams in the middle of the pack that are all trying to figure it out.

> We’d probably be in the middle, if you compare us to the rest of the league. We’re hoping for growth and getting better.
