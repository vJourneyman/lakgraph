## Summary
> Roster moves, Insiders!
> 
> The LA Kings have announced several transactions this morning, as they’ve trimmed their training camp roster down to 34 players.

## Notes
- [[Alex Turcotte]] and [[Andre Lee]] are injured, so can't be assigned to the minor leagues

> I think we’re working right now with five lines, ten defensemen and 2-3 goaltenders. It’s whether you have your complete lineup or whether you have excess pieces, but in my mind, the guys that are left are pretty much veterans now. It’s how it we’ll use them, how we roll them out and I think this week you’ll see teams – maybe a little different when we go to Utah just with the travel, the day-of flying in, flying all the way back – but for the other games, we’re just picking from that group. -- [[Todd McLellan]]
