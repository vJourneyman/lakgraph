## Notes and Quotes
### [[Phillip Danault]]
> I think we played one of our worst games defensively, we gave up too many rushes. We did that to ourselves and lost the game in the first period. We weren’t sharp enough mentally.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> We played some pretty shoddy hockey today and despite getting the lead, we weren’t real sharp, it showed up in a lot of different areas. We had guys miss line changes, passes through the neutral zone, we had an icing call with two seconds left, missed faceoff coverages.

> We were a shot away from at least getting a point on that night, the goaltender made a real good save, but again, I don’t think we should lose sight of how this game evolved. Just because we fought back and made it 6-5, there are a lot of things that we have to fix.
