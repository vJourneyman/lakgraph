## Notes and Quotes
### [[Trevor Moore]]
> We’ve started the year scoring quite a bit but also giving up a lot. I think our team is starting to turn around and play a little more defensive hockey, which I think most Kings fans are used to and Kings players are used to. I think that’s actually a good sign for us, when we’re in these 1-1 games versus 6-5 shootouts.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> I think it’s been a step forward every game; I don’t think \[[[Kevin Fiala]]]’s stepping back at all. He’s a very dynamic player, and good players make other players around them better and I see that too.
> He keeps a lot of plays alive (and he’s) very creative. He’s starting to figure out our system and our structure a little bit more. He’s a hell of a player.
