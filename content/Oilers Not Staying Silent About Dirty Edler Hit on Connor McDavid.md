## Summary
> The Edmonton Oilers didn’t win their game against the Los Angeles Kings on Wednesday evening. It’s not the result they wanted, but most fans and players aren’t talking about the loss as much as they are about the “extremely dangerous” hit that defenseman [[Alex Edler]] laid on Connor McDavid. It was a hit that McDavid seemed to be OK after, but it isn’t changing the opinions of many who saw the play and can’t figure out why the league isn’t stepping in.
