## Summary
> The Ontario Reign close out a stretch of three games in four nights by returning home to face the San Diego Gulls at Toyota Arena on Sunday afternoon. Ontario came up short in their first contest of the season in Bakersfield on Saturday, falling to the Condors 3-1. The Reign swept San Diego last month during a home-and-home series, winning on consecutive nights by scores of 2-1 and 5-1. Ontario is looking to regain sole possession of first place in the Pacific Division, while the Gulls will aim to secure their fifth win of the 2022-23 campaign.
