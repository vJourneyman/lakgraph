## Summary
> Like Jazz Room, another new feature! Once a weekish, we’ll become sponges and feast on the delicious microplankton of recent opponent comings-and-goings. We’ll have fun with it! Hockey is fun. Writing is fun. Transcribing 41 minutes of Dean Lombardi is fun.


## Notes and Quotes
- Jon Rosen looks ahead and gives context to the upcoming opponents of the Kings, the Vegas Golden Knights, the Seattle Kraken, and the Minnesota Wild, and the previous opponent, the Edmonton Oilers.
