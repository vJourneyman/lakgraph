## Notes and Quotes
### [[David Pagnotta]]
> Defensively, they’ve had a lot of challenges this season. There are some deficiencies in their performance, and it’s been affecting them so far this season. 
> They’ve expressed some interest, at least internally, with respect to Vladislav Gavrikov of the Columbus Blue Jackets. There will be a lot of interest in this player as the season progresses. They’re one of the teams looking at him; a big, sturdy, reliable guy, a stay-at-home type of player that can come in and help stabilize things on that backend. They could potentially move out somebody on that right side to fill that void on the left.
