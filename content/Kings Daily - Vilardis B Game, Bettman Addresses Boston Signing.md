## Summary
> Gabe Vilardi simply can't be stopped, even when he has an off night.
> When the general consensus is you didn't have your best game, on a night you scored the game winning goal, you know things are going well. And that's exactly what happened with Gabe Vilardi. Who's team leading ninth goal was the difference on Saturday night.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Gabe Vilardi]]
> Yeah, for sure. Largely, two of those goals we were on the ice. The first one there, the [[Mikey Anderson]] own goal, that starts with me, I was the high guy and I didn’t do a good job, so that goal was largely on me. The other one, I felt like I dived in and Tkachuk made a nice play, but it is nice to help the team win offensively after that game.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> He’s done a lot of good things for us, you know, he scored the winner tonight. You can’t play your best every night, it’s impossible. So what do you have in your “B” game and Gabe had a good enough “B” game to be effective tonight. He scored, we trusted him in the in the last few minutes of the game. He’s done a real good job this season.
