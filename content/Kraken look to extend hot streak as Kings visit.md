## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> For as much as you’d like to always keep your team together and not separate it, I thought there were some individuals that let us down tonight rather than the group as a whole. Sometimes you have to play the game a certain way and it might not be the way you like it.
> It might be ugly, it might be grinding, it might not be cute, but that’s the way you have to play it, and we had some that couldn’t accept that or didn’t want to, and that cost us.
