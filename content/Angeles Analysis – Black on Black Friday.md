## Summary
> Wearing their black jerseys on the road in honor of the holiday, the LA Kings defeated the California Seals by a 5-2 final yesterday evening. The Reverse Retros worn by San Jose looked pretty good, but not quite good enough to stop the Kings from snapping a 0-2-1 skid, heading into a four-game homestand.
