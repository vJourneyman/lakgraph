## Notes and Quotes
> We’ve preached and preached about it. Sometimes you’ve got to get hit pretty hard with a two-by-four. Maybe this was it. ... That is all game management. That’s getting engaged and being ready to go. Their team did a better job of it than we did tonight. -- [[Todd McLellan]]

> We wasted an outstanding goaltending night by not at least getting a point. That’s disappointing. -- [[Todd McLellan]]
