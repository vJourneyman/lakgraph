## Summary
> After a month of the 2022-23 NHL season, some teams are clearly surpassing preseason expectations while others have stumbled badly at the start.
> In this week's power rankings, we take a look at the preseason point total over/unders established by Caesars Sportsbook, and how far teams are beyond or below that mark based on their point projections.
> Ranked 14, up from 16 previously. Just 3 points off the preseason points pace prediction.
