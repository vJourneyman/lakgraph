## Summary
> What’s the easiest way to erase a disappointing road trip? In the words of Motley Crue… Home Sweet Home.
> The Kings last played at Crypto Arena on November 10 and they skated to their fourth straight home victory – with the last three coming down to a single goal margin. So, they were close. When the Rangers and Kings played a pair of games last season, it was the home team coming out on top in each game.
