## Summary
> One theme after the LA Kings’ 5-1 win over the St. Louis Blues Monday night was the ability of the team to take what was given them. There’s no right or wrong script to win a hockey game, and whether it was the three backdoor tap-ins or Jonathan Quick’s poke check to end a 3-on-0, they processed and reacted to many different game situations well.


## Players
- [[Carl Grundstrom]]
- [[Jonathan Quick]]
- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]
- [[Kevin Fiala]]

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> You’ve got to take what you’re given, and early in the year we were forcing some stuff and still getting rewarded. Tonight we took what was there.

> \[[[Carl Grundstrom]]] was physical, he was aggressive between the whistles, he played hard, finished his checks, and that crap after is secondary. He’s still involved in it, which is fine. But I like what’s going on between the whistles. That’s way more important to the team.

> I wasn’t even aware of it. The next 100 are going to be a lot tougher than the first 100, and I’m only worried about 101 which is tomorrow in Dallas and we’ll have our hands full there.

> \[[[Kevin Fiala]]] seems to be able to perform of a high level regardless of where he is. It allows with Gabe to play with some first line players for a little bit. It just feels better right now, looks better. Less chances against for the most part.

### [[Carl Grundstrom]]
> You’ve got to stand up for yourself, too. I always try to do that. I don’t always talk, but sometimes you’ve got to fight back.

### [[Viktor Arvidsson]]
> I think Quickie played unreal today. They had clear-cut chances he made crazy saves on, and other than that, I thought we played a pretty solid game.

### [[Jonathan Quick]]
> It’s like any other play – you’re kind of going through everything and what their options are, what you think they’re doing and preparing yourself for what you expect to happen.

> You’re looking for what-handed shot they are, one-timer or whatever. And then just try to be patient and make a read on what they’re doing.
> It’s like a 3-on-2. They’re still kind of looking for the same stuff. Obviously all the seams would open there, all the passing lanes are open, so everything’s an option.\[...] you do it over and over again and come out more times than not if you’re playing the right way.
