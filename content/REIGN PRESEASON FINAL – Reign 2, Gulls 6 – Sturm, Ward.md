## Summary
> In their only game of the 2022 preseason, one that was filled with special teams, the Ontario Reign fell short to the San Diego Gulls by a final score of 6-2 Saturday night at Pechanga Arena. Rookie forwards Martin Chromiak and Taylor Ward scored the tallies for Ontario, while goaltender Matt Villalta started the game and made 18 saves on 19 shots in just over 31 minutes of action.

## Notes
### [[Marco Sturm]]
> Going into a game like this, some guys have never even played a game yet. You want to try to get your legs going. You try to do the stuff we worked on all week and try to be the best player you can be. I think there’s a lot of guys who showed me and the coaching staff what they can do what they can bring for the team.

> Well, we got scored on twice on our power play and we got two or three goals against on the penalty kill, so that has to be fixed, but lots of different guys in lots of different positions today. I think there’s some areas today we have to work on. I think there’s some guys in this locker room, who will be here, who have to be better too. The season starts in a week. There’s a short turnaround and I think the guys have been going hard all week long. They deserve to have a day off tomorrow and then regroup and try to be better on Monday.

> There’s a few things that I think are in our control and I think the mistakes we made, especially the first 45 minutes, everything was on our tape. We’ve got to keep things simple first. I think everyone has to know their role on the team. You don’t have to do anything special. We’ve just got to play hard, play for the team, be a good teammate, and win some hockey games.

> I know we have a lot of toughness on our team, but I’m not looking at that. I want to play hockey. Yes, this is a big part of our team and our game, but at the end of the day, I just didn’t like the way we played. I think we had a good start and first 10 minutes, but in the end San Diego was just better than us. I think we still had enough good players in our lineup, but again, it was a good lesson for all of us. I’ll just have to make sure it’s not going to happen again.
