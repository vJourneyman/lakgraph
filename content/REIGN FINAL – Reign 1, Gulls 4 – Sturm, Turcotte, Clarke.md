## Notes and Quotes
### [[Marco Sturm]]
> It’s been four different games, but pretty similar for some reason. I think we got really comfortable. We were playing well. Give the guys credit. I think in Colorado, the second game, that was the first time we really got pushed back and we had no answer. That carried on over to San Jose. In the last two games, it was just lots of frustration because the guys are used to playing a different style of game. I think we just have to find our game back. Some guys have to realize that they have to give more and contribute to all areas of the game.

> It’s always good. They’re all good players. With \[[[Quinton Byfield]] and \[[[Alex Turcotte]]] coming back, we love it. But again, we’ve got to give them time too. You could see it with \[[[Brandt Clarke]]] too. He didn’t get to play for a while. It took him 40 minutes today to really get going. \[[[Martin Chromiak]]] too. He still needs time. We need to be patient a little bit. We try to help them get going as soon as possible.

> I think that’s part of the reason I was hired here \[in Ontario]. We believe in our system. I believe in our system, and so far we’ve done a good job but now we are getting away from our system, what made us so good. It’s just mental breakdowns. The guys work but are sometimes not smart enough. I know the guys were tired today because it was a quick turnaround, but we made mistakes today. We never really got into our structure and frustrated the other team like we have the last couple of weeks. Now it has reversed. Now we get frustrated and we totally get away from our structure. That’s something we have to show \[the players] and explain and teach. And we have to get better.
