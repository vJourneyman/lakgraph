## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> He’s back with the team, which is a great sign. He lost a lot of weight, he’s going to need to get strong again. He’ll need some time to recover.

>  I’d like to do that with Iafallo, anybody that’s out. Sammy Fagemo in the minors. Turcotte in the minors. We want to get all of them up to speed, because they’re all important players. Q’s no different than anybody else. He needs energy, he needs strength, he’s got to feel good about himself.

> I don’t think anybody should lose their spot to injury or illness. It’s out of your control. Usually you lose your spot in the lineup based on different play. So, we’ll see once everybody gets \[back]. There’s no decision that has to be made right now based on Quinton or Ras or anybody else in our lineup because he’s not ready to play.

> He’s got tremendous legs, and the ability to drive the puck to the net, or even drive deep into lanes. There’s a little more confidence in more situations. \[more opportunity for him to use his]  give-go game. ‘You’re quick, you have good legs, dish it and jump to a hole. Find that hole.’ Some of it’s experience or instincts.

> Some of them went home and still couldn’t sleep. You wake up, your sleep pattern’s broken, you jump in a car, it was cold the other night, everybody was wide awake, and you’re not getting ‘til bed until 3:30.

> A lot of times the coaching staff just sits in the locker room and we’ll go through our lineup and we’ll put arrows \[next to names]. ‘Adrian Kempe, up, flat or down? One of the three, where he’s at?’ And if you get too many down errors, you’re in trouble.
