## Summary
> As noted this morning, Viktor Arvidsson moved into the full group today for the first time during training camp, as he continues to work his way back from offseason back surgery. Joining him for his second day with Group A was Sean Durzi, who is recovering from offseason shoulder surgery. For that reason, these two players are linked, though it would be unfair to compare their timelines in any way.


## Notes and Quotes
### [[Viktor Arvidsson]]
> Nothing like this, during my last year in Nashville I had the same thing happen and I was gone for two weeks but I played that year’s playoffs,” Arvidsson said. “So this was the first time that happened this seriously.

> It was the toughest part of our jobs, I think, to play all those games and then when it matters, you can’t contribute with the guys on the team. It was really tough, me and Drew sat on the side, dreading ourselves \[for not being in there], but it happens and we had to deal with it.

> It was tough, especially for my family and for me, mentally it was really tough. I couldn’t be with my daughter, play with her, that was the toughest part about everything I think. Coming back here, I hadn’t skated, so I started to skate and felt fine and I started to look to the brighter side. I feel confident and we’ll just take it day by day now, see if I can get out of the red jersey.

> It was completely different from what I’m used to. It was a lot of just focusing on what I had to do to be ready and stuff and not a lot of family activities. It was tough at that point, but I was making sacrifices and I’m here now and I feel really good about myself.

> It’s fun, we go way back, we were roommates in Milwaukee. He’s a great guy, a great player. I think a lot of younger guys can learn from him, his skill set and how he wants to get better every day. He’s great, I really, really enjoy having him here.

> I don’t know yet, it’s day by day. We’re just trying to get me back with the players again and we’ll see how it goes

> Yeah, for sure. I didn’t see the games in Ontario the other day, but I feel like [[Gabe Vilardi|Gabe]] has taken a step with his skating and with his control of the puck. Especially offensively, he’s dangerous when he has the puck and he’s creative. Same with [[Quinton Byfield|Q]] and [[Arthur Kaliyev|Arthur]], others too, they made steps the last year and hopefully they continue to grow.

> It was a lot of fun \[to skate with the full group today]. Just good to be back.
