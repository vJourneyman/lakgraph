## Summary
> The t̶i̶m̶e̶s̶ lines, they are a-changing, Insiders.
> If last night’s promotion was Grateful Dead night as the Kings hosted Winnipeg then consider this morning’s practice to be Bob Dylan Day. Changes were certainly alluded during yesterday’s post-game press conference and we certainly got a few this morning as the Kings prepare to host Toronto tomorrow evening.

- [[Quinton Byfield]]

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Well, I think that Kevin and Gabe have a lot of similarities, they create, they have good vision and they can set people up. Right handed shot \[versus] left handed shot, that often makes a big difference. Kopi’s line, and I’m not putting this all on Kevin by any means, has been out-chanced in the majority of the games they’ve played and we can’t keep going that route. Gabe will play there tomorrow and I think Gabe can make some of the plays that Kevin makes as well, but we can try and stabilize lines and maybe it’ll help Kevin with some other linemates as well.

> Potentially. Kevin’s made some pretty good hockey plays. Juice has had a couple breakaways from the hashmarks in because of plays that Kevin made. In the offensive zone, we brought him here to be creative and to be an offensive player and with those players, there’s going to be some risk. It’s what that line is doing outside the blue line, neutral zone, d-zone that has to be a little bit better. That’s not on Fiala completely, it’s the whole group on the ice.

### [[Gabe Vilardi]]
> Not much changes for me, I’m going to still play the same way, try to play the same way. Two different guys with different skillsets, I guess, that will take some adjusting but I’ve played a little bit with them now, when we’ve mixed some things up at the end of games. Obviously Kopi is a playmaker, a big body, he’s going to protect pucks and Juice has a wicked shot. I’m just going to play my game and see what happens.

### [[Anze Kopitar]]
> His skill is through the roof. He’s got to be towards the top of the league in handling the puck in tight spaces. He’s displayed it and he very rarely loses the a stick battle. I knew the skill was always there and his hockey IQ is exceptional. He’s had a couple of bad years with injuries and we always talk about confidence, which couldn’t have been very high, but he came to camp with a mission. He’s been our best player.
