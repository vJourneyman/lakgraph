## Summary
> The Los Angeles Kings sent shockwaves throughout the NHL last week when they decided to put goaltender [[Cal Petersen]] on waivers. He eventually cleared and was assigned to the Ontario Reign of the American Hockey League (AHL). Still, the bold move by general manager (GM) [[Rob Blake]] was quite the turn of events in Los Angeles.
