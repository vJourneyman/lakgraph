## Notes and Quotes
### [[Marco Sturm]]
> It always feels good after a big win. I think we didn’t \[feel good] at the start. We were up 3-2 five minutes in but it was much too open. It’s the first game, I know everyone was excited and everyone wanted to get going, but after that we decided to gamble and started to play to our identity and came up with big goals. Overall, it was a big team effort today. Even after bad, ugly hits, guys stepped up. Even skilled guys like Lias \[Andersson] and \[Jacob Moverare]. It was good to see.

> It always helps when you get the guys back, especially the first unit. They know each other really well, so they know where to be and they support each other really well. They’re threats all over the place. It starts on the point with Spence, and then goes down to the flank. Kupari was a nice addition in the middle. There were lots of good things with the other units as well. Special teams will be very important down the stretch because there will be a lot of penalties to kill as well.

> I think he’s our best player, and on a lot of teams, the best players are captain. That’s why we named him captain, but we believe in him too. I think he also has to grow and learn how to be a captain as well. He’s up for the challenge. He’s working on it every day, and that’s what we like. He showed it today. The guys love him. He brings a lot to the team and the guys will stick up for him.

> He’s really good. He’s a good goalie but an even better person. His work ethic is one of the best I’ve seen from a goalie and I know the guys like him. He played big tonight. He stopped a few breakaways at the right time, and that’s what we need. I think every team wants a good goalie and I think we have one with him and Matthew Villalta. It was nice to see him with a big one tonight.

> I was surprised today too. Playing in the NHL, he probably wouldn’t try that move. It might work, yes, but if it doesn’t, then you’re probably in the doghouse. But here it was good for him. He tried it and ended up with a really nice highlight goal. When you play defense, everything is quick, so he doesn’t have that many touches in a game. It was nice to see him makes some plays and score that goal. Overall, I think he played really well. He was just a very good presence on the ice. All of those guys, especially the NHL guys, make a big difference.

### [[T.J. Tynan]]
> Honestly, I don’t think we started very well. I think we found our game as it went on and obviously we have a lot of talent in that room. It was kind of a sloppy night but we’ll get better. We’ll take 8 goals, obviously, and the two points, so we’ll keep going from there.

> It was great. Obviously the most important thing is winning and that’s what we did. Brett Sutter was here for a long time. Those are big shoes that I’ll probably never fill. He was an amazing player, person, and teammate. He’s the best ever. For me, it’s just about being myself. I’ve got a lot of support in that room with the older guys and younger guys. We have a tight-knit group. It’s obviously an honor but the two points are what matters, and that’s what we got tonight.

> It’s been a treat. He’s been awesome. Every day, you’re going to work. He’s been there and he’s done it, so he knows. He’s somebody that you can pick his brain. He’s a good teacher and as players, that’s what you want. You want honest, you want to learn, and that’s what we’re going to do this year. We’re going to get better each day and that’s something everyone’s excited to see.

> You’re not going to find me complaining, right? He’s unbelievable. You can see it. I think everyone in the building can see it. I just think he’s incredible. Obviously, its nice. Last year, guys stepped up when he wasn’t here, but having him back tonight, he showed what an incredible talent he is.

> They make it easy, right? They’re amazing players and its good to see them get on the board early. For me, it’s just about using my skill set to try to get them pucks where they’re comfortable and where they like it. You get Lias the puck around the net and good things are going to happen. I actually missed Sammy a couple of times today, but if you can get him some pucks, he’s got a heck of a shot. We were okay tonight, obviously we scored a couple goals, but hopefully we get better and better each day.
