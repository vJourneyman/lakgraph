## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> \[[[Anze Kopitar]]] was tremendous tonight. He's been good all along, sometimes the goals coming off his tape aren't there, but he's done things this year. And this second go around with \[[Kevin Fiala]] there is starting to feel more comfortable for the three of them.

> We wanted to see where we were at with lefties and righties. We haven't been able to do that all year and \[[[Tobias Bjornfot]]] drew that straw. He's been real good in the American League and he was solid tonight. He plays well when he uses his legs when he's active. He's up and he's back, he's closing. If he's just kind of standing around waiting for things to come to him it doesn't go real well and today he used his legs real well.

> I thought that's the best I've seen \[[[Samuel Fagemo]]] play this year. If anybody was here this morning we talked about his training camp; we were really hoping he'd be here full-time. He didn't have the camp we anticipated he would and I'm sure himself. So, that's the best game I've seen Sammy play exhibition and regular season this year so hats off to him for having an impact.

> It's one of the most confusing things that all players have. You can be [[Quinton Byfield]] and be the second overall pick and have a lot to learn. Be a dominant offensive guy in a teenagers league, and then you get here. First of all, you're not taking away anybody's job right away. Even Connor McDavid didn't do that. And then you have to have a B game you can bring, something else you can bring because the odds of you scoring and being real effective offensively right off the bat, night after night aren't as great as they would be if you were playing against teenagers. So, that happens there. Sammy coming up, you have to adjust your game. You train to have a backup game and you've got to be able to play with that.
