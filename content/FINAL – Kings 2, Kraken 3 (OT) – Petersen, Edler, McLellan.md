## Notes and Quotes
### [[Alex Edler]]
> Yeah, it was a battle from start to finish. They’re a very fast team, they come hard, they don’t give you a lot of time or space. I think we played alright, but it was one of those games that just went to overtime and they got extra point.

> I just think playing with \[[Matt Roy]] is easy. He’s solid, he’s easy to read off and he makes my job easy.

> We were in the \[offensive zone] for a bit, so you want to try to keep it in there if you can so they can’t change. You get tired playing in your own end, so I just tried to keep the puck in the zone.

> I don’t know, maybe, but that’s nothing we think about. Every single team in this league, they go through stretches with a lot of games. Being tired, it’s never an excuse in this league. Whether it’s a back-to-back, or you played a lot of games lately, you have to come out and battle and execute your system. The good teams win, even they play back-to-back or have a lot of games.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> Yeah, it wasn’t the cleanest because the other team sometimes gets in the way, they played really hard. I thought it was a really hard, heavy game for both teams, evenly played. We made the last mistake and they capitalized on it. To come up with a point in a back-to-back game, especially coming from behind, we’ll take that. It was a hard night.

> Size, game management skills, poise. \[[[Matt Roy]] and [[Alex Edler]]] are pretty good players, they defend really well. I thought Alex Edler had a tremendous night, especially back-to-back, and Matt Roy played his typical game. That pair was really solid.

> I think we did. Still, we’re creating chances and we’re not finishing, but we’ve come to expect a lot of goals early in the year, they were going in for us. The number of chances we created last night in Vancouver and tonight, if we keep doing that it will eventually go our way.

> I thought both goalies played well. \[[[Cal Petersen]]] made some tremendous saves, Jones kept them in it when mistakes went against them. Both goalies did what they had to do, that’s why the game went to overtime in a low-scoring, hard-fought match

> Yes, we’re taking it right now, there are other teams that are 10 days behind us though, they’ll get it at some point and we have to be playing them, so we need to take advantage of it. At the end, we all play 82 games, it’s just how it’s dispersed, when it’s dispersed and where. There will be times where certain teams are tired and other teams are fresh. To get a point in this situation was good for us. I thought we really had to dig in to get that point. We’ll rest tomorrow and then we’ll get ready for another tough week.
