## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> The answer to that question is yes. But by answering that it looks like I'm accusing other goaltenders of not doing their job. And that's not the case. Quickie ([[Jonathan Quick]]) and Cal (\[[[Cal Petersen]]]), they need help too. Our team is playing better right now in front of Pheonix in front of the other two. And when it's time for Quickie to go back in, or call, or whoever it might be. I certainly expect, and I'm sure the players expect that type of performance in front of them as well. So, the simple answer is yes, but it's not an accusatory answer.

> I think that's fair to say. Very relaxed in the net, it doesn't look like \[[[Pheonix Copley]]]'s panicking at any point. He's just making saves and he's getting up and doing it all over again. Probably a good observation, I think that makes us feel comfortable.

> Boy, the games changed a lot if that's unfriendly. Holy boy. Just think back I'm sure to this rivalry, I wasn't here for it, but I know the San Jose, LA Anaheim of 10 years ago, that was unfriendly. I'm not sure I would call this that unfriendly.

### [[Sean Durzi]]
> \[[[Pheonix Copley]]]'s an awesome guy. He's really calm, he's a true professional, takes care of himself every single day. And really, those are the kind of guys you want to watch and you want to learn off of. I think, he kind of does his thing very quietly and I think the guys can build off that.

> That's awesome, that's the rivalry we've got between these guys. I'd be surprised if there was none of that in this game. To see some guys step up, Arty ([[Arthur Kaliyev]]) took a few shots there and got into the mix a little bit, which is awesome to see. And, he blocked a big shot at the end. And \[[[Mikey Anderson]]], obviously, standing up for himself after he takes a hit at the end. And the guy's obviously had his back. You saw five guys in the pile and it's just the rivalry we've got with those guys, you love to see it.
