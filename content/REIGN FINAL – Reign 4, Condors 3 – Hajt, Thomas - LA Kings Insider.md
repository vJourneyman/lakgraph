## Summary
> A four-goal outburst in the second period was enough for the Ontario Reign (6-1-0) to skate past the Bakersfield Condors (2-3-1) and win their fifth consecutive game by a score of 4-3 on Saturday night at Toyota Arena. Akil Thomas led the way with two power play tallies that both came with assists by captain TJ Tynan and Jacob Moverare picked up two helpers in the victory.
