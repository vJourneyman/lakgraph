## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> They're (Hurricanes) a tough team to play against. They play at a high pace both with and without the puck, which makes them hard in all three zones. I thought we were prepared for it, it took us a little while to figure it out. But, when you fall behind with that kind of pressure to it's tough to come back. We were hurt tonight by long plays, stuff leaving their end, and getting skated. Again, we knew that was going to be part of their game, but they still executed it. When we had those opportunities we didn't quite finish on them. So, as a result, you end up with the result we got.

> For sure it was a fun experience for me. I think I got a really good pass up the middle and I got the second breakaway of the game, so I tried to be more patient and then saw the puck go in. Of course, it was a special feeling but it sucked that the team lost.

> I think I saw some space to shoot it, but I think the first one was bad luck. Hit the post and then you have to try something new. It was of course fun to see the second one go in.
