## Summary
> The LA Kings have already made one big splash this off-season when they acquired Kevin Fiala from the Minnesota Wild. In order to cement the deal, Los Angeles then promptly signed the 25 year old winger to a seven-year contract extension. 
> As a result, the Kings do not have the salary cap flexibility they had a couple of weeks ago. And with multiple RFAâ€™s needing new deals, LA does not seem like a club that is a prime candidate to be big players in free agency.
