## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> For us it's trying lefty-righty, putting Durz ([[Sean Durzi]]) on his strong side. \[[[Tobias Bjornfot]]] should feel comfortable with \[[Matt Roy]] he should feel comfortable with the guys in the locker room, with the coaches and it should be a drop him in and get a few good games out of him. He's played very well at the American league level and we want to see that transfer over to the NHL level. We believe in him and I think he feels really good about his game right now. So we'll see how that goes.

> \[[[Samuel Fagemo]]] is coming up and he's going to get his opportunity now to inject some life and energy into the lineup. I didn't think Sami had the type of training camp he needed to have so this is a real good opportunity for him.
