## Notes and Quotes
### [[Jonathan Quick]]
> We did all the little things right. I think we only took one penalty tonight, especially when you're playing against a team that is as good on the power play as they are, so trying to limit the chances there. And then blocked shots, clean rebounds, and limiting their chances, I think that goes a long way.

### [[Todd McLellan]]
> \[[[Gabe Vilardi]]]'s scoring. He's responsible defensively. He's a big body that keeps plays alive. So to this point, he's fit in really well.

> It was one of those nights where, if the power play had been sharp, you could have been up 3-0. It could have been 1-0 two minutes into the third period. They were on the power play, fresh ice, and a chance to regroup.
> But the adjustment between second and third, mentally, was really important for our team. Obviously, it didn't go well on the power play. We were all a little bit frustrated. Break came, we reloaded.

### [[Matt Roy]]
> The last game we played against them was pretty crazy, back and forth. It's kind of been like that throughout the years, so it's good to put up a goose egg and play good in front of 'Quickie.'
