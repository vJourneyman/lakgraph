## Summary
> The approach has changed here as we hit Day 6 of training camp. While nothing is set in stone, and we’ll expect to see select players shuffled up and down between Group A and Group B, today was our first real look at a true split between players targeted for the NHL and players targeted for the AHL. Group B consisted of five lines and nine defensemen, all of whom are players who are expected to at the very least compete for a full-time roster spot.


## Notes and Quotes
> Cal received treatments today, we don’t think it’s anything serious but it’s obviously something we don’t want to fool around with, he would be day-to-day. We’re not anticipating a long injury, but who knows….Durzi is getting close to joining our group, I assume, and he’s starting to extend his rehab into more contact. Arvidsson is doing really well, still some time and Turcotte is working hard to get back, he’s feeling better. -- [[Todd McLellan]]

> I want to play every game, that’s my goal for this year,” he said earlier today. “That’s the goal at least, to prove that I can play in every game. Playing in the playoffs was a great experience and I’ll take a lot of that confidence with me into this season.

> In my mind, he has grown every year. There was a time really early, maybe three or four years ago, where I think he was very confident but maybe didn’t have all the tools yet to display that. Then, it’s hard to get it back sometimes. -- [[Todd McLellan]]

> I think he’s gotten better every year, he’s shown that he’s very capable of playing in high pressure situations, in playoffs last year. Even leading up to that, yeah he wasn’t in the lineup for a couple of nights but there were other reasons for that. We think he can be a full-time player and be an effective full-time player. -- [[Todd McLellan]]
