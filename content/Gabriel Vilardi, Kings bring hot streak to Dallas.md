## Summary
> Gabriel Vilardi wasn’t even assured of a roster spot when the Los Angeles Kings opened training camp in September.
> However, the 23-year-old center has exceeded expectations right from the start this season, and the Kings will look for him to stay hot when they visit the Dallas Stars on Tuesday night.

## Notes and Quotes
### [[Todd McLellan]]
> It’s really refreshing to see him walk into the rink, he’s sticking his chest out a little, he’s smiling more, he seems to be enjoying the whole package. He’s earned the opportunity to feel that way, and as a result, he’s playing that way.

### [[Gabe Vilardi]]
> I had more to prove this year. I just worked hard this summer and I’ve taken the same mentality into the season. So far it’s been good, but a small sample size. I want to be a good player for a long time.
