## Notes and Quotes
### [[Adrian Kempe]]
> They actually do, but it's not as crazy as over here.

> One was a breakaway, I think that was my second one.

> That was a one-timer from the slot.

> It was cool. It was my rookie year too and pretty early on, so it was a good feeling to score all three in the same period, so it was cool and very exciting.

> It always feels good to score in Anaheim, so to get all three was great. We ended up losing in OT, so it kind of sucked \[with the result] but other than that it was a good feeling.

> I had chances for a hat trick that night. Could've been a back-to-back one but unfortunately not.
