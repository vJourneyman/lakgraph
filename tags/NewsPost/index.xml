officially part of it we went back to our original numbers in the American Hockey League guys are more uh present if you will because again when you&amp;rsquo;re still considered big-league guys are there&amp;rsquo;s more longing for the potential to obey there obviously is still the kind of the thought they want to get called up you want to get brought back but you also know that right now the realities are set in a bit and that&amp;rsquo;s when you can start to really focus on your present really focus on where you are at the time being and I thought that happened I think Marco, heider, and Schulz have been doing an excellent job of staying with us staying on top of us making sure we understand that we&amp;rsquo;re the Ontario Reign right now and I thought today was a great first
