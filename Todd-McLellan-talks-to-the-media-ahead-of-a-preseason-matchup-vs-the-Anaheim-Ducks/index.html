the full group play together or is it
more about the music people well as we
get we&rsquo;ve got four left and play every
second night
um we&rsquo;re still trying to evaluate some
of the question marks they need to
continue to play but we have to make
sure now that the team is up and running
and by the end of the training camp the
veterans should all have three to four
games for sure
um
maybe not quite today but moving forward
you&rsquo;d like to see all your units
together at one point
uh pairs using uh they&rsquo;re playing with
each other on the penalty kill I think
that&rsquo;s important but we still got a game
or two here to evaluate and try and give
opportunity to some and um
every player has a lifeline and
some players have extended there&rsquo;s
others it&rsquo;s shrunk on them but this is
the week
does venue play a role in the preseason
or as a first game first preseason game
of crypto because that did teach you
anything uh it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily help
teach I don&rsquo;t think but
uh a common theme around the league as
you dress a few more veterans
um at home you don&rsquo;t have to travel
alone
to wherever you&rsquo;re going
um and they play big big minutes during
the year
alleviate travel I think you&rsquo;re seeing
that so tenancy is that the home team
at points has a stronger lineup or more
veteran type lineup because that&rsquo;s where
you want to play those individuals and
Rogue team tends to be a little younger
or
guys that haven&rsquo;t played quite as much
or won&rsquo;t play as much during the year so
I I think that&rsquo;s a tendency around the
league
um that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re seeing again this
year
it&rsquo;s not the big night for Sean Walker
you can actually kind of get back into
it here with whatever maybe not
necessarily Sean but speaking from a
general standpoint
is there a trade a trait about
you you said you refer to him as someone
that kind of has had a pitbull
for players like him those are a move
undrafted those have maybe been whole
is there something about them in
particular that
I don&rsquo;t know really drives them
whatsoever that that&rsquo;s okay yeah this is
a good question and a good observation
so um obviously walks and and we talked
about
I think about a week ago 10 days ago
about the undrafted players that have
been able to come through here playing
and these are the ones that have stuck
with it and committed and bullied their
way into teams lineups
um there&rsquo;s a whole bunch that haven&rsquo;t
done that but the ones that have
um have that
constitutiveness that determination
I&rsquo;m going to prove you wrong every night
and if you tell me I can&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll show you
I can
mentality and when you look at the mazat
Walker
ifollo those types of players they play
that way I think most nights they&rsquo;re
personal makeup reflects their fight to
get into the league and stay in the
league and they they play that way and
that&rsquo;s probably why I use the word
pitbull with with Locker there&rsquo;s a scent
maybe a little not to compare but do you
see where there&rsquo;s a little bit of more
of a sense where it&rsquo;s like you can&rsquo;t
take things for granted the the
entitlements used in our society
everywhere not not in just in the LA
Kings locker room or in the NHL it&rsquo;s all
it&rsquo;s all over the place
um
and those individuals are not entitled
they don&rsquo;t feel like they&rsquo;ve been given
anything they&rsquo;ve had to fight and
continue to prove
sometimes at the other end of the scale
people will look and say well they&rsquo;ve
been given everything and they&rsquo;ve been
entitled in nine lives type scenario for
different individuals under different
circumstances but the whole group that
we&rsquo;re talking about zero entitlement
so if you look at a guy over on his
offside from a coaching standpoint where
where do you like what concerns do you
have well for a guy like what he can or
cannot do a planning options
it&rsquo;s I think it&rsquo;s individual
um comfort
when you do that some cans some can&rsquo;t
and for a whole bunch of different
reasons based on the individual the the
pivot the ability to see things uh
getting around the puck to shoot it
um confidence to play over there and
there is there isn&rsquo;t a single variable
that that they all fall into it&rsquo;s
different for everyone
um
Alex said there&rsquo;s played in the league
for
however long he&rsquo;s played I don&rsquo;t know 15
16 years
he feels good over there he just goes
and stands over that&rsquo;s what he does so
his ability to change now would be
harder than something that hasn&rsquo;t done
it there&rsquo;s another variable
so your your questions a good one but I
can&rsquo;t answer it
specifically because I think every demon
takes on different
these different variables that come into
play there
you mentioned
you hold the equipment I&rsquo;m obviously you
got sick right now but what do you need
to see from him to make that a reality
what does he need to earn that extra ice
time
well he&rsquo;s got a Beat
um some other centermen we&rsquo;re going to
play in the center he&rsquo;s going to be take
ice time away from those other
individuals it&rsquo;s a tough task on our
team when you look at copy and you look
at what Phil does and how hard lizzo
plays and the the effect he had so uh
anyway you cut it there&rsquo;s 60 Minutes a
night certain games roll out with power
plays and penalty kills but at the end
of the day you&rsquo;ve got to start grabbing
minutes from other people
so his minutes could go up and down
based on others performances but he&rsquo;s
also responsible for his own and we
expect
there&rsquo;s that word expectations our
internal expectations are realistic
they&rsquo;re
um
attainable
their
team orientated but also individual
driven and our expectations for cues
have taken the next step physically on
the ice stain the models a little bit
more I haven&rsquo;t seen the blocked off
pucks very much this year which is
already a good sign
the ability to make plays a little bit
quicker more production offensively he&rsquo;s
got great instincts and stuff can you
get more out of that is he responsible
defensively does this
Face-Off numbers go way up and we&rsquo;ve
seen that already in the exhibition
season so
he&rsquo;s already taking steps to more ice
time
but the way the game rolls out and what
the others are doing also affects how
you use people what&rsquo;s the likelihood of
uh being able to get Jersey and
sometimes later uh we&rsquo;re hoping to do
that and potentially already depending
on how
you know RV would likely be that last
game if he&rsquo;s going to play it all durers
we really believe we can get him in a
game or two even this week
with Thursday and a lot coming back
because I make it more difficult to get
some of your Brent carp has had a good
amount of campaign in the lineup and how
do you kind of deal with that situation
difficult decisions are good ones for us
and yeah getting Jersey back and watch
back is is great for our team the fact
that the the kid is really pushing and
doing some good things is another bonus
for all of us
um it&rsquo;ll be they&rsquo;ll sort themselves out
as time goes on
um
everybody&rsquo;s at a different
juncture in their careers uh Alexander
is not going to play in Ontario who&rsquo;s
going to play on our team uh Brian Clark
has two options he can play here go back
to Junior there&rsquo;s some that are waiver
bowl that buy us time there&rsquo;s other guys
we have to think about for waivers
there&rsquo;s so many factors that come in and
what we look like on day one on the blue
line
might not be what we look like on day
two it can vary from day to day and not
even based on injury just performance
and
business</p></blockquote></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/2022-2023-Pre-Season/ data-ctx="Todd McLellan talks to the media ahead of a preseason matchup vs the Anaheim Ducks" data-src=/2022-2023-Pre-Season class=internal-link>2022-2023 Pre-Season</a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://lakings-graph.com/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by John White using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, Â© 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://lakings-graph.com/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/vJourneyman>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/vJourneyman>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
