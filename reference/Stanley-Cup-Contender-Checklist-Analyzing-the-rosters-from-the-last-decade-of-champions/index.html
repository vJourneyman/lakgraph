<a href=https://theathletic.com/2077279/2020/09/21/cup-checklist-analyzing-the-rosters-from-the-last-decade-of-champions/ rel=noopener>Original Link</a></p><hr><p>There’s no exact formula for winning the Stanley Cup. The
<a href=https://theathletic.com/team/lightning/ rel=noopener>Lightning</a> have been a popular pick to win it all for years, but it took them five years since their last Stanley Cup Final berth to make it back. Few would have picked the
<a href=https://theathletic.com/team/stars/ rel=noopener>Stars</a> this season, especially with their starting goaltender injured, but they found a way and now they’re three wins away from being champions.</p><p>Building a roster to win it all isn’t easy, and even building a good team often isn’t enough in a sport with as much chaotic energy as hockey. But there are lessons to be learned from past winners; guidelines for how a team’s roster should be made up. Stylistically they all differ, but from a total value perspective, there are similar elements that can be looked upon as goals for roster-building. The last two Cup winners were led by an elite centre worth roughly three wins, but there’s a big difference between the way Ryan O’Reilly and
<a href=https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/capitals/nicklas-backstrom/ rel=noopener>Nicklas Backstrom</a> play, for example.</p><p>An elite top line centre being a prerequisite to winning the Stanley Cup shouldn’t come as a huge surprise; it’s a talking point that’s been championed for a long time. Over the past decade only one team, the 2011
<a href=https://theathletic.com/team/bruins/ rel=noopener>Bruins</a>, won the Stanley Cup without a projected top line centre.
<a href=https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/bruins/david-krejci/ rel=noopener>David Krejci</a> was just on the cusp and
<a href=https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/bruins/patrice-bergeron/ rel=noopener>Patrice Bergeron</a> hadn’t hit his full stride yet as one of the game’s best two-way players. However, both played at that level come playoff time. </p><p>On average, the top centre on a Stanley Cup winning team is worth around 3.8 wins in the regular season; that’s by far the most important piece for a contender. But there’s more to the puzzle than just one player.</p><p>This isn’t a new study by any means, it’s one I did for
<a href=https://www.si.com/hockey/news/eight-simple-rules-for-building-a-stanley-cup-contender rel=noopener>The Hockey News</a> four years ago and one that Cam Lawrence – who works for the
<a href=https://theathletic.com/team/fla-panthers/ rel=noopener>Florida Panthers</a> –
<a href=https://canucksarmy.com/2015/08/21/building-a-contender-part-5-conclusion/ rel=noopener>also did</a>, but it’s worth diving into it again with more data. This time around, I’m armed with projected values for each player at the time of the playoffs to better assess their true talent level, plus a couple extra seasons of results. I’ll also be looking at each position on the depth chart, not just the core players, to give a better idea of where certain players should fit on a Cup-contending roster.</p><p>It’s not just the average that matters, though. It would be foolish to treat 3.8 wins for a top line centre as a “you must be this tall to ride” measuring stick – it’s a range. No team is ever average or above relative to a Cup winner at every position on the roster and having a range of acceptable values helps illustrate where a player falls and how far off a team is. It’s even OK to be below average in a few areas. The key is to make up ground elsewhere and build a roster with as few concessions as possible.</p><p>It should be noted as well that rather than averaging out by left and right wingers or defencemen, the best wingers or defencemen on a given line or pair were grouped together. While most Cup winners are predominantly stronger on the right side, that distinction probably doesn’t matter and this properly groups
<a href=https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/capitals/alex-ovechkin/ rel=noopener>Alex Ovechkin</a> with
<a href=https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/blackhawks/patrick-kane/ rel=noopener>Patrick Kane</a> and
<a href=https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/capitals/john-carlson/ rel=noopener>John Carlson</a> with
<a href=https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/oilers/duncan-keith/ rel=noopener>Duncan Keith</a>, rather than with
<a href=https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/blues/brandon-saad/ rel=noopener>Brandon Saad</a> and
<a href=https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/capitals/michal-kempny/ rel=noopener>Michal Kempny</a>, respectively. </p><p>Here’s how the roster for a Stanley Cup winner looks, with an acceptable range of one standard deviation on either side.</p><p><a href=https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2020/09/18144149/Screen-Shot-2020-09-18-at-2.42.23-PM.png rel=noopener><img src=https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2020/09/18144149/Screen-Shot-2020-09-18-at-2.42.23-PM.png width=auto alt></a></p><p>Based on the above chart, a team that fancies itself a contender is looking at the following checklist in terms of top of the lineup players.</p><ul><li>Elite first-line centre that’s among the very best players in the world.</li><li>Elite first-line winger to support the elite centre.</li><li>Two other top-line wingers on each of the top two lines.</li><li>Top-line centre to play behind the elite centre. </li><li>Two more top-six forwards for depth in the middle six.</li><li>Elite No. 1 defenceman.</li><li>A second No. 1 defenceman to play behind him. </li><li>A top pairing defenceman to help anchor a strong second pair with the No. 2. </li><li>Another top-pairing calibre defender to crush soft minutes on the third pair. </li><li>A top 10 calibre starting goaltender.</li></ul><p>And that’s without mentioning two capable third-liners, another steady top four defenceman who can play on the top pair, and making sure no one on the fourth line or bottom pair is replacement level. It’s a tall order, especially making sure all the pieces fit together beyond numbers on a page. Chemistry matters.</p><p>So while that’s a handy checklist under ideal circumstances, there’s no hard-and-fast rule. That’s where the ranges come in. A team can get away with not meeting the criteria in one area if they surpass it elsewhere and certain areas are more negotiable than others. Only the elite center (9/10), elite defenceman (officially 8/10, but one of the misses is because Keith had an off year), and top pairing defenceman on the second pair (9/10) were found on 80 percent of the champions. Every other archetype on the checklist was there six out of 10 times.</p><p>A top 10 goalie would be great, but as long as he’s an above average starter it’s probably fine, especially with a strong defence in front of him. Having an elite winger on the top line is ideal, but a team can probably get away with someone that’s a shade below if they have strong depth in the middle six. </p><p>There’s other lessons that can be gleaned from this too, and those are the areas that are probably <em>not</em> worth sweating over. Three areas come to mind: third-line center, top pair next to the star and the fourth line.</p><p>Depth down the middle is crucial to building a Cup contender, but on average 86 percent of the value is confined to the top two centres. The past 10 Cup winners have been built off strong duos (O’Reilly/Schenn, Backstrom/Kuznetsov, Crosby/Malkin, Kopitar/Carter, Krejci/Bergeron). Meanwhile, only
<a href=https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/blues/tyler-bozak/ rel=noopener>Tyler Bozak</a>,
<a href=https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/sharks/nick-bonino/ rel=noopener>Nick Bonino</a> and
<a href=https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/capitals/mike-richards/ rel=noopener>Mike Richards</a> were considered to be centres above third-line calibre. The same goes for the wingers. Only 14 out of 30 third-liners were top six calibre.</p><p>There’s also the idea that a team’s cornerstone defenceman needs to play with another top pairing guy to maximize the top pair. But the beauty of most elite defencemen is they generally don’t need much help. We’re seeing that play out this year with
<a href=https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/lightning/victor-hedman/ rel=noopener>Victor Hedman</a> lugging around
<a href=https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/lightning/zach-bogosian/ rel=noopener>Zach Bogosian</a> or
<a href=https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/canucks/luke-schenn/ rel=noopener>Luke Schenn</a>, but there’s some historical precedent to it. Sure there’s Keith with
<a href=https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/lightning/brent-seabrook/ rel=noopener>Brent Seabrook</a>, but there’s also been
<a href=https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/islanders/zdeno-chara/ rel=noopener>Zdeno Chara</a> with
<a href=https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/islanders/dennis-seidenberg/ rel=noopener>Dennis Seidenberg</a>,
<a href=https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/kings/drew-doughty/ rel=noopener>Drew Doughty</a> with
<a href=https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/fla-panthers/willie-mitchell/ rel=noopener>Willie Mitchell</a>, John Carlson with Michal Kempny and
<a href=https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/golden-knights/alex-pietrangelo/ rel=noopener>Alex Pietrangelo</a> with
<a href=https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/canadiens/joel-edmundson/ rel=noopener>Joel Edmundson</a>. Good, steady players that coaches can trust in tough minutes – but they’re players that really aren’t that difficult to find.</p><p>Lastly, the average fourth line for a Cup contender looks like … an average fourth line. There’s nothing special here aside from a few years of
<a href=https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/penguins/matt-cullen/ rel=noopener>Matt Cullen</a> being awesome. If there’s a place to cut corners on a roster it’s here, especially since teams can ramp up the ice time of the top six in the playoffs.</p><p>But there’s an even more important reason the fourth lines don’t matter nearly as much here, and it’s because of the other part of this average Cup contender equation: how the players actually perform in the playoffs. That detail is often underreported on the analytics side when it comes to investigating a player’s total value, but it’s an important one – especially in comparison to how those players are projected to perform.</p><p>When the average first-line Cup-winning centre is projected to be worth 3.8 wins, that’s under the expectation of playing against an average team under average circumstances. But the playoffs are not that. They’re a gruelling grind against increasingly difficult competition where matchups become even more important in a seven-game series.</p><p>So top line centres on Cup winners don’t provide as much value as projected. In fact, they have the largest drop-off of any position on the depth chart, losing 0.9 wins of value. That’s a matter of goals being a lot harder to come by in the postseason and facing the toughest matchups night after night. </p><p>The lessened offence means most of the forwards lose value on average (about 0.3 wins worth) with none being hit harder than the fourth line. The trio already carries little value to begin with, and loses another 1.8 on top of that, meaning in the playoffs they provide sub-replacement level value on average. Again, it’s the matchups taking over as there are fewer places to hide a fourth line. With the top line and fourth line losing lots of value, the middle six on a Cup-winning team generally does pick up the slack; that’s possibly where the idea that a strong third-line centre is crucial to a championship-calibre team comes in. They get the second largest bump among forwards, suggesting it’s not that a team necessarily needs a strong third-line centre, but they do need one that can elevate his game in the playoffs. Though the Bruins didn’t win last year,
<a href=https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/bruins/charlie-coyle/ rel=noopener>Charlie Coyle</a>’s playoff excellence definitely comes to mind.</p><p>As for the defence, they’re dead even with projections on aggregate, but the value distribution changes dramatically. Most third pairs are a little better, while those usually strong second pairs really struggle relative to expectations on Cup-winning teams. Perhaps that’s due to them being used more often as shutdown pairs, but it’s certainly an interesting trend. </p><p>The top pair is where the biggest positive change comes from among a champion’s skaters. If you’re wondering why talking heads always wax poetic about the importance of having an elite No. 1 defender, it’s because of how they’ve generally elevated their game in the playoffs, becoming the most important skaters on the team when it matters most. On average, a team’s best defenceman has been 0.8 wins better in the playoffs, bringing their total value up to 3.3 wins on average (while top line centres drop to 2.9 wins). Pietrangelo, Carlson, Letang, Keith, Doughty, Chara all brought the heat in their Cup-winning seasons and unsurprisingly it’s Hedman and

Those types of defenders are the key to a lengthy playoff run.</p><p>But the most important player of all when it comes to the playoffs is, of course, the goalie, projected to be worth three wins, but earning closer to five on an average Cup winner.</p><p><a href=https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2020/09/18152436/Screen-Shot-2020-09-18-at-3.23.50-PM.png rel=noopener><img src=https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2020/09/18152436/Screen-Shot-2020-09-18-at-3.23.50-PM.png width=auto alt></a></p><p>On average, goalies on Cup-winning teams are <em>two</em> <em>wins</em> <em>better</em> than projected.
