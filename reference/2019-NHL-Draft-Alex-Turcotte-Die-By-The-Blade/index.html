<a href=https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/teams/buffalo-sabres rel=noopener><strong>Buffalo Sabres</strong></a> fanbase received a bit of disappointment at the
<a href=http://www.sbnation.com/nhl-draft rel=noopener><strong>NHL Draft</strong></a> Lottery, as they fell from #5 overall to #7. But do not despair. The good news is that regardless of selection #5 or #7, they will add an excellent, high-end prospect to a fairly deep pool of young players.</p><p>The question is, who is that prospect?</p><p>There is a pile of players in the #3-#12 range that Jason Botterill could believably target given the Sabres need for more talent is pretty broad. All sorts of skill sets, from big playmaking centermen to small, quick goal scoring wings can be had at that #7 spot. I’ll take this opportunity to profile one here.</p><p><strong>ALEX TURCOTTE, C, US DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM</strong></p><p>Another guy (see Zegras, Trevor or Boldy, Matthew) from the US Development Program who has lived in the shadow of Jack Hughes for the past two years, the 6’0 185# Turcotte spent much of last year laboring behind Hughes. He eventually took over as the U-17 top centerman and showed well once Hughes was called up to the U-18 NTDP team full-time. After his strong performance leading the U-17 team, and performing well in limited time with the U-18 team, the left-shot Turcotte came into his draft season as a guy who was thought to be a serious challenger for #2 overall. That talk got derailed early, as he went down with a nagging hip/back injury and missed the first dozen or so games for the NTDP. His return was anything but triumphant, as he immediately went down with another injury – a shoulder, presumably – in his first game back. So he missed basically the first two months before coming back right before Christmastime, an absence that saw him drop in my rankings. But once he did come back, the NTDP really threw him in the deep end, as Hughes was up with the USA World Juniors team at the time. And the Illinois native didn’t disappoint.</p><p>He finished with an eye-popping 62P in 37 games, including 27 goals. That’s actually slightly better than Hughes as far as PPG (2.17 to 2.0) which isn’t too shabby when you’re playing second fiddle to the top prospect in the Draft. Leading up to the U-18 Championships, where most scouts were waiting to see what Turcotte could do, he managed to get sick and was iffy to play right up until game-time. All he did there was put up 9P in 7 games! So he’s not only extremely skilled, but he’s a gamer! You can watch some of that action
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9N_eVbwfJY" rel=noopener>HERE</a> (I apologize for the music). See what a little Thera-Flu can do?</p><p>So what does this kid bring to the table? Turcotte’s game is one of speed, power, and aggression. Has a powerful stride that recalls some of Eichel’s jaunts through the Neutral Zone. A single stride just propels him down the ice. He’s better playing a linear game where he takes a lot of straight lines than someone like a Zegras or Hughes, who have superior edges and lateral movement and lean on that to take advantage of defenders. Turcotte would rather go through you than around you. He’s got remarkable timing – he can find seams at top speed and make a good judgment about exploiting them, with or without the puck. What’s special about him is his tempo. Turcotte always plays with pace, whether offensively or defensively. His skating might not be as graceful or as dazzling as a Hughes or Zegras, but it’s the explosion and the strength of his lower body that gets him where he needs to be ahead of everyone else.</p><p>Blessed with exceptional mitts, Turcotte can take bouncing pucks and turn them into pretty saucer passes or pick pucks out of the air on the fly and beat guys wide to attack the net. And attack the net he does. Not afraid of physical play, he seems to relish it, and will fearlessly power through checks or sticks to get to his spot around the cage. Around the net is where he does a lot of his damage, both in terms of scoring goals or setting them up. His play style makes it really tough to take the puck away, either in open ice or along the wall, as he uses that strong lower body much like Crosby to protect the puck from defenders and maintain his balance even against much bigger players. And in open ice, look out. He&rsquo;s got the burst and the superior stick handling to make a defender look silly. Intense competitor who’s motor never slows down, he understands how to manipulate a defense to get open looks while at the same time always being cognizant of his defensive responsibilities and rarely leaves open ice where the other team can get a good chance. Defensively, more than willing. Turcotte has a great feel for defending off the puck, and he’s so confident in his on-puck skills that he will happily pressure a puck carrier without any concern about losing his man or getting beat. Which rarely happens. Very good in the dot as well, I think somewhere in the 58% range.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvR0e2wpj3c" rel=noopener>HERE</a> are some more highlights from the NTDP games for your viewing pleasure.</p><p>Does this guy have a weakness? Not many. His shot is sub-par, honestly. It lacks velocity and accuracy, so he rarely uses it from distance, preferring to operate around the crease, which isn&rsquo;t that big of a drawback, as he&rsquo;s more of a pass-first guy than a shooter. Make no mistake, his speed, hands and smarts make him a very effective finisher in transition. A true puck hound, his speed and determination make him a nightmare on the forecheck but his frenetic style can lend itself to getting banged up, which may become an issue as he plays bigger opponents who can keep up with him skating-wise. In other words, he takes a lot of hits. As far as his competition, I think he’s benefited to some degree from playing behind Hughes, so he hasn’t faced as much of the best defenders night-in, night out. So I’m a little concerned about how high-end his offensive skill is: is he a Couturier/Kesler type of player, which is VERY good, or is there more? Can he carry a line and produce like a Bergeron/Couture? I’m inclined to think the former, but I would not at all be surprised by the latter. Either way, you&rsquo;re getting a heck of a player. If you’re looking for a comparable for Turcotte, one that always gets me is Dougie Gilmour. Not quite as aggressive as Killer (who is?), he&rsquo;s got the same combination of high-end speed, skill, two-way play, and desire in a similarly sized package.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://lakings-graph.com/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by John White using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2022</p><ul><li><a href=https://lakings-graph.com/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/vJourneyman>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/vJourneyman>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
