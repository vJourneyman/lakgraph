Fiala, 26, is coming off career-best totals in goals (33) and points (85), and his skills should mesh well with pass-first Kopitar.</p><p>Fiala also will get a lot of power-play time, which could pad his totals.

He must turn his occasional brilliance into consistent and responsible play as the third-line center behind Kopitar and

He filled in well while Viktor Arvidsson (20 goals in 66 games last season) recovered from back surgery. Arvidsson’s quicker-than-expected return puts Vilardi on the third line with Byfield and Alex Iafallo, a golden chance for all three to prove themselves.</p><p>Winger Arthur Kaliyev, 21, scored six of his 14 goals on the power play and can add punch to the second unit. Defenseman Tobias Bjornfot, 21, has struggled to keep a spot and that’s unlikely to change.</p><p>5</p><a href=#will-goaltending-be-a-problem><h3 id=will-goaltending-be-a-problem><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Will goaltending be a problem?</h3></a><p><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/86135f6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2790x1859+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F04%2Fe0%2F76a24fe04ea0bca0e316a0cab6d4%2Foilers-kings-hockey-60281.jpg" width=auto alt="Kings goaltender Jonathan Quick watches a shot fly past the goal during a playoff game against the Edmonton Oilers in May."></p><p>(Mark J. Terrill / Associated Press)</p><p>Coach Todd McLellan’s choice of Cal Petersen to start the opener last season seemed to signal an end to the Jonathan Quick-led Cup champions’ era and the rise of the next generation. That was the plan, but Petersen dropped the torch and Quick (.910 save percentage, 2.59 goals-against average) regained his old form.</p><p>Quick is as competitive as ever, but he’s approaching 37 and the Kings need to find a reliable partner to share the load. Petersen will get every chance at the job but can’t blow it again.
