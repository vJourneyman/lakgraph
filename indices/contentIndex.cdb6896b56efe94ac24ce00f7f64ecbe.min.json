The LA Kings host the Vegas Golden Knights this evening to open up a short, two-game homestand to begin the season.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n- Projected third line: [[Alex Iafallo]] – [[Quinton Byfield]] – [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- Projected fourth line: [[Carl Grundstrom]] – [[Blake Lizotte]] – [[Arthur Kaliyev]]\n- Projected starting goaltender: [[Jonathan Quick]]\n\n\u003e I think when those don’t exist, you should probably worry a little bit. The palms get sweaty, you get a little bit excited. The staff, and I don’t just mean the coaching staff, the whole organizatio, should have jitters, they should be excited. We’ve put a month’s worth of work into opening night and we want to perform well. It’s always an interesting night. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e I think you just get the excitement of the season starting. Sometimes you might feel a bit nervous, but I think that’s good. It means you’re focused, it means you’re ready, it means you’re excited. It’s all good stuff. -- [[Alex Edler]]\n\n\u003e There’s always excitement, a little bit nervous in a good way. With a new team, there’s even a little bit more excitement and I’m just ready to go. With how the summer’s been, now here we are for a new season. It goes fast and I can’t wait to get started in the new rink, with my new team. -- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n\u003e Puck protection is probably number one, the ability to protect in tight, tight areas, he’s got really good hockey vision there and IQ, making plays. He battles to protect pucks and he gives us an element that I’m not sure we have a whole bunch in this organization. He’s a natural scorer, a lot of high-end offense and he’s very creative in the types of plays he wants to make. -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\u003e It’s coming together. Having a couple of weeks now and few games under our belt, that always helps and I think it’s coming along nicely. Are we fully there yet, probably not, but we’re still learning about each other on the go and just trying to create and go from there. -- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\n\u003e I felt on the ice that we took a step closer to where we want to be from Game 1 to the last game on Saturday. It was nice. For me to get comortable with the systems, knowing what to do and with those two guys, learning how they play and just reading the game. I felt very confident on Saturday so I’m hoping for that tonight as well. -- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n### [[Rob Blake]]\n\u003e I think the way you look at it, if you’re in our 12 \\[forwards] or our starting six we would project upstairs, regardless of your situation in the CBA we’re making spot. Now, you have the ability to carry three extra players, whether it’s two forwards or two D, then we have to look a little bit at waivers and understand that we want to protect some of the assets and the players. There’s a few players that didn’t need waivers to go down but we also felt that they can still build their games \\[in the AHL]. Knock on wood, today is as healthy as we’ve been in a full year, on Sunday I think we saw every player back. We know we’re going to deal with injuries and we’re going to need some added depth down there that can come in and play.\n\n\u003e We go over that constantly. If we’re in a healthy situation, we had players that had to be exposed to waivers and you go over when to put them on and when not to. You put them on early, but then a team could claim them and look at them, you put them on later, it allows teams that have had injuries \\[a chance]. Most of our situations, we wanted to get through our camp, make sure we were healthy coming into Sunday, then we’d sit down, discuss the lineup and then players that were waiver eligible and those that weren’t and go forward from there. Losing players on waivers, it’s part of the process, I think we have to understand that. When you start getting better and you have more quality players, you’ll be in those situations.\n\n\u003e It was \\[a tough conversation] with those players. I still think those players can learn in the American League. Eventually, if a player is good enough, he’s an everyday NHL player, there will come a point where he’s not going to learn more in the American League, but I still think we can get some things accomplished with these players and that was our message. You did a terrific job, you’ve done everything we’ve asked you to do so far, we still think you can get better and we’re going to need you down the stretch.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.66014768Z","tags":null},"/10-13-Preview-Clarke-Debut-Expected-+-Arvidsson-out-19-55-13-Line-Being-First-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"10-13 Preview - Clarke Debut Expected + Arvidsson out, 19-55-13 Line, Being First - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# 10-13 Preview - Clarke Debut Expected + Arvidsson out, 19-55-13 Line, Being First - LA Kings Insider\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-13 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [10-13 Preview - Clarke Debut Expected + Arvidsson out, 19-55-13 Line, Being First - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/13/10-13-preview-clarke-debut-expected-arvidsson-out-19-55-13-line-being-first/)\n2022-10-13 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[10-13 Preview - Clarke Debut Expected + Arvidsson out, 19-55-13 Line, Being First - LA Kings Insider]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n- [[Jonathan Quick]]\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n- [[Brendan Lemieux]]\n- [[Carl Grundstrom]]\n- [[Alex Iafallo]]\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings conclude a short, two-game homestand tonight, with the Seattle Kraken in town for the first time this season.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e This is the moment I’ve dreamed of for so long. I’ve been watching the NHL for my entire life and now that I’m officially going to be in it, it’s kind of crazy to think about. This is going to be something I’ll never forget, it’ll be pretty cool. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e It wasn’t planned that way, but I think there’s something that can help him in that situation. He’s been around for long enough now, throughout the exhibition season, to see how daily rhythm occurs, prepping for a game. It does change when it gets to the regular season a little bit, but the general prep is the same. The quality of the opponent is much higher and that will be the biggest change for him. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e [[Trent Yawney|Yawns]] and I were just talking about it, there’s enough that’s going on in their world right now. First game, family in town, we don’t want to over burden him with details, we want him to play the game and we want him to enjoy the process. I think the less he has on his mind, the more instinctual hockey, the better chance he has for success. So, we haven’t sat with him and gone through everything, what to expect and what not to expect. If he comes to us, we can certainly help him, but we’ll leave him alone. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e I just want to play my game. Just like the rookie tournament, just like preseason, I just want to come in there and play. Yes, it’s going to be a big moment, yes it’s going to be really exciting, but I think after that first shift I’ll just settle in and do what I do, then I’m just playing hockey again, it’s just another game. There’ll be whirlwind of emotions right off the bat, but I think once I settle in, once the game just starts flowing, I’ll be just fine. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e [[Gabe Vilardi|Gabe]] is a big body and myself, so we’ve got to use that size, wear down their D, get on pucks a little bit quicker, and Al is so good with his stick and he uses his body well. I think we’re a line that can grind down teams and wear them down to get our opportunities like that. -- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\n\u003e Obviously we wanted to win the game, but looking at our line I feel like there was good support all around the rink for us. We talk during the practices we’ve had and during the game, just talking about where we’re going to be depending on the forecheck, where the pieces are in place, so I feel like it was good for us to get that game in. We’ll keep growing. -- [[Alex Iafallo]]\n\n\u003e He can be a little bit of the conscience on the line, he’s a veteran player, he’s a calm individual that doesn’t get overly frustrated. He can talk them through situations and he takes care of somebody’s defensive assignments so that \\[Byfield and Vilardi] can roll a little bit more. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e Once we get in the o-zone, [[Alex Iafallo|Al]] is a very hard-working guy, he’s a smart player, an underrated smart player and Q is so gifted with the puck. We’ve just got to get to the o-zone, we’re good when we get to the o-zone and we’ve got to do the things defensively to get there. -- [[Gabe Vilardi]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.66014768Z","tags":null},"/10-15-Postgame-For-a-lot-of-years-in-the-league-this-ones-tough-to-explain":{"title":"10-15 Postgame - “For a lot of years in the league, this ones tough to explain”","content":"\n# 10-15 Postgame - “For a lot of years in the league, this ones tough to explain”\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-15 | [[The Forum Report]] | [10-15 Postgame - “For a lot of years in the league, this ones tough to explain”](https://theforumreport.com/10-15-postgame-for-a-lot-of-years-in-the-league-this-ones-tough-to-explain/) |\n| 2022-10-15 | [[The Forum Report]] | [[10-15 Postgame - “For a lot of years in the league, this ones tough to explain”]]                                                                                                       |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jon Rosen]]\n\n\n## Players\n- \n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e In a polar contrast to their traditionally structured and defense-focused games a half-generation earlier, the LA Kings and Minnesota Wild erupted for a Smythe Division-level of offensive entertainment as the Kings ably responded to every Wild challenge in a building often unforgiving to teams trying to iron out their games.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e Fuckin’ hope we never have to win like that again, but give the guys a lot of credit. They battled back every time \\[Minnesota] put us on our heels and it’s not very often the last couple years that we’ve been able to trade goals when we’ve needed them, and this was a night we needed to find some goals, and we found them. A lot of credit goes to the guys. That’s obviously not the way I think we want to be winning these games, but hey … sometimes throughout the season some games are going to call for that. -- [[Cal Petersen]]\n\n\u003e I had to decide there, when they tied it up, I was like, ‘we can’t give up another goal,’ and once we scored, I decided that was it. But we got some huge, huge blocks from [[Phillip Danault|Phil]], from [[Mikey Anderson|Mikey]] down the stretch, so I had some other goalies back there with me. -- [[Cal Petersen]]\n\n\u003e Today I felt pretty good from the start, and obviously a little more motivated playing against my old team. -- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n\n## [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e You can see little snippets of things that are starting to happen, and that’s a positive sign.\n\n\n\u003e I thought that [[Gabe Vilardi|Gabe]] and [[Quinton Byfield]], other than maybe the penalty he didn’t need to take at the end, they were very capable of playing in those situations. … [[Trent Yawney]] has a tremendous amount of confidence in all six guys and he’s willing to put them out there. That’s how you grow as a team and how you grow as individuals. But we’re playing to win, and if we have to cut it back, we will. \n\n\u003e For me, goaltending’s a lot ilke pitching. It’s tough to find your Cy Young Winner in April. You usually find them in September and October, and goaltending around the league is probably like that – it’s finding its way. We have to help our goaltenders as much as we can. We haven’t been as tight as we’ve been, we haven’t broken out as clean, and the \\[penalty parade] puts a lot of pressure on them.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.66014768Z","tags":null},"/10-15-Preview-Potential-Lineup-+-Fialas-Return-Minnesota-Natives-Seeking-Identity-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"10-15 Preview - Potential Lineup + Fialas Return, Minnesota Natives, Seeking Identity - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# 10-15 Preview - Potential Lineup + Fialas Return, Minnesota Natives, Seeking Identity - LA Kings Insider\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-15 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [10-15 Preview - Potential Lineup + Fialas Return, Minnesota Natives, Seeking Identity - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/15/10-15-preview-potential-lineup-fialas-return-minnesota-natives-seeking-identity/)\n2022-10-15 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[10-15 Preview - Potential Lineup + Fialas Return, Minnesota Natives, Seeking Identity - LA Kings Insider]]\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n- [[Sean Durzi]]\n- [[Cal Petersen]]\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Mikey Anderson]]\n- [[Blake Lizotte]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings are on the road for the first time this season, as they begin a five-game trip this evening versus the Minnesota Wild.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e It’s interesting how quick bumps and bruises occur. You don’t quite see them during exhibition season, you do a little bit, but when the real season starts, that’s another thing we’re starting to figure out, it’s hard and it’s good for us to have a few of those right now. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e It’s a little weird, but in a good way. I’m happy to be back and excited for the game tonight, to play against my old teammates, see them again and to be back in the old arena, with the fans. I really enjoyed my time here, it’s exciting to be back. -- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n\u003e I don’t think we’ve played great in these two games, we played better in the preseason, I think, but that’s how it goes, it’s up and down. The chemistry will come, we’re three good players and I can see our line being very effective. I think tonight will be a good night. -- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n\u003e For Kevin coming back, this is the first time and it happens real early in the season. For as much as we’d like to make it about Kevin and play really well, we’re not in that luxurious position right now of everything going the way we want it to, so we’ll focus on the team. There are different ways you can acknowledge his return in the locker room, whether it’s the starting lineup or something like that, but it is more about the Kings than it is Kevin tonight. I wish it was the other way, but it just isn’t. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e In the first COVID year, like 40 people were able to come to the game and someone on the Minnesota side got my mom and dad tickets, but other than that, this will be the first one. It’s fun to be back, everything I do is around this part of town, so it’s fun to be back and see everything, see mom, dad and everyone. -- [[Mikey Anderson]]\n\n\u003e It’ll be fun, I’ve been to enough games growing up here where it’ finally fun to have family, friends and everyone in the crowd but at the same time, it’s a big, important game for us, especially with how we’ve started, so we’re trying to get back on track. -- [[Mikey Anderson]]\n\n\u003e We’ve got to decide who we want to be and how we want to play. When you have some success, or a margin of success the year prior, coming back is a hard thing. You tend to wander away from what your identity is, especially when you’ve added talent, and you forget how hard it was. Right now we’re in that funk, where we’ve got to figure out who we want to be and how we’re going to do it. Tonight’s opponent will be a real good challenge for us, because if we keep choosing the route we’re choosing, I don’t think we’re going to have success for a little while, but eventually we’ll get there. -- [[Todd McLellan]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.66014768Z","tags":null},"/10-17-Preview-Full-Morning-Skate-Today-+-McLellan-on-Offense-Defense-Zone-Entries-and-detROYt-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"10-17 Preview - Full Morning Skate Today + McLellan on Offense-Defense, Zone Entries and detROYt - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# 10-17 Preview - Full Morning Skate Today + McLellan on Offense-Defense, Zone Entries and detROYt - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-17 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [10-17 Preview - Full Morning Skate Today + McLellan on Offense-Defense, Zone Entries and detROYt - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/17/10-17-preview-full-morning-skate-today-mclellan-on-offense-defense-zone-entries-detroyt/) |\n| 2022-10-17 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[10-17 Preview - Full Morning Skate Today + McLellan on Offense-Defense, Zone Entries and detROYt - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                                                               |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The first road trip of the season continues, as the Kings visit Detroit to take on the Red Wings in game two of five in total.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Matt Roy]]\n- [[Alex Iafallo]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n- One Side Up, One Side Down\n- Offensive \n- Defensive\n- Rush Hour 2\n- detROYt\n\n\u003e I think you saw some of it last year. It’s just hard to put all the years together because they were they’ve been estranged themselves with COVID, but our entry stats from an analytical standpoint have improved. They can still get better, but they’ve improved and we want to continue to grow that. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e Getting those rush chances and driving the net is going to help us win games. Scoring off the rush is going to be huge, getting shots off of those, not missing any passes and staying consistent there and we’ll be fine. -- [[Alex Iafallo]]\n\n\u003e We’ve got a lot of fast guys on this team, we play the 1-3-1 and create turnovers in the neutral zone and go from the other way, right away,” Vilardi added. “That’s something for sure.

If he doesn’t finish the night, something went wrong somewhere, but the plan is that. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e A common theme around the league is you dress a few more veterans at home, you don’t have to travel them to wherever you’re going. They play big, big minutes during the year, so alleviating travel, I think you’re seeing that. The tendency is that the home team at points has a stronger lineup, or a more veteran-type lineup, because that’s where you want to play those individuals, while the road team tends to be a little younger, or guys that won’t play as much during the year. I think that’s a tendency around the league and that’s what we’re seeing again this year. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e We’ve got four left and we play every second night, we’re still trying to evaluate some of the question marks and they need to continue to play, but we have to make sure now that the team is up and running. By the end of the training camp, the veterans should all have three or four games for sure. Maybe not quite today, but moving forward, you’d like to see all your units together at one point, pairs playing with each other on the penalty kill, I think that’s important. We still have a day or two here to evaluate and try to give opportunity to someone. Every player has a lifeline and some players have extended there’s, others, it’s shrunk on them. This is the week. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n### [[Sean Walker]]\n\u003e Very excited, it’ll probably be a lot of nerves for the first game back, even though it’s exhibition, but it’ll be exciting and nervewracking. I’m just trying to go out and play my game.\n\n\u003e I think it’ll just be kind of the first of everything, the first three on two, the first battle along the boards, the first o-zone shift, the first shot on net. I think it’ll be a lot of things, just checking all the boxes and making sure that everything feels good. So I’m definitely excited, just want to go out there, not think about it too much and just play.\n\n\u003e Yeah, we have a great group of guys and I think everybody kind of knew where I was coming from. There were definitely some plays that were hard and guys gave me some good bumps, but you know nothing ever really recreates when you’re playing against another team. It’ll be a good test and I’m excited for it.\n\n\u003e Yeah, get that contact, I think that’s been a big thing. You know, I’ve done all the checklists and the skating, the positioning, whatever that is, but the body contact was probably the main thing. It’ll be a good test and like I said, I’m excited for it.\n\n\u003e The biggest challenge was just not playing. A lot of people talk about the mental side of it, the physical side of it and luckily, I didn’t have too much of a struggle with it. I was able to come here and do my rehab every day, be with the guys every day and the team was great helping me out with anything I needed, getting me tickets to concerts, anything that could keep me busy. So, as much as it was trying year and it was awful because I wanted to be a part of it, I was able to do some things that you’re not able to do when you are playing a season. It was it was really difficult and everything but I made the most of it and I’m ready to be back.","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.66014768Z","tags":null},"/10-4-Preview-Projected-Lineup-+-Petersen-expected-Clarke-goes-5-for-5-Todays-Practice":{"title":"10-4 Preview – Projected Lineup + Petersen expected, Clarke goes 5-for-5, Today’s Practice","content":"\n# 10-4 Preview – Projected Lineup + Petersen expected, Clarke goes 5-for-5, Today’s Practice\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n 2022-10-04   | [[LA Kings Insider]]  | [10-4 Preview – Projected Lineup + Petersen expected, Clarke goes 5-for-5, Today’s Practice](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/04/10-4-preview-projected-lineup-petersen-expected-clarke-goes-5-for-5-todays-practice/)\n\n## Contributors:\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n## Players\n- [[Cal Petersen]]\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings and Ducks square off for the second time in three days, with the setting moving to Honda Center in Anaheim.\n\n## Notes\n\u003e If you see them in our group, they’re usually one-hundred percent, because there’s no way you can put a goalie in there and tell them to take it easy, waste of time. So there’s goaltender work that’s done outof sight sometimes, different sheet of ice, just rehab work. -- [[Todd McLellan]] on goalies returning from injury\n\n\u003e The goalies are a different breed, we all know that. They get a little bit of time with Billy and his goaltending staff, sometimes even away from the team. Just movement, tracking pucks depending on what the injury is, and then they come back into the group. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e He doesn’t lack confidence and he doesn’t portray arrogance. That’s a pretty good quality to have. -- [[Todd McLellan]] on [[Brandt Clarke]] heading into his fifth of five pre-season games\n\n\u003e That’s kind of what I was hoping for, I love playing games. The games are the best part of hockey so yeah, it’s been it’s been really good so far and I’m not looking for a break. I’m not tired, I’ve got that youth in me, so I still have a pretty good engine. I’m not banged up or anything, I’m ready to go every night and I’m pretty happy that they keep putting me in there. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e I think so, yeah, that’s what I’ve been doing and everyone just keeps encouraging me, they keep showing me stuff to do and helping me out but they’re still encouraging me to do my thing. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e He feels comfortable with his toolkit, he can use it anywhere he wants on the ice. It’s different and it’s going to get even more different as early as \\[tonight’s game] as more and more top-six players come into the lineup and rosters get stronger and stronger. He’s discovering his boundaries using his confidence, what can I get away with and what can’t I. So far so good. It will be probably a smaller toolbox as the league gets better, but give him credit for using the tools that he has. -- [[Todd McLellan]] on [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e I’m really confident in myself right now, things have been going pretty well for me and I’m really happy with how I’ve been playing but you have to bring your best each game. You may have played well last game, but you have to step it up even more this game. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.66014768Z","tags":null},"/10-6-Preview-Projected-Game-Group-+-Durzi-On-Return-Moverare-on-Opportunity-Utes":{"title":"10-6 Preview – Projected Game Group + Durzi On Return, Moverare on Opportunity, Utes","content":"\n# 10-6 Preview – Projected Game Group + Durzi On Return, Moverare on Opportunity, Utes\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n 2022-10-06   | [[LA Kings Insider]]  | [10-6 Preview – Projected Game Group + Durzi On Return, Moverare on Opportunity, Utes](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/06/10-6-preview-projected-game-group-durzi-on-return-moverare-on-opportunity-utes/)\n\n## Contributors:\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n## Players\n- [[Sean Durzi]]\n- [[Jacob Moverare]]\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings head into their penultimate game of the preseason with their annual trip to Salt Lake City to take on the Vegas Golden Knights.\n\n## Notes\n\n### [[Sean Durzi]] \n\n- Expected to play his first pre-season game, returning from off-season surgery. That surgery apparently was to fix an injury he managed for awhile.\n\n\u003e I think that he had an injury that was ongoing, it was there and it was just time to have it fixed so that it wouldn’t keep continue on. Did it affect this play a lot, I think he’s played a lot with it, maybe he got used to it, but it needed to be fixed. -- [[Todd McLellan]] on [[Sean Durzi]]\n\n\u003e I mean, it wasn’t great, but itt’s something where I knew I would miss some time and I was just waiting for the right time, even if there never really is a right time. I got it done and I’m looking forward to feeling even better. I guess I just got used to it and played through it. -- [[Sean Durzi]]\n\n\u003e Maybe just the speed of making reads defensively again, but obviously that comes with getting games in and that will come. The coaches are pushing me every day and making sure I’m doing things right and that I’m doing it to the best of my abilities and then pushing it to be even better than that. -- [[Sean Durzi]]\n\n\u003e Feeling good, ready to go. I’m excited finally and there’s not much more to do. Just go play. -- [[Sean Durzi]]\n\n\n### [[Jacob Moverare]]\n\u003e I see every day that I get to play here during preseason as an opportunity to show how I can play, play well and earn some trust with the team. -- [[Jacob Moverare]]\n\n\n\u003e I think it’s just about being steady, that’s my main thing that I need to really focus on. I have to prove that they can trust me to be a steady guy. In practice, every 2-on-1, every 3-on-2, I try to not get scored on and I want to hit every pass, focus on the small details. -- [[Jacob Moverare]]\n\n\u003e Both Edler and Royzie are two guys that I try to look at a little bit extra, because they’re both really steady guys. I try to watch them, see what they do and how they play. -- [[Jacob Moverare]]\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.66014768Z","tags":null},"/10-7-Practice-Arvidsson-approaches-game-action-+-final-tuneups-Tu-Liga-schedule":{"title":"10-7 Practice – Arvidsson approaches game action + final tuneups \u0026 Tu Liga schedule","content":"\n# 10-7 Practice – Arvidsson approaches game action + final tuneups \u0026 Tu Liga schedule\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n 2022-10-07   | [[LA Kings Insider]]  | [10-7 Practice – Arvidsson approaches game action + final tuneups \u0026 Tu Liga schedule](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/07/10-7-practice-arvidsson-approaches-game-action-final-tuneups-tu-liga-schedule/)\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n## Players\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Training camp practices are in the books!\n\u003e As Todd McLellan said last night and reinforced here this morning, the evaluation process has not ended, especially not with an exhibition contest still on the schedule for tomorrow.

From a business perspective, managing the cap, waivers and transactions that have to happen, these have to get planned out a little bit earlier than tomorrow, so there’s a plan. I know Rob and his staff have a plan in place and it can adjust after tomorrow, based on performance, injury, need, waiver wire from another team, whatever it might be, but there is a plan in place. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e We’ll have to evaluate him, like we do after every skate, but I think there’s a good chance he’ll be in tomorrow. If he’s fresh, capable and feeling good, we’re going to play him. -- [[Todd McLellan]] on [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n\n\u003e Yeah, we’ll see, I’m taking it day-by-day and just trying to work on my game, tying to be comfortable out there. It’s coming and we’ll see when I get the call. I’ll talk with the medical staff and see where we’re at. -- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n\n\u003e I think it’s timing, just being in the right positions.

They’re going to need some reminders, but we, like most teams, are going to be a work in progress for a good month to nail down exactly how you want to play. Special teams are still a big part of wins and losses. Game management is really hard to practice and that’s a big part of wins and losses, so they have to manage themselves in those situations. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e We’re not trying to shed a lot of habits, we’re actually trying to bring them back, which is kind of unique, that’s what we’re waiting for. I think we did some things better down the stretch last year than we’re doing right now and we’re trying to retrieve those habits and those situational things that we did better, but I’m sure most teams are probably saying that.

It’s my first game back, so I need to be prepared for that, no time to spare. Just leave it all out there and then hopefully I’ll be ready for the home opener. -- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\n\u003e I got some good rest, you know, I had been playing a lot of hockey so that was nice but you want to be playing hockey every day. That definitely sucked, but they let me ease my way back into it over the last two, three days so I think I’m back up to speed with my cardio and everything. I’m just trying to get back into it. -- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\n\u003e Our net play, quite frankly, hasn’t been good. We spent a large chunk of practice \\[yesterday] just working on that one specific area and would like to see it pay dividends as early as tomorrow. It’ll be a work in progress. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e \\[Yesterday] in practice, we focused on net play. We’ve been struggling a little bit throughout the preseason and that’s something you obviously don’t work during the summer because you’re not trying to hurt guys or anything like that. That’s something that you need to get back through preseason, because you can’t work on it, it’s probably the main things, defending for real and net play. -- [[Drew Doughty]]\n\n\u003e The practices at the start camp are a little slow, too many guys, not getting enough reps. Now that we’ve narrowed it down, we can work on individual things, like at the end of practice, we worked on 2-on-2s, 1-on-1s and stuff like that. If you do have to start a camp, there’s just too many guys and guys aren’t getting reps. So you have to wait until you pare it down. -- [[Drew Doughty]]\n\n\u003e That player has to be a trusting player. The 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th forward, the seventh or eighth D, you have to be a trusting individual because you might not go every night but when your number’s called, we have to be able to trust you to go in and do the job on both sides of the puck.    -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e We have \\[moved players around] throughout exhibition season, some of it by design, sometimes when it just happens. Guys on the left side, the right side, I think [[Jaret Anderson-Dolan|Anderson-Dolan]] has played just about everywhere. You’re trying to calculate where he fits best, or where whoever that group is fits best in case of injury, poor play and how you spot them in. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.66014768Z","tags":null},"/2022-2023-Pre-Season":{"title":"2022-2023 Pre-Season","content":"\n# 2022-2023 Pre-Season\n\n| Date | Site | Title | \n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n| 2022-10-10 | [[LA Kings on YouTube]] | [[Head Coach Todd McLellan speaks to the media after Mondays practice]]\n| 2022-10-10 | [[LA Kings on YouTube]] | [[GM Rob Blake speaks to the media before the 2022-23 Regular Season]]\n| 2022-10-10 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[On the eve of the 2022-23 season, Kings leadership expecting progress from increased expectations -

10 Biggest Questions For The 2022 LA Kings Offseason https://player.fm/1BQGQbk\n\n1. What will the other teams in the division do?\n\t1. Coaching\n\t2. Free agents\n\t3. Players asking to be traded\n\t4. Teams looking to move into the playoffs\n\t5. Vegas\n\t\t1. Fits almost all of those things\n\t\t2. Very little cap space\n\t6. Vancouver\n\t\t1. JT Miller\n\t\t2. Quinn Hughes\n\t\t3. Elias Petterson\n\t7. Anaheim\n\t\t1. Lots of cap space\n2. What happens at the draft?\n\t1. 19th overall in the first round\n\t2. Six picks, no seventh rounder\n\t3. Third rounder went to Nashville in the [Viktor Arvidsson trade](https://www.nhl.com/kings/news/la-kings-trade-draft-picks-for-viktor-arvidsson/c-325544088)\n\t4. Own Pens third rounder from [Jeff Carter trade](https://www.nhl.com/news/jeff-carter-traded-to-penguins-by-kings/c-323556688)\n\t5. Last year the Kings weren't quality over quantity, an artifact of the COVID year\n\t6. Blockbuster deals usually require trading a first rounder, but questioning the need for such\n\t7. 50 context limit and 90 player reserve list\n\t\t1. Didn't count players in junior\n\t\t2. If every RFA and UFA signed, 49 contracts \n3. Re-signing Adrian Kempe\n\t1. Arbitration eligible\n\t2. How many years of UFA are you buying?\n4. Re-signing Mikey Anderson\n\t1. Walker and Roy both signed second contracts for around $3M/year\n\t2. The Athletic said he's the 8th best shorten defensemen in the league\n5. Left defense\n\t1. Anderson/Bjornfot Young guys\n\t2. Edler/Maata veterans who might not have been anticipated to return, but now might\n\t3. Bjornfot is only 20/21, had great tools, already 100 NHL games played, fell out of the lineup. Great with Roy, not great with Durzi. Might need a steady defenseman. He had a better season then just how it ended.\n6. Right defense\n\t1. Drew doughty is a lock. Roy is probable.\n\t2. Walker off of injury\n\t3. Durzi and Spence showed they can play. \n\t4. Faber, Grans, Clarke\n\t5. Spence and Grans can play on Ontario\n\t6. Durzi is no longer eager exempt. Clarke can only play in junior or the NHL \n\t7. What does the organization think is most important? Continuity, development, experience? Defense, offense?\n\t8. Didn't even mention Strand, Stetcher, Moverare, Wolanin\n7. RFA forwards other than Kempe\n\t1. JAD, Grundstrom, Lemieux, Villardi, Lias Andersson \n\t2. Grundstrom has a playoff game and did well. Maybe the most improved. Consistent when I'm the lineup. Impactful bottom six. Dustin Brown light.\n\t3. JAD \u0026 Villardi: both probably qualified, figure out where they slot on training camp. \n\t4. LW1 and LW3 are up for grabs. And probably 4 total wing spots\n8. UFA veterans\n\t1.

Today’s contest is the first of seven total exhibition games, with three coming on the road, two at neutral sites and two at Crypto.com Arena.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Matt Roy]]\n\u003e Pace, physicality, positioning, I mean, sometimes in games, you just trust the guy to be on the right position, but in summer it’s as a kind of looping all over the place. There’s more structure now and in that sense, it makes the game a little bit easier, but at the same time, the pace, is the physicality of the stakes.\n\n\u003e Yeah, I think naturally, the guy like Brownie leaving kind of leaves a hole on the team and it doesn’t have to be one person stepping up. I think, us as a group, everyone can step up and contribute in different ways and fill the void that way.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]] on [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\u003e Everything about him so far has been real positive. The game that got Brandt here is the game that we’re seeing right now. He’s a cerebral player, he sees things, he anticipates well, he’s a great passer, he does play with some risk in his game, which isn’t a bad thing, and he’s very competitive.\n\n\u003e He’s going to learn a lot of the tricks of the trade, but he’s also going to teach some of those too because he has some things in him that some others don’t. His strength, fitness and conditioning are at a very elite level for junior and it has to get better for the pro level but that’s called being an underage player.\n\n### [[Akil Thomas]]\n\u003e These scrimmages are game-like, but they’re not a full game in a full barn and stuff like that. If I’m playing, I’m excited to get back into action and show what I can do.\n\n\u003e The biggest thing for me is that I feel prepared. That just gives me a little bit more confidence and that’s probably something I didn’t have last year because I wasn’t prepared, I didn’t skate once. It was tough coming back off of injury and especially coming back and then injuring my foot. It definitely took a while to get my legs back, but I feel really confident and I’m getting some good habits early on and trying to build off it.\n\n\u003e I don’t have a stern approach because in the past, maybe I’d be thinking I’ve got to do this or that and be a little bit nervous. For me it’s just about showing up to the game. I’ve done my work in the offseason to be prepared so I’m just going to pay attention to the video beforehand and make sure I’m playing well defensively and the rest will kind of happen.","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.66014768Z","tags":null},"/9-26-Preview-Projected-Lineup-+-Back-To-Back-Thoughts-JADs-Focus-Spence-Moverare-debuts":{"title":"9-26 Preview – Projected Lineup + Back-To-Back Thoughts, JADs Focus, Spence, Moverare debuts","content":"\n# 9-26 Preview – Projected Lineup + Back-To-Back Thoughts, JADs Focus, Spence, Moverare debuts\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-09-26 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [9-26 Preview – Projected Lineup + Back-To-Back Thoughts, JADs Focus, Spence, Moverare debuts](http://lakingsinsider.com/2022/09/26/9-26-preview-projected-lineup-back-to-back-thoughts-jads-focus-spence-moverare-debuts/)\n2022-09-26 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[9-26 Preview – Projected Lineup + Back-To-Back Thoughts, JADs Focus, Spence, Moverare debuts]]\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Jaret Anderson-Dolan]]\n- [[Jordan Spence]]\n- [[Jacob Moverare]]\n- [[Angus Booth]]\n- [[Lias Andersson]]\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n- \n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings will complete a preseason-opening back-to-back set this evening as they visit the Vegas Golden Knights at T-Mobile Arena.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Lias Andersson]]\n\u003e  It was fun. It was a different game, a lot of penalties, so there was no rhythm in the first two periods. A little different, but I think we stood up pretty well In the first period, we struggled a bit with penalties and then we started moving our feet a little bit more and in the second and third, I think we should be pretty happy with it.\n\n\u003e It’s been five games here in five days \\[between camp scrimmages and exhibition games]. I’m just trying to do the best with it, do my stuff in the gym and make sure that I’m ready to play.\n\n\n\n### [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\u003e Yeah, it was definitely not a standard flow, back and forth kind of game. They had a lot of pressure in the first period because we were killing the whole time and we had a lot of pressure in the second period because we were on the man advantage. That definitely gave our special teams guys a lot of practice and our kill was amazing, we barely gave them any shots, but our power play was definitely generating get some good shots off but unfortunately we didn’t bury any of them. \n\n\u003e With those three inter-squad games, and now two games in a row, it’s definitely going to be tiring after tonight, but they just want to see my consistency, that’s why they’re throwing me in there. I’m going to rise to the occasion, I’m not going to sit back or anything, I’m still going to play my game. I feel fine and I’m going to be ready to go.\n\n### [[Jaret Anderson-Dolan]]\n\u003e Yeah, definitely. I think for everyone, no matter what spot you’re in, for the guys that have been here, it’s getting your timing back and getting your game legs back and getting ready for the regular season. For guys that are competing for jobs, it’s just an opportunity to prove yourself, so I’m definitely excited.\n\n\u003e Puck possession and protecting pockets was the big focus this summer. It’s something they talked about with me at my exit meeting and I think I’ve gotten a little bit better at it over the summer. Now, it’s just translating that into my game and these preseason games.\n\n### [[Jordan Spence]]\n\u003e I think it just comes with the experience from last season. Luckily for me, I played 24 games, so for me to have that experience, I just want to bring that into camp and showcase what I can bring. I think I’m more confident this year, and it’s my goal to make the team, so we’ll see how it goes.\n\n\u003e I only had one game \\[at the Rookie Faceoff], but to have that five on five game, that pace, it got me a little bit more prepared than maybe the other guys, because I’m just used to fast play. I think it was good for me to come into main camp and have all of that conditioning.\n\n\u003e No one’s perfect, everyone makes mistakes, but I think it’s just the guys who bounce back and become better with that. For me, I know what I have to do to become a better player, I know my weaknesses. I’m just trying to do the best I can to fix those \\[during camp] and go from there in the future.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.66014768Z","tags":null},"/9-28-Preview-Projected-Lineup-+-Reign-Returners-Defensive-Camp-Battle-Bjornfot-Quotes":{"title":"9-28 Preview – Projected Lineup + Reign Returners, Defensive Camp Battle, Bjornfot Quotes","content":"\n# 9-28 Preview – Projected Lineup + Reign Returners, Defensive Camp Battle, Bjornfot Quotes\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-09-28 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [9-28 Preview – Projected Lineup + Reign Returners, Defensive Camp Battle, Bjornfot Quotes](http://lakingsinsider.com/2022/09/28/9-28-preview-projected-lineup-reign-returners-defensive-camp-battle-bjornfot-quotes/)\n2022-09-28 | [[LA Kings Insider]] |  [[9-28 Preview – Projected Lineup + Reign Returners, Defensive Camp Battle, Bjornfot Quotes]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Tobias Bjornfot]]\n- [[Sean Durzi]]\n- [[Francesco Pinelli]]\n- [[Matt Roy]]\n- [[Sean Walker]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings and Sharks will square off for the second time in four days, as the two teams meet in Ontario for the inaugural Empire Classic.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Matt Roy]]\n\u003e Lots of good memories from Ontario, the community there was great and the fans were really passionate. My first year there, we made it to the playoffs so that was pretty fun playing there. I had great coaches and great teammates, which made it a lot of fun. It was a really great experience.\n\n\u003e When you’re playing in the AHL, you’re competing against your teammates \\[for callups] but you’re also competing with them. It’s cool that a lot of us have now come up together to the Kings.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e The one thing about Blakey is that he takes a lot of input in from the people that he has around him and I think that’s a real good quality. He has to make decisions based on roster spots, he has to make decisions based on salary cap, decisions based on performance, on waivers, on injuries, sometimes it’s combinations and pairs.\n\n\u003e That’s an option, we’re allowed to have 23 roster spots. We don’t know who will be healthy or who won’t be at that roster date. Any combination of 23 we can come up with is an option.\n\n\u003e I think when you get to the point where decisions are hard and there’s huge debate over them, that’s a good spot for an organization. It’s not just on the blue line, there are some forwards too, but when we’re doing that, we are potentially in a good spot. It’s up to us to produce at that point.\n\n### [[Tobias Bjornfot]]\n\u003e Yeah, I think it’s going good so far. There’s a little more structure and it’s more intense. In the summer, there’s not anyone watching you and here in camp, it’s more intense and there’s more structure.\n\n\u003eI do like to play in preseason games, it’s nice to get to get you going and get more into game shape. In Sweden, we used to play a lot of preseason games, we had 5-10 then, so I’m used to playing in a longer preseason.\n\n\u003e I worked on my strength, getting stronger and faster, all of that kind of stuff. We’ve got a lot of time during the offseason to work on that. I just wanted to come in ready and prepared for camp, bring my A game to camp.","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.66014768Z","tags":null},"/A-Special-Night-In-St-Paul-A-Look-Inside-Jack-Jablonskis-Gala-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"A Special Night In St Paul - A Look Inside Jack Jablonskis Gala - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# A Special Night In St Paul - A Look Inside Jack Jablonskis Gala - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [A Special Night In St Paul - A Look Inside Jack Jablonskis Gala - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/16/a-special-night-in-st-paul-a-look-inside-jack-jablonskis-gala/) |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[A Special Night In St Paul - A Look Inside Jack Jablonskis Gala - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                                     |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- \n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Jack Jablonski]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Last night was a special one in Minnesota for several reasons.\n\u003e\n\u003e It certainly doesn’t hurt that the Kings picked up their first win of the season, in exciting fashion over the Wild. Independent of the result, however, was an impactful and certainly heartwarming event that tied both teams together in a way that only the hockey community can.\n\u003e\n\u003e That tie is Jack Jablonski, an LA Kings employee – and contributing writer here on LAKI I might add – who grew up in Minnesota as a Wild fan. Jack’s life changed in high school, playing in Minnesota, when a hit he suffered during game play caused a severe spinal cord injury that left him paralyzed from the chest down, with limited movement in his upper body.\n\u003e \n\u003e That’s why a sold-out event gathered hockey fans together in the bowels of Xcel Energy Center before yesterday’s Kings/Wild showdown. Ranging from Kings employees to local Minnesotans, a crowd of around 400 – 500 people showed up for a special evening, the annual Beat Paralysis Gala, held each year in Minnesota.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Jack Jablonski]]\n\u003e This is usually the biggest day of the year for our foundation, it’s a sold-out event and this is our biggest moneymaker so to speak in terms of what we take in annually for donations. For me personally, it’s obviously a grateful day, to see the continued support, not only for myself personally but for the foundation. Everyone who continues to want to help my foundation and I thrive to help people in wheelchairs with spinal injuries. \n\n\u003e Right now a big focus of ours is upper limb function and blatter studies. That has a lot to do with spinal stimulation through electrodes and electricity going into the spinal cord and with tedious therapy and tasks and rehab in terms of function, we work towards improving the lives of people with paralysis in their upper limbs, and also helping to improve the lives of people that have had their bladder affected as well.\n\n\u003e Being able to combine hockey with paralysis research and awareness is something that’s very special and close to my heart. Obviously, it’s two things that are very intertwined in my life and to be able to keep them together for the right cause is something that I don’t take lightly but also I’m very grateful to have the opportunity to do.\n\n\u003e It’s very special to have the Kings and Wild be a part of a night like this. Not only do we have the gala here before the game, but a lot takes place during the game as well. To be able to have the team that I grew up around and loving, as well as the team that I work for and love, is really awesome. Just to have both teams as a part of a night like this, something that we can all celebrate together in terms of focusing in on helping the lives of people with paralysis.\n\n\u003e We’re excited to get that money and be able to take it from donations and put it into clinical trial studies.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.66014768Z","tags":null},"/About":{"title":"About","content":"\n# About\n\nThe LA Kings News and Knowledge Graph is an experiment in curating the existing news about the National Hockey League's Los Angeles Kings franchise. \n\n\n## The Goal\nAt several times in my fandom, I've wanted to compare something that someone wrote about a player in the past and what was being written in the present. Where were those pre-draft quotes about the player who was hitting 500 games? But that all seems to evaporate. What I needed was an index to pull insightful stuff out of the source that hosted it. For example, I love listening to [[Mark Yannetti]] discuss amateur player scouting, evaluation, and drafting, which he's done several times in several different podcasts, videos, and written media. But I don't know where it all is and the significant things he said in them to pull out patterns. So this is my attempt to review and index significant media coverage of the Kings.\n\n## The Vision\nI'm sure that different people might find this site interesting for different reasons. For me, I'd love to be able to read coverage on players over time, especially prospects breaking into the league. If someone has a breakout year, it would be fun to read back through the coverage to see if anything emerges during that breakout; It might be interesting to read the prospect profiles from before and immediately post-draft or during development camps and pre-seasons.\n\n## The Details So Far\n- I review coverage manualy and cross-indexed by events, player, staff, and writer. This is all a work in progress so not all of that cross-referencing is complete. I've emphasized cross-referencing articles by player over writer, site, or staff member (There's a list of all [[Quinton Byfield]] article mentions, but not [[Todd McLellan]] mentions or a master list of articles from [[The Athletic]]).\n- I pull out quotes or headers, but not entire articles. I'm not quite sure where to draw the line on that, but I'm not comfortable pulling out anything besides quotes and main talking points right now. The goal is to have enough information to understand if the article is relevant enough to read at some time in the future.\n- A lot of the sources have identical quotes. I'm not sure what to do about that. The goal of this experiment isn't to replace reading the articles, but to serve as a link to them.\n- I've paid to subscribe to sites to read their content if it seems promising. Right now, the list is:\n\t- [[The Athletic]]\n\t- [[The Hockey Tactics Newsletter]]\n\t- ESPN (well, for the streaming games, not the news coverage)\n\t- [[The Forum Report]]\n\t\n\t- I hope others can decide from my indexing whether or not these sources are worth subscribing to.\n- I'm not including AP game summaries from whomever licenses them, for example, the [[LA Times]]. I'm interested in the original coverage or analysis they might provide.\n\n\nDo you think there's a source of Kings news that I'm not adding to the record? \n\nWhat do you think about the experiment in general? I'll think about the best way to leave feedback.\n\n## The Tools\n- I store coverage notes and cross-reference them in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).\n- I publish the notes using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.66014768Z","tags":null},"/Adrian-Kempe":{"title":"Adrian Kempe","content":"\n# Adrian Kempe\n\nNHL.com | Twitter\n-|-\n[Adrian Kempe](https://www.nhl.com/player/adrian-kempe-8477960) | [@adriankempe](https://twitter.com/adriankempe)\n\nPosition | Shoots | Height | Weight | Age | Birthday | Birthplace | Draft\n-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-\n[[Adrian Kempe]] | 9 | C | L | 6' 2\" | 200 | 1996-09-13 | Kramfors, SWE\n\n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date       | Site                    | Title                                                                                                               |\n| ---------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-17 | [[Mayors Manor]]        | [[Rapid Review - Kings Get Back to Even With OT Win in Motor City]]                                                 |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[ESPN]]                | [[Kings vs Wild - NHL Game Recap - October 15, 2022 - ESPN]]                                                        |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[Kings at NHL.com]]    | [[Kings score seven, hold off late rally by Wild for first win of season]]                                          |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[Hockey Royalty]]      | [[Three takeaways from LA Kings 7-6 wild win vs Minnesota]]                                                         |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[The Athletic]]        | [[Kevin Fiala felt right at home in Minnesota return - ‘I feel pretty confident in this arena’]]                    |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[The Forum Report]]    | [[Possession Chart - 10-15 at MIN]]                                                                                 |\n| 2022-10-15 | [[LA Kings Insider]]    | [[FINAL - Kings 7, Wild 6 - Fiala, Kempe, McLellan - LA Kings Insider]]                                             |\n| 2022-10-12 | [[The Athletic]]        | [[LA Kings hope to ‘settle in’ after penalties and mistakes evident vs Vegas]]                                      |\n| 2022-10-11 | [[The Forum Report]]    | [[Postgame - Terrible LA game management - Bettman talks RSNs with LA media]]                                       |\n| 2022-10-11 | [[ESPN]]                | [Golden Knights vs Kings - Game Recap - October 11, 2022 - ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nhl/recap/_/gameId/401458592) |\n| 2022-10-11 | [[LA Kings Insider]]    | [[FINAL - Kings 3, Golden Knights 4 - Vilardi, Kopitar, McLellan - LA Kings Insider]]                               |\n| 2022-10-10 | [[LA Kings on YouTube]] | [[Head Coach Todd McLellan speaks to the media after Mondays practice]]                                             |\n| 2022-10-06 | [[LA Kings Insider]]    | [[PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 4, Golden Knights 6 – Kempe, Durzi, McLellan]]                                            |\n| 2022-10-03 | [[LA Kings Insider]]    | [[With a fresh slate, the work is well underway when it comes to the LA Kings power play]]                          |\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\nDate | Site| Title\n---|---|---\n\n\n## Post-Draft Coverage\nDate | Site| Title\n---|---|---\n\n\n## Pre-Draft Coverage\nDate | Site| Title\n---|---|---\n\n\n## Unprocessed Coverage \n- ","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.66014768Z","tags":null},"/After-a-mentally-and-physically-challenging-summer-Viktor-Arvidsson-is-looking-to-the-bright-side-in-camp":{"title":"After a mentally and physically challenging summer, Viktor Arvidsson is looking to the bright side in camp","content":"\n# After a mentally and physically challenging summer, Viktor Arvidsson is looking to the bright side in camp\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-09-30 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [After a mentally and physically challenging summer, Viktor Arvidsson is looking to the bright side in camp](http://lakingsinsider.com/2022/09/30/after-a-mentally-and-physically-challenging-summer-viktor-arvidsson-is-looking-to-the-bright-side-in-camp/)\n2022-09-30 | [[LA Kings Insider]] |  [[After a mentally and physically challenging summer, Viktor Arvidsson is looking to the bright side in camp]]\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e As noted this morning, Viktor Arvidsson moved into the full group today for the first time during training camp, as he continues to work his way back from offseason back surgery. Joining him for his second day with Group A was Sean Durzi, who is recovering from offseason shoulder surgery. For that reason, these two players are linked, though it would be unfair to compare their timelines in any way.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n\u003e Nothing like this, during my last year in Nashville I had the same thing happen and I was gone for two weeks but I played that year’s playoffs,” Arvidsson said. “So this was the first time that happened this seriously.\n\n\u003e It was the toughest part of our jobs, I think, to play all those games and then when it matters, you can’t contribute with the guys on the team. It was really tough, me and Drew sat on the side, dreading ourselves \\[for not being in there], but it happens and we had to deal with it.\n\n\u003e It was tough, especially for my family and for me, mentally it was really tough. I couldn’t be with my daughter, play with her, that was the toughest part about everything I think. Coming back here, I hadn’t skated, so I started to skate and felt fine and I started to look to the brighter side. I feel confident and we’ll just take it day by day now, see if I can get out of the red jersey.\n\n\u003e It was completely different from what I’m used to. It was a lot of just focusing on what I had to do to be ready and stuff and not a lot of family activities. It was tough at that point, but I was making sacrifices and I’m here now and I feel really good about myself.\n\n\u003e It’s fun, we go way back, we were roommates in Milwaukee. He’s a great guy, a great player. I think a lot of younger guys can learn from him, his skill set and how he wants to get better every day. He’s great, I really, really enjoy having him here.\n\n\u003e I don’t know yet, it’s day by day. We’re just trying to get me back with the players again and we’ll see how it goes\n\n\u003e Yeah, for sure. I didn’t see the games in Ontario the other day, but I feel like [[Gabe Vilardi|Gabe]] has taken a step with his skating and with his control of the puck. Especially offensively, he’s dangerous when he has the puck and he’s creative. Same with [[Quinton Byfield|Q]] and [[Arthur Kaliyev|Arthur]], others too, they made steps the last year and hopefully they continue to grow.\n\n\u003e It was a lot of fun \\[to skate with the full group today]. Just good to be back.\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.66014768Z","tags":null},"/Aidan-Dudas":{"title":"Aidan Dudas","content":"\n# Aidan Dudas\n\nNHL.com / Ontario Reign | Twitter\n-|-\n[Aidan Dudas](https://ontarioreign.com/roster/aidan-dudas) | [@twitter_handle](https://twitter.com/)\n\nPlayer | \\# | Position | Shoots | Height | Weight | Born | Birthplace | Draft \n-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-\nAidan Dudas | 47 | F | R | 5' 7\" | 164 | 2000-06-15 | Parry Sound, ON, CAN | LAK 4th RD, 2018 (113th)\n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\nDate | Site |  Title\n---|---|---\n\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\nDate | Site |  Title\n---|---|---\n\n\n\n## Post-Draft Coverage\nDate | Site |  Title\n---|---|---\n\n\n\n## Pre-Draft Coverage\nDate | Site |  Title\n---|---|---\n\n\n## Unprocessed Coverage\n- \n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.66014768Z","tags":null},"/Akil-Thomas":{"title":"Akil Thomas","content":"\n# Akil Thomas\n\nNHL.com / Ontario Reign | Twitter\n-|-\n[Akil Thomas](https://www.nhl.com/player/akil-thomas-8480851) | [@AkilThomas2](https://twitter.com/AkilThomas2)\n\nPlayer | \\# | Position | Shoots | Height | Weight | Born | Birthplace | Draft \n-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-\nAkil Thomas | 86 | C | R | 6' 0\" | 195 | 2000-02-02 | Toronto, ON, CAN | 2018 LAK, 2nd rd, 20th pk (51st overall)\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\nDate | Site |  Title\n---|---|---\n2022-09-27 | [[LA Kings Insider]] |  [[Day 6 Primer + The Differences Between Playing Center and Playing Winger]]\n2022-09-25 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[9-25 Preview – Projected Game Group + early camp notes on Roy, Clarke and Thomas]]\n\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\n| Date       | Site               | Title                                                          |\n| ---------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-14 | [[Mayors Manor]]   | [[Ontario Reign -

That start goes beyond the two goals he scored last night. It goes beyond the spot on the first power play unit he’s manned early in training camp. It goes beyond the opportunity he’s currently seizing by skating with the second forward line.\n\n## Notes\n### On Attitude\n\n\u003e It looks like he’s having a lot of fun and I think that’s a huge part of it. Give him credit for being enthusiastic and being excited and his teammates love playing with him right now that’s a real good sign. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e When Gabe is having fun, it’s infectious and I think he plays his best hockey when he’s having fun. I think when he’s stressed, or he’s not feeling great about his game, it weighs on him. It feels like he’s in a great headspace \\[right now] and we need that going forward. -- [[Trevor Moore]]\n\n\u003e You can tell his vibes are so positive and he wants to be a game changer. It’s definitely a big difference I’ve seen so far this year and we need him. We need him to be like that and the more players we have like that, the better we’ll be. -- [[Phillip Danault]]\n\n### On Skill\n\n\u003e Gabe has always been a big, strong kid, you can see that when he wins puck battles. He’s working really hard right now and I think it’s showing. The skill has always been there, it’s just a matter of him getting that confidence and doing those little things. -- [[Trevor Moore]]\n\n### On the switch from Center to Wing\n\n\u003e I’ve got to continue to work on \\[the defensive zone], you can always get better with your wall play and that’s important for me when playing as a winger, taking care of my own zone first. I’ve been on the wing for around a year now and I’m still adjusting. I’m going to continue to work and take it day-by-day. -- [[Gabe Vilardi]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.66014768Z","tags":null},"/Andre-Lee":{"title":"Andre Lee","content":"\n# Andre Lee\n\n| EliteProspects | Twitter                                 |\n| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| [Andre Lee](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/350001/andre-lee)           | [@twitter_handle](https://twitter.com/) | \n\n| Player        | \\#  | Position | Shoots | Height | Weight | Born       | Birthplace    | Draft                        |\n| ------------- | --- | -------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ---------- | ------------- | ---------------------------- |\n| [[Andre Lee]] | 26  | LW/C     | L      | 6' 4\"  | 205    | 2000-07-26 | Karlstad, SWE | LAK 7th Rd 2019, 188 overall | \n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n|      |      |       |\n\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n|      |      |       |\n\n\n\n## Post-Draft Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n|      |      |       |\n\n\n\n## Pre-Draft Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n|      |      |       |\n\n\n## Unprocessed Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n|      |      |       |\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.66014768Z","tags":null},"/Angeles-Analysis-A-Tough-Start-and-A-New-Approach-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"Angeles Analysis - A Tough Start and A New Approach - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# Angeles Analysis - A Tough Start and A New Approach - LA Kings Insider\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-14 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [Angeles Analysis - A Tough Start and A New Approach - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/14/angeles-analysis-a-tough-start-a-new-approach/)\n2022-10-14 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[Angeles Analysis - A Tough Start and A New Approach - LA Kings Insider]]\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- \n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e A challenging opening two games at home have left the Kings at 0-2-0, after losses to Vegas and Seattle. For a team that entered the season with expectations to build and grow off of last season’s playoff berth, it’s not the start to the season that anyone had hoped for, though it’s also something that Todd McLellan warned us would be possible. With new expectations, comes a different type of season.\n\nThe team we should be comparing these Kings to is the team at the start of last season, not the one that ended it.\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e As we go forward now, we’ll have to lay game two against game one because now we’re starting to get this year’s evidence. Maybe we’re going to be a loose, gambling, score five per night team and get it done that way, I don’t know, but that looked like how we wanted to play. If we feel as a group that’s where our identity has to go and we’re going to try it that way, great, but I’m not betting on it. We either reestablish who we are, or we try it a different way.   -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e We’re trying to figure out who we are, how do we want to play the game? For the media that was there this morning or yesterday, it doesn’t happen automatically, you get to recreate yourself every year. The reference point that we had after game one was last year, now we have six periods in the bag.  -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.66014768Z","tags":null},"/Angeles-Analysis-Next-Stop-Regular-Season-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"Angeles Analysis - Next Stop, Regular Season - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# Angeles Analysis - Next Stop, Regular Season - LA Kings Insider\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-09 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [Angeles Analysis - Next Stop, Regular Season - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/09/angeles-analysis-next-stop-regular-season/)\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n## Players\n- \n\n## Summary\n\u003e Nothing too crazy today, with the team off from practice on a transition day between the preseason and the regular season. The Kings have two players on waivers today – Jacob Moverare and Pheonix Copley – as we approach the official, roster submission in advance of Tuesday’s season opener. We’ll receive the fate of those two individuals in the morning, with a massive list of players on waivers today from around the league. We’ll receive official clarity on the roster tomorrow, though with those two moves now made, you can pretty much see how the Kings will roll entering Opening Night from a roster standpoint, though you can’t rule out what could happen with waivers or injuries over the next 24 hours.\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.66014768Z","tags":null},"/Angeles-Analysis-Thoughts-From-The-First-Week-Of-Training-Camp":{"title":"Angeles Analysis – Thoughts From The First Week Of Training Camp","content":"\n# Angeles Analysis – Thoughts From The First Week Of Training Camp\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-09-29 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [Angeles Analysis – Thoughts From The First Week Of Training Camp](http://lakingsinsider.com/2022/09/29/angeles-analysis-thoughts-from-the-first-week-of-training-camp/)\n2022-09-29 | [[LA Kings Insider]] |  [[Angeles Analysis – Thoughts From The First Week Of Training Camp]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n- [[Sean Walker]]\n- [[Sean Durzi]]\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Samuel Fagemo]]\n- [[Austin Wagner]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings have a full team off day today, with no on-ice practices scheduled until tomorrow morning.

This is an old plane, and most of the planes I enjoy flying have the latest technological improvements and bulkhead maintenance, but this one’s are suspect, and after a reboot of a faulty internet (and entertainment systems), we were up and running with the world at our fingertips. Notes from a travel day ahead of an interesting five-gamer:\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e I was thinking about it for a while. After the first couple shifts, I just wanted to talk to my dad, talk to my mom, see what they thought. It was special to see them. That meant the world to me that they were out here this whole week.  -- [[Brandt Clarke]] \n\n\u003e It’s pretty cool, you’re just thinking about it. It’s officially forever now – I’ve played in the NHL, so it’s a really cool feeling.  -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e It’s different. But it’s still cool because I still have all my family and friends there, which is most important. But Joe Lewis has obviously has a vibe that can’t be matched, really. It’s cool. The rink is beautiful, it’s nice, I’m excited to go back.  -- [[Matt Roy]]\n\n\u003e It’s hard to see everyone I want to see, but I just think I’m going to keep it close with direct family and maybe have a couple guys over for dinner.  -- [[Matt Roy]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.66014768Z","tags":null},"/Bettman-Speaks-in-Los-Angeles-+-Reign-Sign-Thompson-Hrenak-to-Greenville-Seeley-On-Season-Ahead-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"Bettman Speaks in Los Angeles + Reign Sign Thompson, Hrenak to Greenville, Seeley On Season Ahead - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# Bettman Speaks in Los Angeles + Reign Sign Thompson, Hrenak to Greenville, Seeley On Season Ahead - LA Kings Insider\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-12 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [Bettman Speaks in Los Angeles + Reign Sign Thompson, Hrenak to Greenville, Seeley On Season Ahead - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/12/bettman-speaks-in-los-angeles-reign-sign-thompson-hrenak-to-greenville-seeley-on-season-ahead/)\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- \n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Gary Bettman]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman was among those in attendance on Opening Night in Los Angeles.\n\u003e Bettman addressed a wide array of issues, though few truly pertained to the Kings\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e The cap basically only goes up by a million per year until the escrow is paid off, and people tend to forget that the escrow got very large during COVID, because even when the revenues were down, we paid in accordance with the contracts.

Coming into camp, for sure some confidence right off the bat with both [[Brendan Lemieux|Pep]] and [[Carl Grundstrom|Grundy]] too actually, I played a few games with him last year so we kind of knew what he brought to the table. Right from the get go, it’s been really comfortable. --[[Blake Lizotte]]\n\n\u003e Yeah, I would say that they’ve become a pair. I thought both of them missed each other when they were hurt last year, for different reasons, but I do see them being a pair. They’re wired in completely different ways, Pep is a big personality, [[Blake Lizotte|Lizzo]] is a little more of a quiet personality, but it blends well and that’s the personal part of it. The on-ice part, they both play that tenacious style of hockey, they enjoy forechecking, they don’t have to be cute. Pretty straight and direct production from them and I think they push each other too, they keep each other honest and they push each other.  -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e I think Grunny is as skilled as a depth player as I’ve played with and I’ve played with a few highly skilled ones. He makes a lot of really good plays, he’s got great hands and a terrific shot, but I love the simplicity that his game has and I think that’s when he’s at his best. He’s got two guys that complement that simplicity well, but it’s nice to have the guy you know you can get the puck too and he can beat someone 1-on-1 or he can make a backhand sauce pass right on the tape. A lot of guys who play in those bottom six roles don’t have the ability to do that, so it’s an ideal line. -- [[Brendan Lemieux]]\n\n\u003e I think he’s gotten better every year, he’s shown that he’s very capable of playing in high pressure situations, in playoffs last year. Even leading up to that, yeah he wasn’t in the lineup for a couple of nights but there were other reasons for that. We think he can be a full-time player and be an effective full-time player. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003eI think Grundy brings a different element to Pep and my games, he’s shown so far in preseason that his skill has grown and he’s become more of a complete player, especially in the d-zone. He’s a workhorse, Pep and I have both already talked about it and there’s no shortage of work on our line. It’s really nice to have a guy that’s willing to get in there in the trenches with us. It seems like it’s been clicking so far in camp. -- [[Blake Lizotte]]\n\n\u003e Grunny has a little bit more forechecking and a little bit more skating to his game, a little bit more speed in the tighter areas. It’s a bit different, but it actually makes Lizzo and my loads easier as far as skating, it helps us conserve a little bit of energy so that it can be used for more forechecking and more offense. It’s just a different look, you know, Arty is a pure shooter he likes to be high, in different areas and Grunny likes to be lower, in the paint and around the net and digging pucks. It’s a different look but it’s obviously one that works whether we play with Arty, Grunny or not together. I think our games always try to stay the same. -- [[Brendan Lemieux]]\n\n\u003e It’s been pretty good, I played a little bit with \\[Lizotte] last year too, so I kind of knew what to expect and we’re finding each other well so far, so it’s been good. All of us want to play North-South and play directly. I think that fits us really, really well to play that way. -- [[Carl Grundstrom]]\n\n\u003e We think Grunny complements \\[Lizotte and Lemieux]. They play, I call it a hunt game, they’re on top of teams, creating turnovers, buzzing, physicality and momentum. It can be really effective, we do trust them defensively, they do good job there. We believe they can be a real good line but when it really gets going, they’re going to have to live up to that. They’re very capable of it. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.66014768Z","tags":null},"/Blake-excited-about-3C-slot-for-Byfield-as-Kopitar-and-Danault-and-Matthews-provide-influence":{"title":"Blake excited about 3C slot for Byfield as Kopitar and Danault – and Matthews – provide influence","content":"\n# Blake excited about 3C slot for Byfield as Kopitar and Danault – and Matthews – provide influence\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-13 | [[The Forum Report]] | [Blake excited about 3C slot for Byfield as Kopitar and Danault – and Matthews – provide influence](https://theforumreport.com/blake-excited-about-3c-slot-for-byfield-as-kopitar-and-danault-and-matthews-provide-influence/)\n2022-10-13 | [[The Forum Report]] | [[Blake excited about 3C slot for Byfield as Kopitar and Danault – and Matthews – provide influence]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jon Rosen]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n- [[Phillip Danault]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e It’s about time to stop talking about the Iafallo-Byfield-Vilardi line’s performance Tuesday night, but there was one loose end to stitch, and that was the visibility of Quinton Byfield on the backcheck.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e I get to see that first hand every day, every game. There are a lot of guys. Even \\[Auston] Matthews has developed that game, as well. I watch a lot of his games. Bergeron’s obviously won a bunch of Selkes.  -- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\n\u003e Just where he sits in the lineup is what we’re excited about and allowing him to become the player he \\[is]. He had a tough injury that set him back \\[last season], but both times he’s come into camp ready to go, and looked to us like he could earn that spot, and he’ll get his chance there now.  -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\u003e “I think we’re all pretty big bodies, skate well. I think most of our forecheck, we got on ‘em early \\[Tuesday], stripping pucks. Gabe, he’s hot right now, he has crazy skill, and I think \\[we] have chemistry from playing in the AHL, as well.

It is the lap in which teammates send that player out to the ice first and all alone for the warm-up skate before they join him.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e I had put on my jersey, and I was reaching up for my gear. My gloves were up there (on a shelf) and the guys were yelling across the room, ‘Don’t even think about it. Don’t even try.’ I didn’t put it on.  -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e I just felt like it took forever to be honest with you. Probably to you guys, it’s like 10 seconds. To me, it felt like five minutes. I was just out there with all those eyes on me. I think I didn’t stop smiling for like five minutes into warm-up.\n\u003e It was a good feeling. I saw my parents right away. I looked up to where they were sitting. They were there with smiles on their faces and their phone out and stuff like that. It’s a moment I’ll never forget.  -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e There’s enough that’s going on in their world right now. First game. Family in town. We don’t want to overburden him with details. We want him to play the game. We want him to enjoy the process. I think the less he has on his mind and more instinctual hockey, the better chance he has for success.\n\u003e We haven’t sat with him and gone through everything and what to expect and what not to expect. If he comes to us, we’ll certainly help him. But we’ll leave him alone.  -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e This is the moment I have dreamt of for so long. I’ve been watching the NHL for my entire life and now that I’m officially going to be in it, it’s kind of crazy to think. This is going to be something I never forget. It’s pretty cool.  -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e He’s fine penalty-killing. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e We’re shorthanded for four of the first 6 1/2 minutes of the game,. Once we settled in, that allowed Brandt to play a little bit more.  -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e Definitely first couple of shifts, the puck was on my stick too long. Every time I turned, there was one of their offensive players coming to lay a body check on me. It as definitely a wake-up call right away. The puck’s got to move quick. Got to know where everyone is on the ice. I think I adapted pretty well throughout the game, and it was crisper later in the game. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e I came into the room, and I was like, ‘Wow'. Every time I had the puck, no one brushed by me or anything (and) you’re not getting laid out but they’re finishing on you. It’s just something you got to get adjusted to as well. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e It was a good feeling. To be relied on in that situation. That’s what they wanted. They wanted a spark of offense, and they trusted it in our hands. We tried and made some good plays at the blue line. Drew’s obviously Drew. He’s smart with the puck and got shots through. I’m just trying to make some play to get the puck in his hands. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e We dressed six defensemen tonight. I know he wasn’t (a) 6. Pretty sure he wasn’t 5. And I don’t believe he was 4 either. That’s what I thought of him. I thought he had a real good night.\n\u003e Didn’t hurt us at all defensively. Creative offensively. I’d like to see him shoot the puck a little bit because I think he’s got a great shot. Loves to pass but he had some real good looks at the net where he could have shot the puck. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e I thought my third period was my best period. Personally, you don’t want to say your happy because we lost and it leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. But I’m definitely happy that I got that first one out of the way and I’m just going to try to keep progressing from here. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.664147713Z","tags":null},"/Breakout-Candidates-in-the-Pacific-Division":{"title":"Breakout Candidates in the Pacific Division","content":"\n# Breakout Candidates in the Pacific Division\n\n| Date       | Site                | Link                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| ---------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-06 | [[The Hockey News]] | [Breakout Candidates in the Pacific Division](https://thehockeynews.com/news/breakout-candidates-in-the-pacific-division#:~:text=LOS%20ANGELES%20KINGS%3A-,QUINTON%20BYFIELD,-%2C%20C) |\n| 2022-10-06 | [[The Hockey News]] | [[Breakout Candidates in the Pacific Division]]                                                                                                                                        |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Tony Ferrari]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The second overall pick in the 2020 NHL draft was set to take on a bigger role with the Kings last year before a fractured ankle in a pre-season game derailed his season.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.664147713Z","tags":null},"/Brendan-Lemieux":{"title":"Brendan Lemieux","content":"\n# Brendan Lemieux\n\nNHL.com / Ontario Reign | Twitter\n-|-\n[Brendan Lemieux](https://www.nhl.com/player/brendan-lemieux-8477962) | [@blemieux22](https://twitter.com/blemieux22)\n\nPlayer | \\# | Position | Shoots | Height | Weight | Born | Birthplace | Draft \n-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-\nBrendan Lemieux | 48 | LW | L | 6' 1\" | 215 | 1996-03-15 | Denver, CO, USA | 2014 BUF, 2nd rd, 1st pk (31st overall)\n\n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\nDate | Site |  Title\n---|---|---\n2022-10-14 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[Practice 10-14 -

Good for us to have a few of those right now. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e Kevin and I have had a lot of climate changes over the years. -- [[Dean Evanson]]\n\n\u003e We played better in the preseason, I think. I can see our line will be very effective, and I think tonight will be the night. -- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n\u003e That’s a true quality of his.\n\u003e I think by this point he understand our demeanor. When I say, ‘ours,’ our coaching staff. But also his teammates – who’s emotional, who isn’t, what gets guys riled up, what’s the boiling point between good and bad? And often for a player, once that gets clarified, it’s a lot easier. … But it is way more about the Kings than it is Kevin tonight. I wish it was the other way, but it just isn’t. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.664147713Z","tags":null},"/Cameron-Gaunce":{"title":"Cameron Gaunce","content":"\n# Cameron Gaunce\n\nNHL.com / Ontario Reign | Twitter\n-|-\n[Cameron Gaunce]() | [@twitter_handle](https://twitter.com/)\n\nPlayer | \\# | Position | Shoots | Height | Weight | Born | Birthplace | Draft \n-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-\n[[Cameron Gaunce]] | 24 | D | L | 6' 2\" | 196 | 1990-03-19 | Sudbury, ON, CAN | COL 2nd RD, 2008 (50th)\n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\nDate | Site |  Title\n---|---|---\n\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\nDate | Site |  Title\n---|---|---\n2022-10-14 | [[Mayors Manor]] | [[Ontario Reign - Opening Night Lineup vs Abbotsford Canucks]]\n2022-10-06 | [[Ontario Reign on Youtube]] | [[Cameron Gaunce - Reign Training Camp Day 1]]\n\n\n\n## Post-Draft Coverage\nDate | Site |  Title\n---|---|---\n\n\n\n## Pre-Draft Coverage\nDate | Site |  Title\n---|---|---\n\n\n## Unprocessed Coverage\n- \n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.664147713Z","tags":null},"/Cameron-Gaunce-Reign-Training-Camp-Day-1":{"title":"Cameron Gaunce - Reign Training Camp Day 1","content":"\n# Cameron Gaunce - Reign Training Camp Day 1\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n 2022-10-08   |   | [Cameron Gaunce - Reign Training Camp Day 1](https://youtu.be/EXbVkm4sLms)\n\n## Contributors\n- \n\n## Players\n- [[Cameron Gaunce]]\n\n## Summary\n\n\n## Notes\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EXbVkm4sLms\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n\u003e Q: today was day one of of camp but you\nguys have been skating together now for\na little while\num what's the familiarity with with\neverybody and how nice was it to kind of\nstart to see a little bit more of the\ngroup form as the king starts to\nofficially cut down their roster a\nlittle bit \n\u003e A: I think today was great uh\nlast couple days we've been skating and\nit's relatively similar group so that\nlike you said the familiarity was\nkind of already there but it's nice to\nbe officially part of it we went back to\nour original numbers in the American\nHockey League guys are more\nuh present if you will because again\nwhen you're still considered big-league guys\nare there's more longing for the\npotential to obey there obviously is\nstill the\nkind of the thought they want to get\ncalled up you want to get brought back\nbut you also know that right now the\nrealities are set in a bit and that's\nwhen you can start to really focus on\nyour present really focus on where you\nare at the time being and I thought that\nhappened I think Marco, heider, and Schulz\nhave been doing an excellent job of\nstaying with us staying on top of us\nmaking sure we understand that we're the\nOntario Reign right now and I thought\ntoday was a great first\nstep \n\n\u003e Q: what's your impressions of Marco\nstarting to get to know him a little bit\nbetter I know he's not a new coach for a\nlot of guys they've had familiarity but\nyou know what have you seen him do\nthat's maybe a little bit different\nwhat's his style so far that you've seen\n\u003e A: uh I feel like he's extremely organized\nwhich I love uh like we've already had a\nfew conversations about a few dates down\nthe road and I absolutely loved\ntop of things has a plan in place so\nthere's no questioning any of that stuff\nthat again it's not to say that Chris\nheide last year didn't have the same thing\nbut it's just different coming from a\nnew voice uh he's been the other thing\nthat you notice right away and talking\nwith Marco is a very caring person and I\nthink especially in the American Hockey League\nthat's very key to the players\nunderstand that the coach not only cares\nabout winning and his own career when he\ncarries with the player uh where some\ndisconnect can sometimes go on when\nplayers are thinking no one's\nlooks like Marco really cares about each\nand every one of us it's present and\nit's something that just adds to the\noverall experience as him as a coach\n\n\u003e Q: you've been around this league for for a\nwhile now how do you feel like the\ntalent level is on this roster maybe\nwhen you when you see at the beginning\nof the year I know that last year the\nteam felt like they had a lot of talent\ntoo but when you look at you know some\nof the new pieces that have been added\nin some new faces where do you feel like\nthe talent level of the roster is at? \n\u003e A: I\nthink the talent level is high like again it's we\ndon't have the full roster right yet\nwith with the Kings still having a few\nguys which means we're gonna be getting\neven more talented players so it's we're at\na stage already where we've got a team\nthat can compete and I think adding a\ncouple more guys from  the Kings will just\nkind of push us over that top the best\nthing about the American Hockey League\non any given day your roster could be\ncompletely overhauled we went one\nweekend last year with one forward\nplaying defense along with three\ncall-ups and we only had five of us so\nthe next two weekends later we had 8 D, we\nhad too many so it can change in the\nblink of an eye due to injuries call-ups\nthings beyond our control so it's it's\nhard not to look into the future you\nwant to kind of see the type of Team you\ncan put together but you have to worry\nabout the team you have the team we have\nright now is a good team we can\nabsolutely compete and with the systems\nthat we have in place the better we play\nthem the better we're going to be as a\ngroup \n\n\u003e Q: for you why'd you make the\ndecision to come back you know what are\nsome of the factors that that went into\nthat decision and how excited are you\nfor for a new slate your new season\n\u003e A: I was excited at the opportunity to come\nback just because of my career I bounced\naround quite\nit's going to be my third year with the\nsame organization what's going\nfamiliarity as we talked about the first\nquestion it's something that was very\nimportant for me like I come in this\nseason the coaching staff already knows\nexactly who I am as a person who I am as\na player so we already have that we\nalready have that piece of this they\nknow what to expect from me they I know\nwhat to expect from them I understand my\nrole on and off the ice and that just\nmakes me more comfortable than my\nability to grow is that much more now\nthat the basis is down my ability to\ngrow as both the personal player is more\nI'm more capable to do that so I think\nthat was the biggest thing was just\ncoming back being part of the\norganization feeling wanted uh because\nagain someone like myself\nthere's times you just want to feel\nrelevant you want to feel like you're\nwanted this was an organization that\nexpressed want and that was something\nthat I really enjoyed \n\n\u003e Q: last thing this is\na bit of a condensed Camp you only have\na few days you get one preseason game\nand then all of a sudden next week\nyou're going to be gearing up for the\nhome opener already so what are some of\nthe things that that you feel that the\nteam needs to work on in these days to\nmake sure they're ready to start the\nseason and have a good start \n\u003e A: I think\nmaking sure that things that\nthere's certain tenets that we're really trying to harp on \nthat's the key obviously you can start\nbuilding on a few other things but if we\ncan really start\ncoming together as a group in terms of\nunderstanding where each other going to\nbe we need to be a predictable team like\nobviously we've got a guy like [[T.J. Tynan|Tynan]]\nhe's unpredictable because he's that\ngood but not everyone can play like like\ntimes so if we can become more\npredictable as a group earlier on like\nthis week\nstarting coming in this upcoming weekend\nand then moving into the opening slate\nof games without predictability can just\nmake you play better within it because\nthen all of a sudden things start\nhappening quicker that's where teams\nthat's where the term Pace really comes\ninto play I\nplays with pace is one that knows what's\nhappening with each other moving the\nfast skating fastest paces and just\nskating fast because if that was the\ncase we've got [[Austin Wagner]] who's\nfastest skater of the league\nbut playing with pace is playing as a\ngroup moving in five man units and\nunderstanding where each other they're\ngoing to be so the better we can do that\nearlier on I think the more successful I\nwould start of the year because you\ncan't win the season you can't win the\nregular season in the opening month but\nyou can put yourself in a big hole.\n\u003e Cameron thanks very much for joining us\nand we look forward to talking to you\nthroughout the season of course anytime","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.664147713Z","tags":null},"/Carl-Grundstrom":{"title":"Carl Grundstrom","content":"\n# Carl Grundstrom\n\nNHL.com / Ontario Reign | Twitter\n-|-\n[Carl Grundstrom](https://www.nhl.com/player/carl-grundstrom-8479336) | [@carlgrundstrom](https://twitter.com/carlgrundstrom)\n\nPlayer | \\# | Position | Shoots | Height | Weight | Born | Birthplace | Draft \n-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-\nCarl Grundstrom | 91 | RW | L | 6' 0\" | 195 | 1997-12-01 | Umea, SWE | 2016 TOR, 2nd rd, 27th pk (57th overall)\n\n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date       | Site                 | Title                                                                                                |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-17 | [[The Forum Report]] | [[Quick projected - Roy expecting 150 supporters - Grundstrom in for Kaliyev - Määttä on LA growth]]                                                                                                                        |\n| 2022-10-17 | [[The Forum Report]] | [[Good morning, Detroit]]                                                                            |\n| 2022-10-13 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | 10-13 Preview - Clarke Debut Expected + Arvidsson out, 19-55-13 Line, Being First - LA Kings Insider |\n| 2022-09-29 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[Blake Lizotte and Brendan Lemieux excited to add Carl Grundstrom to buzzing, physical line]]       |\n| 2022-09-27 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[Day 6 Notes – Injury Updates + Grundstrom Opportunity, Anderson Debut and Kempe joins ATKM]]       |\n| 2022-09-25 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 2, Sharks 3 OT – McLellan takeaways + Clarke preseason debut and notes]]   |\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\nDate | Site |  Title\n---|---|---\n\n\n\n## Post-Draft Coverage\nDate | Site |  Title\n---|---|---\n\n\n\n## Pre-Draft Coverage\nDate | Site |  Title\n---|---|---\n\n\n## Unprocessed Coverage\n- \n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.664147713Z","tags":null},"/Could-LA-Kings-Kaliyev-Have-a-Big-2022-2023-Season":{"title":"Could LA Kings Kaliyev Have a Big 2022-2023 Season","content":"\n# Could LA Kings Kaliyev Have a Big 2022-2023 Season\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-11 | [[Hockey Royalty]] | [Could LA Kings Kaliyev Have a Big 2022-2023 Season](https://hockeyroyalty.com/2022/10/11/could-la-kings-kaliyev-have-a-big-2022-2023-season-offensively/)\n2022-10-11 | [[Hockey Royalty]] | [[Could LA Kings Kaliyev Have a Big 2022-2023 Season]]\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Rjel]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Arthur Kaliyev]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e LA Kings forward Arthur Kaliyev is one of the more important pieces at the wing position going into the 2022-2023 season.

You see the business aspect of things for the first time in your career and I have a good enough team that they allowed me to focus on myself and focus on what I can control and let them handle things on that side. -- [[Sean Durzi]]\n\n\u003e There were tons of options, you can go down the list. When you’re doing a contract negotiation, it’s not really one deal and you’re set on negotiating on that. It’s term, money, all that stuff and that was the first time I realized it was that much of a discussion. Like I said, I’m not Drew Doughty and I can’t just walk in there and go ask for whatever I want. It was a process, there were a lot of different options on the table and I’m really happy with what we got done. -- [[Sean Durzi]]\n\n\u003e Those guys came in and did an amazing job and they earned their keep, so that’s good for us,. The left side is not something that’s completely new to me and Royzie and I actually came up together and played in Ontario together and I was on the leftt side there, so it’s not super foreign to me. It’s just about reps and getting comfortable with it all over again, just kind of like everything right now. -- [[Sean Walker]]\n\n\u003e There are certain aspects of it, the o-zone for one, where I feel more comfortable walking off the wall. In the neutral zone, you’ve got to work with just some different aspects being a righty playing on the opposite side. There wil be some things that we figured out along the way, but I think it’s a really good opportunity for us to be really successful on the back end. -- [[Sean Walker]]\n\n\u003e Not everybody likes playing \\[their off side] and I’m all about comfort, I don’t want to put guys into situations to fail. If they’re not comfortable playing their off side, I’m not going to play him on that off side. With Walks, this is my fourth year here and he’s shown the ability to play both sides and not be affected by it too much. Durz is another one who has emerged into that role. You’ve got to play with the hand that you’re dealt, and that’s kind of what we have in our organization. -- [[Trent Yawney]]\n\n\u003e We have a plethora of right-handed defenseman, which isn’t a bad thing. If someone is going to play on the left, it’s making sure you find the right guy and make sure he’s paired with the right guy, and it works the other way too. There are lots of guys that play on their off side and like I said, it’s more about comfort. For some guys, it just doesn’t feel right and you notice it right away, so I’ll usually just pull the plug on that real quick. -- [[Trent Yawney]]\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.664147713Z","tags":null},"/Day-12-Primer-Groupings-+-McLellan-on-roster-cutdown-and-waivers":{"title":"Day 12 Primer – Groupings + McLellan on roster cutdown and waivers","content":"\n# Day 12 Primer – Groupings + McLellan on roster cutdown and waivers\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-03 | [[LA Kings Insider]] |  [Day 12 Primer – Groupings + McLellan on roster cutdown \u0026 waivers](http://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/03/day-12-primer-groupings-mclellan-on-roster-cutdown-waivers/)\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n## Players\n- \n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings are back on the ice this morning to begin the homestretch of training camp. With the final week before what is called camp becomes practice, the Kings hit the ice in two groups once again, with a potential roster cutdown on the horizon.\n\n## Notes\n- [[Quinton Byfield]] is day-to-day with an illness\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e Our American League team is going to begin camp \\[this week], so I think at that point, you’ll probably see a large group of players assigned to the Ontario Reign. The luxury of having your own \\[AHL] team here right now is that we’re all in the same training camp, we’re sharing a facility. Players have already found homes, they know they’re going to play on one of the two teams and were progressing as one big group. We’ve divided the group with a little bit of forward thinking in mind, if you will, so the official transcript if that’s what you’re looking for may come fairly early this week.\n\n\u003e When we look at some of the other lines, there are players that we wanted to keep together there so now, we look at what’s leftover, we put them together and all three are battling for positions. All three are utility guys, where they can move around from position to position and I thought all three had good nights. The evaluation will continue tomorrow in practice and the day after and the day after. You know, the unfortunate thing is not everybody can play, we’re only allowed like everybody else so many roster spots and it’s a cruel thing, but that’s a fact of pro sports. Somebody is going to be here and somebody won’t and they’ll sort themselves out as time goes on.\n\n\u003e That would be a much better question for Rob and the management group, on waiver timing, who goes when and what triggers it. I’m not privy to that, we’ll talk about who we may want to keep and who we don’t keep, but as far as timing goes and what not, my experience is that every team is concerned about losing players on waivers at this time of the year, that 32 of them. Again, not everybody can play, you only get 23 spots so inevitably, some players have to be waived.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.664147713Z","tags":null},"/Day-14-Primer-The-Split":{"title":"Day 14 Primer – The Split","content":"\n# Day 14 Primer – The Split\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-05 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [Day 14 Primer – The Split](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/05/day-14-primer-the-split/)\n\n## Contributors:\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n## Players\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings group has been reduced to 34 skaters, though we’re seeing a group with fewer individuals truly in action with the Kings when factoring in injuries and illnesses.\n\n## Notes\n\u003e [[Todd McLellan]] has said in past years that he prefers a smaller group when working with his regular NHL roster, designed to maximize repititions and minimize standing around during drills.\n\n\u003e No [[Quinton Byfield]] on the ice this morning, who is labeled as day-to-day with an illness.\n\n- [[Ontario Reign]] training camp opens with a 25-person roster\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.664147713Z","tags":null},"/Day-15-Primer-The-Finale-+-Roster-Moves":{"title":"Day 15 Primer – The Finale + Roster Moves","content":"\n# Day 15 Primer – The Finale + Roster Moves\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-07 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [Day 15 Primer – The Finale + Roster Moves](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/07/day-15-primer-the-finale-roster-moves/)\n2022-10-07 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[Day 15 Primer – The Finale + Roster Moves]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n## Players\n- \n\n## Summary\n\u003eConsider today to be the final day of camp, Insiders. \n\u003e \\[...]  The next time the Kings practice, the friendly confines of camp are behind us and the real deal is upon us.\n\n## Notes\n- [[Lias Andersson]] passed through waivers and was assigned to the [[Ontario Reign]].\n- Assigned to the [[Ontario Reign]]:\n\t- [[Samuel Fagemo]]\n\t- [[T.J.

Group B consisted of five lines and nine defensemen, all of whom are players who are expected to at the very least compete for a full-time roster spot.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e Cal received treatments today, we don’t think it’s anything serious but it’s obviously something we don’t want to fool around with, he would be day-to-day. We’re not anticipating a long injury, but who knows….Durzi is getting close to joining our group, I assume, and he’s starting to extend his rehab into more contact. Arvidsson is doing really well, still some time and Turcotte is working hard to get back, he’s feeling better. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e I want to play every game, that’s my goal for this year,” he said earlier today. “That’s the goal at least, to prove that I can play in every game. Playing in the playoffs was a great experience and I’ll take a lot of that confidence with me into this season.\n\n\u003e In my mind, he has grown every year. There was a time really early, maybe three or four years ago, where I think he was very confident but maybe didn’t have all the tools yet to display that. Then, it’s hard to get it back sometimes. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e I think he’s gotten better every year, he’s shown that he’s very capable of playing in high pressure situations, in playoffs last year. Even leading up to that, yeah he wasn’t in the lineup for a couple of nights but there were other reasons for that. We think he can be a full-time player and be an effective full-time player. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.664147713Z","tags":null},"/Day-6-Primer-+-The-Differences-Between-Playing-Center-and-Playing-Winger":{"title":"Day 6 Primer + The Differences Between Playing Center and Playing Winger","content":"\n# Day 6 Primer + The Differences Between Playing Center and Playing Winger\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-09-27 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [Day 6 Primer + The Differences Between Playing Center and Playing Winger](http://lakingsinsider.com/2022/09/27/day-6-primer-the-differences-between-playing-center-playing-winger/)\n2022-09-27 | [[LA Kings Insider]] |  [[Day 6 Primer + The Differences Between Playing Center and Playing Winger]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Jaret Anderson-Dolan]]\n- [[Lias Andersson]]\n- [[Rasmus Kupari]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Akil Thomas]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Following games on the road, on consecutive days, including travel back to Los Angeles last night after the win over Vegas, today’s skates are a bit delayed on start time. Group A is set to kick things off at 11:30 AM, rather than the usual 10:00 AM start time here in El Segundo.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e Definitely the defensive zone. Often times, you’re ending up low when you’re the center men, but with the way we play, if you’re the first guy back in the zone you end up being the low guy. It’s a little bit of both. I would say it’s just different thinking, a centerman is a little but more strategic, knowing where everyone is and as a winger, you’re kind of just marking your d-man and staying with him. It’s different but like I said, I’m feeling more and more comfortable with being on the wing, so I’m looking forward to seeing where I’ll be and definitely comfortable either way. -- [[Jaret Anderson-Dolan]]\n\n\u003e Wherever they want me. I played when I played center growing up, but these past two years with the Kings, I’ve been both, so I’m comfortable being a winger now. It’s actually a big difference, but I think it’s good to be able to play both positions. Center is more like stay down low, you win battles and winger is more like board work, blocking some shots from the point and it’s just details, but I think I got used to it pretty well, but you can always be better. -- [[Lias Andersson]]\n\n\u003e No \\[preference] really, I can play both. I’m probably normally a center, but it doesn’t really matter, I can play as a wing too. Last year, I played some good games on the wing and wherever the coaches put me, I’ll be ready. In our system, whoever winds up being the first forwards down low takes that center spot for a while anyways. Yeah, there’s a hug difference if you’re the low forward or the winger, you kind of have more resposibility when you’re down low. Doesn’t really matter to me though, whether I’m center or wing, I can play both. -- [[Rasmus Kupari]]\n\n\u003e The biggest differences are in the d-zone. I feel like it’s more stops and starts versus standing still and reading the play. As a winger, it’s making sure you’ve got your defenseman, so there are subtle differences, but in the o-zone, it doesn’t really matter. I’ve got to continue to work on \\[the defensive zone], you can always get better with your wall play and that’s important for me when playing as a winger, taking care of my own zone first. I feel like once I get in the o-zone I can create. -- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.664147713Z","tags":null},"/Day-9-Primer-Todays-Groups-+-Arvidsson-and-Durzi-with-main-group-Wagner-clears-waivers":{"title":"Day 9 Primer – Today’s Groups + Arvidsson and Durzi with main group, Wagner clears waivers","content":"\n# Day 9 Primer – Today’s Groups + Arvidsson and Durzi with main group, Wagner clears waivers\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-09-30 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [Day 9 Primer – Today’s Groups + Arvidsson and Durzi with main group, Wagner clears waivers](http://lakingsinsider.com/2022/09/30/day-9-primer-todays-groups-arvidsson-durzi-with-main-group-wagner-assigned-to-ont/)\n2022-09-30 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[Day 9 Primer – Today’s Groups + Arvidsson and Durzi with main group, Wagner clears waivers]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n- [[Sean Durzi]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings are back on the ice this morning coming out of yesterday’s day off.

So, not only are we expecting that, that we know he can accomplish it, but the leadership part that comes with it. When you get into tight situations or you get into an overtime situation and you’re relying on a big player to step up, he’s now at that level for us. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e It’s different, certainly. A guy like that, you can obviously never replace. To be in this room for 18 straight years and 16 straight years that I was sitting next to him, it’s tough. But there are opportunities for the other guys to evolve, and those are big shoes to fill. But they do evolve and try to fill at least a little bit. -- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\n\u003e He’s been in the organization for a long time. We saw glimpses of that – at times there may have been 10 or 15 games stretches \\[he was good], and there would be some stretches where it wasn’t \\[as good]. The more complete player has come out of him throughout the years, and the fit within the lineup \\[is good] now, too. -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\u003e To me, where Adrian \\[was] the day I walked in the door and where Adrian is now, he’s gone from boy to man, in my opinion, and his responsibility for his own game has gone up immensely. And I see that in him. So, I have confidence that he can carry on. Is he a 35 goal scorer? I sure hope so. But I know he’s a 20 minute player for sure most nights, and that’s just as important as being a 35 goal scorer. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.664147713Z","tags":null},"/Drew-Doughty":{"title":"Drew Doughty","content":"\n# Drew Doughty\n\nNHL.com / Ontario Reign | Twitter\n-|-\n[Drew Doughty](https://www.nhl.com/player/drew-doughty-8474563) | [@dewyy8](https://twitter.com/dewyy8)\n\nPlayer | \\# | Position | Shoots | Height | Weight | Born | Birthplace | Draft \n-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-\nDrew Doughty | 8 | RD | R | 6' 1\" | 210 | 1989-12-08 | London, ON, CAN | 2008 LAK, 1st rd, 2nd pk (2nd overall)\n\n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date       | Site                 | Title                                     |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[Kings at NHL.com]] | [[Kings score seven, hold off late rally by Wild for first win of season]]                                                                                 |\n| 2022-10-14 | [[The Athletic]] | [[Duhatschek - Nazem Kadri Flames observations, the Kraken’s improvements, the Kings struggle]]\n| 2022-10-14 | [[The Athletic]] | [[Brandt Clarkes NHL debut - Shift-by-shift analysis of the LA Kings rookie]]\n| 2022-10-12 | [[The Forum Report]] | [[Possession Chart - October 11 vs VGK]]\n| 2022-10-11 | [[Hockey Royalty]] | [[Week 1 Pacific Division Power Rankings]]\n| 2022-10-10 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[On the eve of the 2022-23 season, Kings leadership expecting progress from increased expectations - LA Kings Insider]]\n| 2022-10-10 | [[LA Times]] | [[Five things to watch for as LA Kings embark on new NHL season - Los Angeles Times]]\n| 2022-10-08 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[10-8 Preview – Gameday Thoughts + Byfield Update, Net Play, Versatility At The Bottom]]\n| 2022-10-03 | [[LA Times]] | [[Younger Kings players must beat Anze Kopitar for scoring title - Los Angeles Times]]\n| 2022-09-28 | [[LA Kings Insider]] |  [[PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 1, Sharks 3 – Doughty, Villalta, McLellan]]\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\nDate | Site |  Title\n---|---|---\n\n\n\n## Post-Draft Coverage\nDate | Site |  Title\n---|---|---\n\n\n\n## Pre-Draft Coverage\nDate | Site |  Title\n---|---|---\n\n\n## Unprocessed Coverage\n- \n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.664147713Z","tags":null},"/Duhatschek-Nazem-Kadri-Flames-observations-the-Krakens-improvements-the-Kings-struggle":{"title":"Duhatschek - Nazem Kadri Flames observations, the Kraken’s improvements, the Kings struggle","content":"\n# Duhatschek - Nazem Kadri Flames observations, the Kraken’s improvements, the Kings struggle\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-14 | [[The Athletic]] | [Duhatschek - Nazem Kadri Flames observations, the Kraken’s improvements, the Kings struggle](https://theathletic.com/3693892/2022/10/14/nazem-kadri-flames-duhatschek-notebook/#:~:text=Kings%20struggle%20out%20of%20the%20gate)\n2022-10-14 | [[The Athletic]] | [[Duhatschek - Nazem Kadri Flames observations, the Kraken’s improvements, the Kings struggle]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Eric Duhatschek]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Drew Doughty]]\n- [[Cal Petersen]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e \n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.664147713Z","tags":null},"/FINAL-Kings-1-Kraken-4-Clarke-Danault-McLellan-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"FINAL - Kings 1, Kraken 4 - Clarke, Danault, McLellan - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# FINAL - Kings 1, Kraken 4 - Clarke, Danault, McLellan - LA Kings Insider\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-13 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [FINAL - Kings 1, Kraken 4 - Clarke, Danault, McLellan - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/13/final-kings-1-kraken-4-clarke-danault-mclellan/)\n2022-10-13 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[FINAL - Kings 1, Kraken 4 - Clarke, Danault, McLellan - LA Kings Insider]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n- [[Phillip Danault]]\n\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings were unable to even their record on a season-opening, two-game homestand, with a 4-1 defeat against the Seattle Kraken.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Phillip Danault]]\n\u003e We have some work to do. We’re not playing a full 60 minutes, we’re sloppy with passes and the details and we have to capitalize as well. It’s not that we’re not trying, we tried really hard today, but it’s not enough. We’ve got to start better.\n\n\u003e Obviously you want to get a win, get going and it’s not even just about winning, it’s about the team game. I don’t think we’re on point at all, we aren’t moving fast enough, or playing the way we should be.\n\n\u003e It’s all around, it’s not somebody in particular, everyone has to step up their game. We have to pack our bags, go on the road and go into the war zone. We’ve got to get a win going and get back on track.\n\n\u003e Yeah, definitely. I think this is going to be good for our team. We have a couple of new guys here, so this is going to be much needed.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e We played much better defensively than we did in game one. We kept a heavy, hard team to 16 shots on goal at even strength. Our penalty kill did a really good job in a lot of situations, I know we gave up a goal, but the 5-on-3 was real positive. You know, there are some things that we have to take from that game and look at it positively. The negative side, we’re a minute and a half in and we have a too many men on the ice penalty. Game management. Three o-zone penalties tonight, game management. It’s something we’ve been harping and harping on and those are essentially impossible situations to practice, so they’ve got to take care of it.\n\n\u003e Little bit of both. They’re a scrappy team, they get in the way a lot, heavy, hard sticks, a lot of battles, a lot of crap coming out of the out of the bottles. There’s rarely anything clean when you play against them and when you do have the opportunity, I think we created more in the game, believe it or not, than what showed up on the scoreboard. The simple fact is, we didn’t want to shoot the puck, we wanted to be over-creative. I think of 2-on-1’s, I think of 3-on-1’s, I think we had almost a 4-on-1 and we didn’t get any shots off. It’s just too cute. When we’re playing well, I think you could kind of feel it in the third, we started to put some pressure on, we shot the puck, we got it back and got them out of position but a little too cute right now. We’re still trying to figure out who we are.\n\n\u003e I think the answer to both of those is yes. Reflective of the score and not liking what we’re seeing there, combinations of players were a little bit flat, there wasn’t a lot going on. We haven’t shuffled the deck a lot, potentially could wake the group up a little bit by shuffling it and trying to find maybe a combination that that gave us more life.\n\n\u003e You know, we dressed six defenseman tonight, I know he wasn’t six, pretty sure he wasn’t five and I don’t believe he was four either. So, that’s what I thought of him, I thought he had a real good night. He didn’t hurt us at all defensively, creative offensively. I’d like to see him shoot the puck a little bit because I think he’s got a great shot and he loves to pass but he had some real good looks at the net where he could have shot the puck.\n\n\u003e Well, it’s a losing streak to start the season already, because we’re at two and we haven’t put one on the board yet, but it is early. As I said, we’re trying to figure out who we are, how do we want to play the game? For the media that was there this morning or yesterday, it doesn’t happen automatically, you get to recreate yourself every year. The reference point that we had after game one was last year, now we have six periods in the bag and much better defensively today. Gave up far fewer opportunities than we did against Vegas, but still many things to work on. We didn’t put the points in the bank, but as I mentioned earlier, there were positive things to build on.\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.664147713Z","tags":null},"/FINAL-Kings-3-Golden-Knights-4-Vilardi-Kopitar-McLellan-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"FINAL - Kings 3, Golden Knights 4 - Vilardi, Kopitar, McLellan - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# FINAL - Kings 3, Golden Knights 4 - Vilardi, Kopitar, McLellan - LA Kings Insider\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-11 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [FINAL - Kings 3, Golden Knights 4 - Vilardi, Kopitar, McLellan - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/11/final-kings-3-golden-knights-4-vilardi-kopitar-mclellan/)\n2022-10-11 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[FINAL - Kings 3, Golden Knights 4 - Vilardi, Kopitar, McLellan - LA Kings Insider]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n- [[Arthur Kaliyev]]\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings started off the regular season with a a difficult defeat, by a 4-3 final against the Vegas Golden Knights.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n- Kings Goal Scorers\n\t- [[Gabe Vilardi]] \n\t- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n\t- [[Arthur Kaliyev]]\n\n### [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\u003e It’s certainly a loss that’s tough to swallow right now, because there were a couple of goals that were clearly off of our mistakes. Positives were that we scored a power-play goal, we battled back a couple of times, especially in the third. I’m sure we’re going to look at some stuff to improve on and keep building on it.\n\n\u003e Yeah, I think so. For the most part, the d-pairings, the lines were intact throughout the preseason, not swapping around too much. There’s certainly some chemistry, but like I said, there’s always room for improvement and that’s what we’re going to do.\n\n\u003e Yeah, we’ll correct that for sure. You can chalk it up to a first game and all of that, but the bottom line is that we just can’t afford to lose a game like that, especially with the amount of mistakes that we made.\n\n\u003e A ton. He’s proven it for 15 years, so it’s certainly something that we’ve talked about before and I’m sure we’re going to talk about again moving forward.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e Well, the end result \\[was the most disappointing thing], because we were still in it at the end of the night, so losing a game that we got an outstanding effort by our goaltender and we still had a chance to win, still had a chance on point, really. Obviously the focus is going to be on the play at the end, which makes no sense, it’s hard to defend it, but our team gave up 51 shots on goal tonight. When you look at the night, the first goal against was just terrible game management, coming out of the penalty box and not being aware. The second one is at the back end of a power play, you have to rewind the video a little bit, we were on the power play and we negated it with the offensive zone penalty, so terrible game management there. Third one, an actual power-play goal and the fourth one was just stupidity. A lot of it is self-inflicted but you also have to give them credit. They put a lot of pressure on us and they created a lot of turnovers and a lot of pressure on our net, so we’ve got work to do.\n\n\u003e We’ve preached and preached about it, but sometimes you’ve got to get hit pretty hard with a 2×4 and maybe this was it. If you look at some of the penalties we’ve taken throughout exhibition season, I think I mentioned it a few times, we were penalized more away from our net than we were near our net and what I mean by that is neutral zone and offensive zone. Maybe it’s not important yet, I don’t know, but it’ll cost us eventually and it did tonight. Then, it’s simple game management things. Knowing where the puck is coming out of the penalty box on a line change you’ve got to be aware of that. Missing the net on that play. The end, a set breakout that we work on all the time, you’ve got numerous options. That is all game management, that’s getting engaged and ready to go. Their team did a better job of it than we did tonight.\n\n\u003e The camp was pretty open. We had an idea of what the roster was going to look like and then there was going to be a competition for some remaining spots, as well as spots in the lineup and on the powerplay. What he’s done is he’s come in and won ice time and he’s earned the opportunity to be in key situations and he continued to play. I thought he was one of our better players again tonight. Self satisfaction and individual growth is great and we need that from Gabe and we’re proud of him, I think he’s going to continue to do those things. As we drive home tonight, we’re not going to be too concerned about number 13.\n\n\u003e We can tell them that you just don’t turn the light switch on when the season starts but sometimes you have to live it a little bit and we mentioned it virtually every game in the preseason. Starting in San Jose, we were shorthand five times in the first period. We brought it up and we brought it up and when you’re in one-goal games, those moments cost you both offensively and defensively and it did tonight.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.664147713Z","tags":null},"/FINAL-Kings-5-Red-Wings-4-OT-Danault-Moore-Walker-McLellan-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"FINAL - Kings 5, Red Wings 4 (OT) - Danault, Moore, Walker, McLellan - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# FINAL - Kings 5, Red Wings 4 (OT) - Danault, Moore, Walker, McLellan - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-17 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [FINAL - Kings 5, Red Wings 4 (OT) - Danault, Moore, Walker, McLellan - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/17/final-kings-5-red-wings-4-ot-danault-moore-walker-mclellan/) |\n| 2022-10-17 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[FINAL - Kings 5, Red Wings 4 (OT) - Danault, Moore, Walker, McLellan - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                                  |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings came out on top following a back-and-forth game in Detroit, earning their second victory of the season with a 5-4 overtime win over the Red Wings.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Phillip Danault]]\n- [[Trevor Moore]]\n- [[Sean Walker]]\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Trevor Moore]]\n\u003e Yeah, for sure. It’s huge to have Arvy back, he’s a huge piece to our line and he brings so much offense to it. I think that was good, but I think we have to keep building in a lot of areas, myself especially win more battles and come up with more pucks and sustain pressure in the o-zone.\n\n\u003e It was kind of a weird play, I was coming for a change to get the defenseman on because we were on the power play and then the power play was ending. Everyone started yelling that the puck was right there, so I just turned it up. I just saw Phil on the back side, it was kind of a weird play.\n\n\u003e Yeah, I think that we’re doing some good stuff defensively, just still too many penalties. Putting too much weight on our penalty kill and Quickie in those spots.\n\n### [[Sean Walker]]\n\u003e Yeah, it was five minutes into warmups, I was just hanging out in the back and I heard Eds took a puck somewhere and just to be ready. I kind of started my warmups there and just got ready and got out there. Not the usual routine and everything, but I think I handled it well.\n\n\u003e Mentally, I don’t think there was very much time, it was just go out there and let the body take over. Physically, I had about five minutes to roll out and stretch quick, then it was get ready. It was definitely weird, but I think I handled it well and I was happy with how the game turned out.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e Real good effort, we’re getting better, it’s starting to feel a little bit more like how he should play. There are still moments during the game, obviously the empty netter, where we’re not quite there yet, but for the most part I thought we started to look a lot more like we should. Quickie had a good game, circumstances were strange again tonight, with Edler going down in warmups, and Walker by far had his best game of the season so far, including preseason so that’s a good sign. Good effort by everybody.\n\n\u003e Well, the players themselves, we had a lot of experience, four or five guys they settled down, everybody wanted to win it for Arvy, you saw a lot of guys going over and tapping him, saying no problem we got this. That’s how it ended, but we sure don’t want to be doing that too often, putting ourselves in that situation.\n\n\u003e The ability that upper-end players, just to make very small plays to keep a play alive or to create a chance….it was just a little touch through the neutral zone. Sometimes, our not-so-offensive players would quit on that, or they’d have already turned and they’d be backchecking, but the gifted ones are able to do that. Similar goal the other night in Minnesota with Kempe coming down and finding a hole off that wing with speed.\n\n\u003e We yelled at Sean Walker to get his equipment on, no warmup and he played, that’s all you can do. The game plan doesn’t change because one guy goes down, next man up and that’s how it happened. For me, I know Sean Walker would have to answer this question, but that may be the best way for him to go in and play. No thinking, just go play the game. His ability to come back from the injury after not having played for a long, long time, I thought tonight he did an admirable job under difficult circumstances.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.664147713Z","tags":null},"/FINAL-Kings-7-Wild-6-Fiala-Kempe-McLellan-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"FINAL - Kings 7, Wild 6 - Fiala, Kempe, McLellan - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# FINAL - Kings 7, Wild 6 - Fiala, Kempe, McLellan - LA Kings Insider\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-15 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [FINAL - Kings 7, Wild 6 - Fiala, Kempe, McLellan - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/15/final-kings-7-wild-6-fiala-kempe-mclellan/)\n2022-10-15 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[FINAL - Kings 7, Wild 6 - Fiala, Kempe, McLellan - LA Kings Insider]]\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings moved into the win column on one of the strangest nights we’ve seen in awhile, a 7-6 win over Minnesota on Saturday evening.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Adrian Kempe]]\n\u003e Yeah, offensively it was a good game for us, especially after the first couple games when we didn’t really feel like we had enough offense going, so that was a step in the right direction. On the other side of the puck, I think we still have some things we’ve got to improve, but I think we deserved the win tonight. If it was 1-0 of 7-6, it doesn’t matter right now, this was a huge first win and we got better in all three zones. Good thing and a good win for the team.\n\n\u003e Yeah, for sure, and I think we showed a lot of that in preseason. In the first couple of games, I feel like you’re trying to get back into everything, you’re a little nervous when you get out there. It felt good out there tonight, I thought both units looked good. Somethings we can keep building on.\n\n\u003e Yeah, huge, I mean that’s momentum. The way you can get that back, it’s huge. I think we invited them, including myself, too many penalties tonight, so that’s something we’ve got to improve still. PK did a good job at the end, in the third, which is huge. We’re all excited about the game.\n\n\u003e Yeah, we had some more looks, we’ve played a couple of games together now, we’re trying to figure each other out through the first couple of games. When you start to figure it out, you know where each other is on the ice. We had some good chances so far in the first three games and we got a couple of good ones tonight.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e I think if you told us we were going to score seven goals, I’d have been jumping for joy. It’s the giving up six that isn’t the ideal recipe and that’s a really hard game to explain. I’m not sure that we’re going to give six goals up and win a game again this year, so that’s the negative side of it. The positive is we found ways to score seven. Strange night, maybe that’s what we needed to get a win and find a way. Rest and get ready for Detroit.\n\n\u003e Yeah, we were, but really, there wasn’t a lot of volume both ways. The shots weren’t 50 to 49 or anything like that, it just seemed to be going in the net, didn’t matter what happened. Whether it bounced or went straight in, it was an odd night for both teams in their zones. I thought both teams did a real good job of penalty killing, yet gave up power-play goals. For a lot of years in the league, this one’s tough to explain.\n\n\u003e We saw more from our power play tonight than we did in the first two games. We had a lot of changes, we’ve got new people in new places, we’ve got some new thoughts and ideas of how it wants to work. It’s going to be a work in progress, but you can see little snippets of things that are starting to happen and that’s a positive sign. Penalty kill, again, the best penalty killer we can have is not being in the box, I think we’re short six times from the beginning of the second period on. That’s a terrible recipe for success and we’ve got to find out a way to solve that and the penalty kill can do a better job.\n\n\u003e Important, very important, especially on the road. You can feel the momentum starting to go their way and to come back and have your key players execute and score in those situations is important. Just when the opposition is creeping back into the game and they get nailed with another one, that can do wonders for us. It buys us time to regroup and get our legs underneath us again.\n\n\u003e I would say that, I would say probably both teams were thinking the same thing. Get us the save and we’ll get you a goal. Obviously that was the way the night was going and we did give up six, I’m not sure that we can pin them all on Cal Petersen. So, what’s important for him is he got a win, he’s got some confidence as far as winning goes, and the team got that, but it’s pretty evident we have to clean some things up.","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.664147713Z","tags":null},"/Fial-ing-Right-At-Home-Film-Analysis-and-Quotes-from-a-successful-Minnesota-return-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"Fial-ing Right At Home - Film, Analysis and Quotes from a successful Minnesota return - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# Fial-ing Right At Home - Film, Analysis and Quotes from a successful Minnesota return - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [Fial-ing Right At Home - Film, Analysis and Quotes from a successful Minnesota return - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/16/fial-ing-right-at-home-film-analysis-quotes-from-a-successful-minnesota-return/) |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[Fial-ing Right At Home - Film, Analysis and Quotes from a successful Minnesota return - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                                                      |\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Whether it was extra motivation, the circumstances of the evening, or perhaps just a good plan coming together as intended, Kevin Fiala made the most of his homecoming yesterday in Minnesota. With a goal and two assists in the 7-6 victory, Fiala contributed offensively, in an arena he knows all too well. Fiala had 43 points from 41 games played at Xcel Energy Center last season, with his team winning 31 of those 41 games.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\nAnalysis of key plays by [[Kevin Fiala]] in his first game back against Minnesota.\n\n\u003e We saw that for sure, the PP is supposed to score goals and obviously it doesn’t always work, but tonight we moved the puck quickly and everything was fast. We shot it, we retrieved it, we passed it, everything was quick and I think that’s why we were successful. -- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n\u003e On the ice, it always takes a little while for new players to adapt to a new system, new teammates, new language from the coaching staff, but you can that the talent is there. He’s got a real good skill level and I don’t think we’ve seen the best of Kevin yet and that will come out later on. We’re happy to have him, he’s a really good addition. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e Much better tonight. Sometimes, on the road, you don’t think about it, you just play the game. When you’re not at home, sometimes you’re more of the underdog and maybe that was what helped today was that we just played the game, we didn’t think it. A good step, but we have to keep going. -- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.664147713Z","tags":null},"/Fiala-Talks-Return-Analytical-Winners-Kopitar-Passes-Taylor-and-other-LA-Kings-Bullets":{"title":"Fiala Talks Return, Analytical Winners, Kopitar Passes Taylor, and other LA Kings Bullets","content":"\n# Fiala Talks Return, Analytical Winners, Kopitar Passes Taylor, and other LA Kings Bullets\n\n| Date       | Site               | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[Hockey Royalty]] | [Fiala Talks Return, Analytical Winners, Kopitar Passes Taylor, and other LA Kings Bullets](https://hockeyroyalty.com/2022/10/16/fiala-talks-return-analytical-winners-kopitar-passes-taylor-and-other-la-kings-bullets/) |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[Hockey Royalty]] | [[Fiala Talks Return, Analytical Winners, Kopitar Passes Taylor, and other LA Kings Bullets]]                                                                                                                             |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Ryan Sikes]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Cal Petersen]]\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Saturday marked Kevin Fiala‘s first game at the Xcel Energy Center since he was traded from Minnesota to the LA Kings over the summer. He tallied three points (1G, 2A) in the game. He was also honored with a video tribute\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e It was really nice being here, and I appreciate all the support from the fans. It was a great moment for me, and I enjoyed it.\n\u003e \n\u003e I felt pretty good and obviously you know a little more motivated playing against my old team but it was good.

They battled back every time \\[Minnesota] put us on our heels and it’s not very often the last couple years that we’ve been able to trade goals when we’ve needed them, and this was a night we needed to find some goals, and we found them. A lot of credit goes to the guys. That’s obviously not the way I think we want to be winning these games, but hey … sometimes throughout the season some games are going to call for that. -- [[Cal Petersen]]\n\n\u003e There wasn’t a lot of volume both ways.

Blake speaks to the media before the 2022-23 Regular Season\n\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e Q: Brandt Clarke's on the roster, 19 \n\u003e years old, could you talk about the\n\u003e thought process as he starts the year \n\u003e with starting the year with a kid that\n\u003e young\n\u003e \n\u003e A: yeah I think we we have some experience\nin on our staff I think [[Trent Yawney]]'s\ndone a terrific job with some young D in\nthe different organizations he's been in\nso we've relied on his help on that uh\n[[Jim Hiller]] went through the situation\nwith a young guy and the Islanders a\ncouple years ago so basically comes down\nto making sure when he does get in the\nlineup he's going to get the right\namount of minutes to to keep developing\nI think his play through rookie camp and\ntraining camp uh put him to a level\nwhere where we want to see him in the\nNHL and and that kind of went into the\ndecision process and uh but but now the\nstep is to make sure that it keeps going\nthat way and we'll let that play out\nhere the the first little while and and\nprobably have to reevaluate again\n\n\u003e Q: Rob, following off of that what is it\n\u003e that you saw in his game and you broke it\n\u003e down where you felt comfortable\n\u003e have him start here \n\u003e \n\u003e A: I think he can\nplay in all situations use him a lot on\npenalty kill\num which which can give you an\nopportunity to get the minutes needed to\nkeep developing at the NHL level uh\nPower Play obviously you see that you\nsee the deception and and uh his hockey\nIQ and that but also defending you know\na good in his sense and his defending\nand that he's going to have to learn to\nprotect himself a little bit more guys\nare bigger and stronger at this level\nthan Junior but I think the all-around\ngame there's a lot of aspects that that\nwould allow a player when he does get in\nthe lineup in the regular season to\nmaintain those minutes that are going to\nhelp progress\n\n\u003e Q: Lot of depth on the right side in th\n\u003e lineup does that kind of allow you to ease\nhim in and you know is there a drive\nfrom that group you like seeing on the\nleft side yeah\n\u003e \n\u003e A: well we've tried quite a few over there\nyou know [[Sean Walker]]'s played there at\ntimes I think we got to get them\ncomfortable coming back from knee\nsurgery before we experiment again with\nthe left side uh [[Sean Durzi]] saw the last\ngame slide over there and and made that\ntransition really easy and we've used\nBrandt Clark a couple times over there so\nthe availability to open up that left\nside within our defense can can increase\nthe getting Brandt in the lineup getting\nthe minutes he needs\n\n\u003e Q: Rob, five and a half\nyears\nyeah can you confirm any speculation\nabout contract extension for yourself\n\u003e\n\u003e A: well it was done basically done last\nyear and during the summer there was\nnever really an official announcement\njust because we didn't feel we needed to\non that aspect\num but yeah that was that was taken\ncare of their uh probably\nI would say just immediately after the\nseason was over\n\n\u003e Q: And short of winning the Cup\n\u003e what does succeess mean to you \nat this time\n\u003e \n\u003e A: progress again continued progress I\nmean we made a big step getting back in\nthe playoffs now you've got to hold that\nlevel and keep getting into and but I\nthink the roster starts to take a little\nmore shape you know you had a few pieces\nto free agency you give the young guys a\ncouple more years to get up and running\nat the NHL level now you put the\nemphasis on them producing and helping\nus keep winning\n\n\u003e Q: Rob, it's hard and Todd said it right off the\nbat and it and I think some of the group\nhave talked about it you know the\nword expectations what's worried\nIs that something where you feel like now\nthe club is at that point to embrace the\nheightening expectations\n\u003e\n\u003e A: I I think so and with\nexpectations there comes a lot that goes\nwith it I think we really have to Define\nwithin our interior walls what what we\nexpect out of this group and and to that\nyou know just building and getting\nbetter every time we're on the ice we got to\nget better we got to get our special\nteams better we need a lot of areas of\nour game need to increase uh you know\nfrom a year ago to keep that level but\nbut those expectations and we've talked\nto the players and everything it's from\nwithin we we Define that on a personal\nlevel and as a team level and and their\nexpectations that we we we want these\nguys to meet\n\n\u003e Q: On special teams, [[Jim Hiller]] has joined\n\u003e the staff power plays look a little bit different\nso far what did you like about him when\nhe brought him in and what he's kind of\ndone with that so far.\n\u003e \n\u003e A: yeah that and Todd had a big say in that\nobviously uh he wanted experience in\nfilling that role when that when that\nrole became open he he definitely wanted\nexperience just because of the the\nAvenue that he felt our team was at and\nthat he wanted to put that right into it\num I think on the power play you know\nit's another year of of adding a couple\ndifferent younger players into that uh\nequation however we roll out you know\none or two units and then the addition\nof fiala gives you a different look on\nthat so you can see a little bit\ndifferent movement on our power play\nthan we've had in the past\n\n\u003e Q: How long did it take you to process the\n\u003e game 7 loss that was a tough situation to be\n\u003e so up and down. for you personally\n\u003e through the summer, how long did it take\n\u003e you to process it\n\u003e\n\u003e A: um I I think it was more of a building\nprocess of oh okay we not only got in\nthe playoffs but you pushed the team\npretty far and we had an opportunity at\nhome here to to get things that we\nunfortunately didn't take that next step\nbut I I do think it exposed a lot of our\nyounger players due to injury to to a\nreal heightened level of play and also\nin a market that you know was striving\nfor the playoffs there and and so\neverything around it you just take that\nand continue to build on it\n\n\u003e Q: Rob when you look at Fiala now that\n\u003e you get a chance to watch him day in\n\u003e and day out anything kind of catch you\n\u003e off guard and how do you assess how \n\u003e he's fit in\n\u003e  \n\u003e A: Puck protection probably number one\nright uh the the ability to protect in\ntight tight areas he's got real real\ngood hockey Vision there and an IQ and\nmaking plays in that but he battles to\nprotect pucks and he gives us an element\nthat I'm not sure we had a whole bunch\nin this organization he's he's a natural\nscorer a lot of high-end offense and and\nvery creative in in the types of plays\nhe wants to make uh you know probably\nfrom the red line in\n\n\n\u003e Q:  last season\nyou've got career highs from Kempe\nyou had Danault show a new dimension to\nhis game\nis there any sense in your Roundup was\nthat a fluke or is that the beginning of\nsomething new I mean how do you judge\nthat how do you look at that\n\u003e\n\u003e A: um well I I\nsee progress in those guys games I'll\nspeak I guess first on Kempe he's been\nin the organization for a long time we\nsaw glimpses of that you know at the\ntimes they they may have been 10 or 15\ngame stretches and there would be some\nstretches where it wasn't so you know\nthe more complete uh player I I think\nhas come out of him throughout the years\nand and and the fit within the lineup\nnow too\num you know with Phil I think our you\nknow when we acquired them it was you\nknow we knew we were getting a good\nplayer we weren't sure at that level of\noffense and and now\num he seems to find a real good\ncompliment with [[Trevor Moore]] and [[Viktor Arvidsson|Avridsson]]\nand in the way they play uh down low and\neverything but yeah we definitely have a\na you know an expectation of Phil that\nthat now increases offensively\num but I think a lot of it surrounds\naround his leadership I felt that he\nadded a big touch to that but but you\nknow that was created excitement that\nsome of those players bought in and now\nwe have to get that out of Kevin Fiala\nwe have to get it out of some of our\nyoung guys that are are going to take a\nlittle bit more prominent roles on the\nteam\n\n\u003e Q: Rob, on Fiala, we know that Minnesota\n\u003e had some cap difficulties obviously\nbut when did you first kind of Target\nhim kind of really had him in mind as as\na possibility \n\u003e\n\u003e A: yeah it's a little\ndifferent situation a lot of times you\nknow as you prepare for free agency\nyou're Gathering lists of of players\nthat you know are free agents and and\nyou know contract wise and understand\nthat first of all you had to I guess\nfind the uh the need for that type of\nplayer within our lineup and what it\nwould do but then there's also players\nthat names come about just because of\ncertain situations where their teams not\nnecessarily free agents and now now you\nhave to go and try to acquire it so\nthere was a process leading up to it\nthat that all teams do you speak to all\nteams and understand kind of players\navailable but it fit a specific need we\nwere looking for that we may have had to\naddress in free agency but were able to\ndo it beforehand just because of the\nsituation \n\n\u003e Q: how quickly does the deal come together\n\u003e \n\u003e A: uh it was probably a well it it's a\nlonger process in the car in the in the\num the talks and everything this one was\na little bit different in uh the\nopportunity to to have to you know get a\ncontract in place for the player and\nthat but as far as the real negotiations\nthere's a four or five day window where\nyou go back and forth um when you know\nboth teams are actually serious about\ntrying to get a deal done some sometimes\nthere's a lot of process beforehand that\ntakes place but when when you understand\nboth sides want to get the same thing\naccomplished then then you go to work\n\n\u003e Q: Rob, what do you do with all the right handed\n\u003e defensemen now. \n\u003e \n\u003e A: well yeah no it's uh it's a unique\nsituation I'm not sure we see it too\noften in the league you see a lot of\nlefties over righties like I said I\nthink Trent's been good at experimenting\nor or or trying like with with the\nDurzi and the Walker and Clarke and uh\nthese are good players that I don't I\ndon't feel\na necessary worried about having to put\na guy on the left side it's just the way\nour makeup is on our team\num you know with some of the injuries\nlast year to Walker to Doughty to Roy we\nhad to put some guys in the lineup early\nwith Durzi and and he took advantage of\nthat and Jordan Spence they just happen\nto be all be righties\n\n\u003e Q: Talking about Spence, is it tough to\n\u003e have the conversation with him? \n\u003e\n\u003e A:  yeah he's a very good player\nyep I had to have that with him with\n[[Rasmus Kupari]] with [[Jacob Moverare]] you know\na number of players there\num I still think those players can learn\nin the American League I I think a\nplayer eventually if he's good enough\nand he's an everyday NHL player there'll\ncome a point when he's not going to\nlearn a lot more in the American League\nI I still think we can get some uh\nthings accomplished out of these players\nand that was our message was you did a\nterrific job you've done everything\nwe've asked you to do so far we still\nthink you can get better and we're gonna\nwe're gonna need you down the stretch\n\n\u003e Q: how do you evaluate [[Quinton Byfield]]'s preseason\n\u003e what are you looking for we're getting the information\n\u003e that he's alright.\n\u003e\n\u003e A: well I I think he is I I you know\nunfortunately we had a little setback\nduring training camp here with with an\nillness there that kept him out a week\nand a half and probably took uh I think\nwe had scheduled maybe five preseason\ngames and he ended up not getting\ngetting that we would hope so uh I liked\nyou know both Todd and I talked about\nhis last preseason game the the fit with\nthat line just where he sits in the\nlineup is what we're excited about and\nallowing them to kind of become the\nplayer he's had he's had a tough injury\na year ago that set him back but both\ntimes he's come into Camp ready to go\nand and look to us like he could earn\nthat spot and uh he'll get his chance\nthere now\n\n\u003e Q: What about [[Cal Petersen]] and your\n\u003e concerns if any about him\n\u003e \n\u003e A: yeah no we you know I think he can be\nbetter than he was in preseason and he\nknows that he had a period where he had\nan injury there in Vegas and had to come\nout of the lineup for a little bit and\nthen get put back into a couple games\num you know in in those situations near\nthe end of Camp we're we're trying to\nget both goalies ready for camp and and\nwe know we had specific games in that I\nthink their situation both Jonathan\nQuick and Cal is the exact same as it\nwas last year they're going to battle\neach other for those starts but but in\nturn that's going to help our team\n\n\n\u003e Q: Rob, how do you forecast the Pacific\nthis year\nyou know lost to Edmonton wound up getting where\nthey were in transition\n\u003e\n\u003e A: they're they're good teams they're all\ngood teams and then I don't think you\nknow that\nthat part of the equation it works\nitself out and everything we understand\nwe're going to be in a battle to get in\njust like we were last year we want to\nbe a little more consistent\num you know as especially on the Special\nTeams both penalty kill and power play\nthroughout but just the dictate the\nstyle of play that we want early on in\nthe season too\n\n\u003e Q: Kempe's always seemed to have a great\n\u003e work ethic, constitution.\num has he's now become a veteran like how\nhow is his leadership vocal Drive how is\nthat playing out\n\u003e\n\u003e A: it takes more a prominent role I think\nwe saw that a little bit last year\ncoming out with them\num\nuh more so just in the everyday game or\nthe everyday approach like I said I\nthink his biggest accomplishment last\nyear was his consistency right from day\none and and obviously scored a A large\nnumber of goals but but that transfers\nover to okay we we need that again outta\nyou. so so not only are we expecting\nthat we know we can accomplish it but\nbut the leadership part that comes with\nit and when you get into tight\nsituations or you get into an overtime\nsituation and you're relying on a big\nplayer to step up he's now at that level\nfor us\n\n\u003e Q: What factors went into the decision\n\u003e to go with 7 D as opposed to 8 D\n\u003e \n\u003e A: oh\nwell Lots I I think the way you look at\nit if you're in our 12 or our starting six\nwhich we would project upstairs\nregardless of your situation in the CBA\nway realize you're we're making a spot\nright now you have the ability to carry\nuh three extra players whether it's two\nforwards or a d then we we have to look a\nlittle bit at the waivers and and\nunderstand that we want to protect some\nof the assets and the players and\nthere's a few players that didn't need\nwaivers to go down but we also felt that\nthey can still build their game down\nthere so um and we all know I mean knock\non wood today is as healthy as we've\nbeen in in a full year I think we got\nback to it on Sunday we saw every player\nback we know we're going to deal with\ninjuries and we're going to need some\nadded depth down there that can come in\nand play\n\n\u003e Q: What strides have you seen from \n\u003e Gabe Villardi in preseason after the time\n\u003e he had last year\n\u003e \n\u003e A: well I I think he had a real good\npreseason last year and uh he's playing\nalongside I think [[Lias Andersson|Lias]] and Quentin and\nboth those two ran into injuries and uh\nyou know his first four or five games\nprobably wasn't the start after coming\noff that camp he continued to build um\nyou saw him in a slightly different role\nthis year I think on the Special Teams a\nlittle net front which which kind of\nfits his characteristics he's got uh\nreal good size protects the puck well got\ngood vision and everything and in good\nhand-eye would move in plays so I think he\ncan compliment our special teams and he\nwas having some success in the uh\npreseason with that now we've got to\nbuild off that but uh but yeah I know he\ncame in and uh and he was one of the\nplayers that um you know when I said we\ngot 12 and you're looking for two or\nthree extras in there he was able to\nseparate himself from a group because of\nthe way he played\n\n\u003e Q: what's the status of [[Alex Turcotte]]\n\u003e \n\u003e A: uh turk he obviously dealing with a\nconcussion injury that uh that he\nsustained at the end of last year\num and was on track doing well in the\nsummer but then had a setback during the\nsummer in summer hockey so we're dealing\nwith that uh he's currently in uh in a\nstage of his rehab where he's skating on\nhis own\num you know progressing from that point\nuh we have some medical appointments\nnext week for him if everything goes as\nplanned and in the way it's corrected uh\nhe'll soon start working his way back\ninto a non-contact spot in practice and\nwe'll go from there but it uh it's it's\na difficult situation for him and and\nfor us but we we have to put the health\nof him first I know we want him to do\nall this and everything but he has to be\nhealthy with himself in in that\nsituation before he can get back into a\npractice\n\n\u003e Q: Rob is it more difficult to make the jump\n\u003e from non-contending team to playoff team than go from playoff team\nto like serious Stanley Cup Contender now\nbecause you're not going to sneak up on\nanybody \n\u003e \n\u003e A: yeah we're not sneaking up on it\num yeah I would I would say it's tougher\nonce you once you become a playoff team\nto be able to become a real Contender\nyeah because it's because now you're\ndealing with really really good teams\nyou know the ones that get in I I think\nlike I said we made a step last year but\nnow now we have to make sure we're we're\ntaking the ability to move past that and\nand keep that going so\num yeah I think Todd used the words not\nsneaking up on anybody no not anymore\nlike but but I I think our coaching\nstaff will have our players prepared for\nthat\n\n\u003e Q: heading into the season how\nclose is the club to what your ideal\nversion of the club would be \n\u003e \n\u003e A: it's\ngetting there it's getting there I think\nthere's less and less\nconcerns through a lineup I think there\nstill are at different times in that and\nthere will be as the season goes on but\nI I do think we have players that can\nfill some certain roles and we do have\nsome depth in the right positions if\nneeded you know that that was a major\nFactor last year that I'm not sure we\nhad\nset and understood well enough with\nmajor injuries that some of these guys\nwere able to step in and play those\nminutes and and now we I think we're in\nthat same situation now we know that \n\n\u003e Q: do you feel like you're situated today\ndo you feel like your strategy for\nrunning the club over the last few\nseasons has put you in a position of\nstrength that you are glad you did \nthat \n\u003e \n\u003e A: yeah I think we're in a spot where\nwe continue to build on it you know the\nroster is starting to take that shape\num you know the you know we've talked a\nlot about younger players the last few\nyears  but now they're getting\nthey're getting some of the games in\nthey're getting uh you know whether \nit's time in the American League or\nvaluable time in the playoffs to to\nbecome not only players in our lineup\nbut help us start winning\n\n\u003e Q: Rob bit of a big picture that we're seeing here but now\nyou're obviously more tighter against\nthe cap than whatsoever how do you just\nlook at in terms of managing the cap\nover the season and maintaining the kind\nof flexibility that you want to be able\nto have if and when in-season moves or...\n\u003e \n\u003e A: yeah\nyeah well it's a day-to-day basis\n[[Jake Goldberg]] runs a lot of that on our\nyou know or in the back room here and he\nprovides an update on every day and and\nand where we are at the cap the type of\nsavings depending on which players\num within your 23 or even if you're\ncarrying a little bit less to save here\nand there that all comes into Factor uh\nany deals you're looking at any\npotential deals and everything once\nyou're up against the cap or very close\nto it you have to take all that into\nconsideration \n\n\u003e Q: what was that the plan\nespecially after obviously adding Kevin\nsigning Adrian whatsoever but you knew going\ninto this year okay we're going to be at\nthis spot we're going to be tighter and\n\u003e \n\u003e A: yep no and it's it's constant planning\nnot not only for tomorrow or the next\nday or month but for a year past year\nyou know and then\num but but all teams are have those\nrestrictions and deal within that\n\n\u003e Q: Rob you mentioned about your contract with us\nwhat about Todd \n\u003e\n\u003e A: yep yes he's got a year\nleft yes\n\u003e\n\u003e Q: one year?\n\u003e  \n\u003e A: yep yep uh well this year and next year\nyes yes sorry\n\u003e\n\u003e Q: Any movement for any kind of extension\n\u003e that far?\n\u003e \n\u003e A: no I don't think we would get into that\nright now you know I'm sure that that\nconversation takes place at the end of\nnext year like once it went to Seasons\nbut\num you know most of our coaching staff\nall of our coaching staff is pretty much\nequal in that situation too so\n\n\u003e Q: In past seasons you had players claimed\n\u003e off waivers from the LA Kings. This season is\n\u003e  there any time or thought spent paying \nattention to other teams rosters \nwhen making your decision about when to expose \n\u003e \n\u003e A: um yeah you know we go over that\nconstantly if if we\nif we're in a healthy situation we have\nplayers that that may have to be exposed\nin waivers when do you when you put them\non and when don't you and I mean there's\ntwo  thoughts you put them on early but\nthen the team can claim them and look at\nthem you put them on later that still\nallows the team to have injuries most of\nour situations was we wanted to get\nthrough our camp make sure we're healthy\ncoming into Sunday uh yesterday sit down\ndiscuss the lineup players that were\nwaiver eligible and weren't and then go\nforward from there you know losing\nplayers on waivers is it's part of the\nprocess I think we have to understand\nthat and and when you start getting\nbetter and you have more quality players\nyou'll be in those situations\n\n\u003e all right everyone thanks\n\n## Editorial Comment\n- At 12:43, Blake is asked about the decision to go with 7 defnsemen instead of 8.

practice\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e Q: A few days ago, Todd, you talked about how last\nseason's Camp was about establishing the\nidentity and this year it's more about\nrediscovering from what you guys had\nlast year how have you seen that kind of\nprogress through the last preseason game\nand to now today's Final practice? \n\u003e\n\u003e A: well I think that's a process that's\ngoing to continue not just for the Kings\nbut for for every team that's beginning\nthe season you're never the finished\nproduct on day one\nand um I do think I've mentioned to a\nfew guys that day one is often uh\nyou know it's either too high or too low\nor or whatever it is day two is really\nwhere you\num\nstart to see what your team is made of\nand and how it rolls out but\nwe're at day one it's we're going to\nmake it important it obviously is we'd\nlike to see our identity come out we'd\nlike to see our structure come out we'd\nlike to see individuals find their game\nwithin our game\nthere's areas that we've concentrated a\nlittle bit more on throughout training\ncamp\nthan others and we should see\nimprovements in those areas\nor at least\nprogression towards it pardon me\num but it will take some time and um\nwe're no different than any other team\nin the league\n\n\u003e Q: Todd you talked about identity. \n\u003e The last three games were high scoring\n\u003e games, not really your identity\n\u003e Is there a lot to clean up defensively\n\u003e or is that just an offshoot of preseason? \n\u003e \n\u003e A:  there are some things to clean up\ndefensively\num some of it's game management some of\nits\num you know situational that we've got\nindividual mistake here and there not\nnecessarily the team as a whole\nuh\nsome of its games five six and seven of\nexhibition season\nyou know whatever that means I think you\nguys can figure that out\num\nyou know we have to remember who we are\nand what our identity is and play\ntowards that so\nat the end of the day at the end of the\nday that's what will take us to where we\nwant to go and if we start to stray from\nit\nuh we'll probably learn some valuable\nlessons along the way and we'll have to\nreel some things in but that's who we\nare and that's how we'll have to play\n\n\u003e Q: you uh you took a while before you were\nable to define the identity of the team\nwhat about now what is it\n\u003e\n\u003e A: well we should be really hard to play\nagainst because we're a structured team\nwe have some predictability\num to each other not necessarily to the\nopposition in what we do uh our checking\nskills are in our DNA and we value that\nand when I say we usually starts through\nthe championship players that have been\nhere before\num and it trickles all the way down\nyou can be a really sound\nresponsible trusting\nplayer on the ice and still produce\noffense [[Phillip Danault|Phil Danault]] was that\nlast year [[Adrian Kempe]] for the most part\nis that\num so start there and the offense will\ncome later on\ndo we want to score more goals of course\nwe do and we we have to\nbut if we're chasing goals all over the\nplace and giving up too many we're\nprobably uh\nyou know going to be in trouble\n\n\u003e Q: on [[Brandt Clarke|Brandt]]\nwe've talked about obviously you know\nwhat he's shown in Camp on the ice the\nskills that he has and the growth that's\nobviously there also I wrote how much\ndoes his\ndoes this confidence that there's even a\nseems to be a little bit of swagger a\nlittle little attitude whatsoever how\nmuch does that even\ncarried him\nthrough this camp and to this point\nwhere maybe he can be playing tomorrow\nnight \n\u003e\n\u003e A: I I think that that has helped him\nimmensely\num\nhe knows who Brandt knows who Brandt is he\nknows what's in his toolbox in his tool\nkit\num he hasn't played with fear and what I\nmean by fear is not the the physical\npart but fear of\nof\nerroring on the ice he makes plays he\nattempts plays uh he's been very\ncoachable throughout training camp\num you know potentially away from the\nKing's family I could see where that\nconfidence or that Swagger may be\nmisread\nin other environments\num where it could hurt him but so far\nnot in ours not one bit\n\n\u003e Q: Todd, the last few preseason games it's like a\nlot of goals in the second period I\nthink I counted 10 goals against\nanything that tendencies that were\nhappening or not happening\n\u003e\n\u003e A: um while we get off we've had good\nstarts in the exhibition season\nwe get to the break we come out and we\nwe seem to take\npenalties\npenalties that aren't really important\nin anything that's going on away from\nthe puck in the o-zone the neutral zone\nI'd like to think that that can be\ncleaned up\nthose are individuals more than team\nmistakes I'd like to think that gets\ncleaned up and um early in the year that\ncan swing the momentum a big way but\nother than that I don't have\nanything else to put my finger on\n\n\u003e Q: You just mentioned [[Phillip Danault|Danault]] and [[Adrian Kempe|Kempe]] who\n\u003e both had career seasons last year\n\u003e  what have you seen or what do you know\nabout them that means you to believe\nthat could be the norm as opposed to be\nexcept that being exceptions\n\u003e\n\u003e A: well I have a longer track record with\nAdrian and to me where Adrian the day I\nwalked in the door and Adrian was there\ntill now he's gone from boy to man in my\nopinion in his\nresponsibility for his own game has gone\nup immense immensely and I see that in\nthem so I'm confident that confidence\nthat he can carry on is he a 35 goal\nscorer I sure hope so\nbut I know he's a 20-minute player for\nsure most nights and that's just as\nimportant as being a a 35 goal scorer\nwith Phil\num\nPhil's ability to play in structure and\nread plays and be responsible for the\nother 20 minutes a night\num has always been there his breakout\nwas the offensive part and I think if he\ncontinues to do\num the things he did on the the\ndefensive side of the puck he's going to\nget those opportunities offensively as\nwell so they haven't shown signs that\nthey can't repeat\n\n\u003e Q: What are you looking to bring out of\n\u003e [[Quinton Byfield]]'s game how would you\n\u003e assess where he's at and what you want\n\u003e to see from him, I guess a blueprint this year\n\u003e\n\u003e A: well a year ago we were putting him in a\ncast and we were putting them on the\nshelf for\nfour months four and a half months\nwe're not doing that now so he's way\nfurther ahead he's bigger he's stronger\nhe's skating better he's over top of\npucks a lot more\num\nthe evaluation tool I think on the\nexteriors all these goals and assists\nand can he be that or whatever he in my\nmind is already a better player now than\nhe was last year at this point\nnow we've got to let him play and find\nhis way and\num\nthe rest should happen as the night goes\non but as the year goes on Pardon Me not\ntonight but as the year goes on\n\n\u003e Q: Todd with [[Kevin Fiala|Fiala]], he might be the only new player in your\nlineup tomorrow night\nnow that you've seen him in the\npreseason games practices for a couple\nof weeks is there anything about his\ngame that maybe he didn't know that\nyou're really appreciating\n\u003e \n\u003e A: um\nthere were\nassumptions that we made based on his\nPoint totals and video and that type of\nstuff you know the the hockey sense the\nsense of timing space finish\nthose assumptions to this point were\ngood assumptions on our behalf because\nwe've seen that so it's the overall\npackage and it's just\nthroughout exhibition season confirming\nwhat we believed we were getting and\nwhat we\nhad viewed in the past but now we see it\nfull time or if that makes any sense but\nthat's that would be my answer for that\n\n\u003e Q: the [[Viktor Arvidsson]] uh did he come back\nsooner than you as anticipated and how\ndid he look off the other off the other\nnight in terms of being able to jump in\nthe front\n\u003e\n\u003e A: um not necessarily sooner uh Victor's\nbeen on a\nfrom the day he was ruled out last year\nin whatever it was April May\ntill now he's followed pretty much the\ncalendar of events that we thought would\nhappen\num and he's worked really hard\nto get himself back into the lineup his\neagerness and excitement about being\nback in is really healthy I thought he\nhad a real good game\num no one one game\nhe's going to have to do it\nover and over again but he completes the\nidentity of that line\nthey spent a lot of time talking and and\nanalyzing how they play that's I think\nmakes them effective\nand he shown no signs of\nfatigue or anything else negative\n\n\u003e Q: this is the healthiest the roster has\nbeen a year\ngee thanks\nis it harder or easier to make decisions\nnow\nbased on everyone being available\n\u003e\n\u003e A: um\nit's a mix some players made it easy\nsome are making it harder some are\nmaking it clear both ways for and\nagainst their play\num\nI I would be lying if I said I wasn't\nconcerned about bringing all the banged\nup guys back at once [[Viktor Arvidsson|Arvy]]'s played one\ngame [[Sean Durzi|Durzi]]'s played two\nyou know these guys are coming back in\nwithout a lot of\num training camp time\nother teams are in that situation too so\nwe just got to figure it out as we go\n\n\u003e Q: when you were introduced as head coach\nyou introduced the marathon metaphor now\nit's the start of year four how far\nalong is the club in that metaphorical\nMarathon compared to where you'd like\n\u003e\n\u003e A: well we've settled into the race now\nwe've climbed some hills we've got in\nsome valleys\nI think in marathons there's\num\nplayers or players Runners that break\naway and sometimes the pack catches them\nagain I would say we're in that pack and\num you know we're no longer in miles one\nthrough five we're way further into it\nbut if crossing the finish line and\nputting a medal around your neck is the\nStanley Cup Championship we we still\nhave a lot of running to do\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.664147713Z","tags":null},"/Helge-Grans":{"title":"Helge Grans","content":"\n# Helge Grans\n\n| NHL.com / Ontario Reign | Twitter

It goes up and down. The chemistry will come. We’re three good players and I can see our line being very effective. And I think tonight will be the night.\n\n\u003e I feel pretty confident in this arena,” he said. “Obviously, I played here a lot of games. It helped for sure. \n\n\u003e Some guys connect. Some guys don’t. I’ve known him a long time. We played in Milwaukee before and Nashville before. If you have time with each other as a person like off the ice and on the ice, you have more time to click. I think that was also a big reason. We like each other off the ice. On the ice as well obviously. That’s why we clicked.\n\n\u003e It was nice. Seeing the support of the fans — just nice. I enjoyed it. I had fun. But everything else was business. It’s also nice they do it in the start of the game so you can kind of let it go.\n\u003e\n\u003e I love the fans here. And I think they like me too.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e That’s a good point because we can overload with a hundred different things and that doesn’t help him. I think by this point he understands our demeanor. When I say ours, our coaching staff. But also his teammates. Who’s emotional, who isn’t. What gets guys riled up. What’s the boiling point for good and bad. And often for a player, once that gets clarified it’s a lot easier.\n\u003e \n\u003e From a technical or team standpoint, I think he’s beginning to understand our language. The game can only be played so many ways, so many systems. Often, we can confuse players with the language we use so I think he’s beginning to understand that. And then special teams for us, from a power-play perspective, there’s a lot of change for everybody. Not just for new people coming in and that being Kevin. We’re all adjusting to that.\n\n### [[Dean Evanson]]\n\u003e He’s obviously a gifted hockey player that has special skills and can score. He’s done it throughout his whole career. I’ve seen it for many years. You give him an opportunity, he’s going to put it in the net.\n\n\u003e He had a lot of adjustments as a young player coming in, not only to the NHL but obviously to North America. He’s clearly a better player than he was when he first came over.\n\n### Jonny Gaudreau\n\u003e Most important thing is his passion. He loves the game. I do too. We’ve always had fun playing together.\n\n\u003e I think it’s important for a player like him that he has a free mindset in some ways to express himself offensively because he has some of the best skills in the league. He can really just beat guys in places that normally you don’t see. So, it’s important for him to put that mindset into his game. To beat guys. Be an offensive weapon every single night.\n\u003e \n\u003e I think on my side, I was trying to allow him to do that in some ways and bring some security to that line. Sometimes maybe backing them up a little bit more and letting these guys express themselves. But it was just fun to play with a guy like that. He’s a fun guy to show up to the rink with every day.

In addition, Aaron Cooney has been named Manager of Hockey Communications and Justin Cummings is the Hockey Communications Specialist.\n\n\u003e It was done, basically done over the summer. There was never really an official announcement, just because we didn’t feel we needed to on that aspect, but yes, that was taken care of there, probably immediately after the season was over. -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\u003e Nelson Emerson\nEmerson has spent the last 15 seasons in the Kings organization, most recently serving as Director of Player Personnel from 2017-18 to 2021-22. Prior to that, he spent the previous 10 seasons in the Player Development department. He was originally named to the coaching staff on July 10, 2006 and spent the two seasons as an Assistant Coach after serving as a Coaches Aide in 2003-04. The native of Hamilton, Ontario appeared in 771 career games, including 124 with the Kings from 2000-02, and recorded 488 points (195-293) overall. Originally selected by the St. Louis Blues in the third round (44th overall) of the 1985 NHL Entry Draft, the forward also had 22 points (7-15=22) in 40 playoff games. While at Bowling Green State University of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA), Emerson was a two-time All-American, a three-time CCHA All-Star, and a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award three times (1988-90). He remains the school’s all-time leading scorer with 294 points.\n\n\u003e Glen Murray\nMurray has held multiple roles in the Player Development department dating back to 2016, most recently serving as Director of Player Development since 2018. The former Kings forward joined the front office on a part-time basis in 2011-12 during the club’s first Stanley Cup championship season. After four-plus seasons as a consultant, he formally joined the Player Development department in 2016. A native of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Murray played 16 seasons in the NHL including his time with the Kings from 1996-02. He played in 1,009 regular-season games and recorded 651 points (337-314=651) with Los Angeles, Boston and Pittsburgh. A two-time All-Star, Murray recorded a career-high in 2002-03 with 44 goals, 48 assists and 92 points in 82 games. He scored as many as 28 goals in a season five different times including a team-high 29 goals with the Kings during the 1997-98 season. His 41 goals in 2001-02 were second-most in the NHL.\n\n\u003e Derik Johnson\nJohnson joined the Kings in 2018 and has spent the last four seasons as an assistant video coach while also working with players on the ice after morning skates and filling in on the bench for some games last season. Prior to that, he was a video coach with the Bakersfield Condors of the American Hockey League for the 2017-18 season. Johnson was a defenseman at the University of Minnesota-Duluth and tallied 17 points (2-15=17) in 108 games over four seasons. He went on to play professionally for three seasons, tallying 29 points (8-21=29) in 129 ECHL appearances (Missouri Mavericks and Reading Royals) from 2014-17. In 2015-16, he made his AHL debut, skating in four games with the Springfield Falcons.\n\n\u003e Andy Johnson\nJohnson joins the Kings after spending the last five seasons serving as general manager and director of scouting for the Sioux City Musketeers of the USHL. This past season, Johnson led Sioux City to their first Clark Cup Championship in two decades and was named USHL General Manager of the Year. Johnson’s career spans nine seasons, all in the USHL, where he’s held positions in various capacities, including scout, director of scouting, assistant general manager and general manager split between Sioux City (2017-22), the Waterloo Black Hawks (2014-17) and Muskegon Lumberjacks (2013-14).\n\n\u003e Sara Hickmann\nDr. Hickmann brings over 20 years of sport psychology experience to the Kings, while also serving as Team Psychologist and Director of Mental Health and Wellness for the Los Angeles Clippers. Prior to her time at the Clippers, Dr. Hickmann held similar positions with the Brooklyn Nets (2010-14) and New York Jets (2009-2014). She worked for the NFL league office as the Director of Player Assistance Programs (2004-2009) and managed the clinical side for the NFL’s Personal Conduct Program (2006-2022). Her other professional experiences include working as an embedded Psychologist with Naval Special Warfare/Navy SEALS in Coronado, CA and creating a Cognitive Agility Training course for the Special Operations Central Command in Tampa, FL. Dr. Hickmann earned her Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst in 2004.\n\n\u003e Shane Bennett\nBennett begins his first season in professional hockey as a Data Engineer for the Kings. He spent the past three years as a data engineer and analyst for Team Select Home Care. Bennett earned his bachelor’s degree in Business Information Systems and Analytics from the University of Denver in 2019.\n\n\u003e Aaron Cooney\nCooney spent the past season as the Director of Communications and Broadcasting with the San Diego Gulls of the American Hockey League.

Cooney has also worked with the Pittsburgh Penguins Radio Network.\n\n\u003e Justin Cummings\nThis past season, Cummings served as a communications graduate assistant with the Pittsburgh Penguins. His other experience includes the Manchester Monarchs (2017-19), Boston Bruins (2019-20) and USA Hockey’s NTDP (2020-21). He served as a communications assistant with the Monarchs while attending the University of New Hampshire.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.664147713Z","tags":null},"/Kings-at-NHL.com":{"title":"NHL","content":"\n# NHL\n\n| URL          | Feed     | Twitter                                |\n| ------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------- |\n| [Kings at NHL.com](https://www.nhl.com/kings) | [Feed]() | [@twitterHandle](https://twitter.com/) | \n\n\n## Articles\n| Title | Source Link | Date Published |\n| ----- | ----------- | -------------- |\n|       |             |                |\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.664147713Z","tags":null},"/Kings-look-for-Quinton-Byfield-to-play-big-and-show-leadership-among-rookies":{"title":"Kings look for Quinton Byfield to ‘play big’ and show leadership among rookies","content":"\n# Kings look for Quinton Byfield to ‘play big’ and show leadership among rookies\n\n| Date       | Site             | Link                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| ---------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-09-17 | [[The Athletic]] | [Kings look for Quinton Byfield to ‘play big’ and show leadership among rookies](https://theathletic.com/3602990/2022/09/17/quinton-byfield-kings-rookie-tournament/) |\n| 2022-09-17 | [[The Athletic]] | [[Kings look for Quinton Byfield to ‘play big’ and show leadership among rookies]]                                                                                    |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Eric Stephens]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Marco Sturm]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The moment when Quinton Byfield really realized why he plays hockey and wants to be an impact player in the NHL came in May, at Rogers Place in Edmonton — Game 1, Kings vs. Oilers.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n- Trained with Gary Roberts over the summer.\n\n### [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\u003e It was unbelievable. We were staying on the bench for ‘O Canada.’ You look up. The whole crowd is wearing orange. Singing ‘O Canada.’ You actually had goosebumps in there. How loud it was.\n\u003e \n\u003e You watched it all growing up. Stanley Cup playoffs. To be one of the 16 teams left, it was really exciting. I’m looking forward to being back there every other year.\n\n\u003e I look at it like it’s kind of a good thing for me as well. I’m getting to know all the younger prospects as well. They said they want me to have a leadership role here. I kind of look forward to that and progress in my career with that leadership role as well.\n\u003e \n\u003e I’m looking at it like that and I see a lot of positive this weekend. Just play a couple games before training camp and before the season. Get the feel before. Maybe have a step on everyone else and be in game shape.\n\n\u003e I had the whole short side. I don’t know if I whiffed or it just bounced over my stick or whatever. No, it definitely sucks. You want to score. I think the goalie had my number this game as well. He made a lot of saves on me.\n\n\u003e I just feel more confident in just holding onto pucks. Protection. Just more confident in the corners. And just being at home. Just working with a lot of other pros. Really good players. Just being able to do the protection against them and just keep up to their level. Definitely playing with quite a bit of confidence.\n\n\u003e I feel like confidence is a huge thing is hockey and just in sports as well. If you have that, you have the swagger to make any play. You walk around just with confidence. I feel like I lost that a little bit last year.\n\u003e \n\u003e I wasn’t really playing like how I know I’ve played and how I’ve played my whole life growing up. I feel good now and I feel confident again. I just want to continue that into the season.\n\n### [[Marco Sturm]]\n\u003e It’s very important to have a guy like him in the lineup and having him around too, all weekend. I think he already is taking charge on the ice and off the ice. And I think it’s just going to help him as a hockey player and as a person. I’m very pleased that he’s around.\n\n\u003e I thought he was our best forward. I know he didn’t score and didn’t have a point. But he’s good. He’s very demanding. And he should be. If not, then we’re in trouble.\n\u003e \n\u003e But I got to say he came in really good shape. He worked really hard this summer. I can tell. We can all tell. Hopefully he’s going to grab that spot with the Kings and make that next step.","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.664147713Z","tags":null},"/Kings-open-season-with-heartbreaking-loss-to-Golden-Knights-Los-Angeles-Times":{"title":"Kings open season with heartbreaking loss to Golden Knights - Los Angeles Times","content":"\n\n# Kings open season with heartbreaking loss to Golden Knights - Los Angeles Times\n\n| Date       | Site         | Link                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| ---------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[LA Times]] | [Kings open season with heartbreaking loss to Golden Knights - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-10-11/kings-season-opener-golden-knights-stanley-cup) |\n| 2022-10-11 | [[LA Times]] | [[Kings open season with heartbreaking loss to Golden Knights - Los Angeles Times]]                                                                                                      |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Helene Elliott]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Phillip Danault]]\n- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e When Todd McLellan was hired to coach the downtrodden Kings in 2019, he compared them to marathon runners at Mile 1. With a hard-fought playoff series loss behind him and the deepest, most skillful lineup he has had at his disposal, McLellan updated that analogy as he began his fourth season.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e We’ve settled into the race now. We’ve climbed some hills. We got in some valleys. I think in marathons there’s runners that break away and sometimes the pack catches them again. I would say we’re in that pack. We’re no longer in Miles 1 through 5. We’re way further into it.\n\u003e \n\u003e But if crossing the finish line and putting a medal around your neck is the Stanley Cup championship, we still have a lot of running to do. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e We wasted an outstanding goaltending effort by not getting a point tonight. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e We made a step last year but now we have to make sure we’re taking the ability to move past that and keep that going. I think there’s less and less concerns through our lineup. I think there still are at different times and there will be at times as the season goes on, but I do think we have players that can fill some certain roles and we do have some depth in the right positions if needed. -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\u003e I think Rob has made some really good moves and it just shows us that he believes in us and he spent that money for a really good player that we needed. Rob did a big move, and now it’s our time to show it on the ice. -- [[Phillip Danault]]\n\n\u003e Yes, I can do it again. I can’t wait to see what this year is going to bring, and obviously I’m waiting for what I’ve wanted to achieve my whole life — winning the Cup. -- [[Phillip Danault]]\n\n\u003e We definitely have an expectation of Phil that now increases offensively, but I think a lot of it surrounds around his leadership. I felt that he added a big touch to that. That created excitement some of those players bought in. And now we have to get that out of Kevin Fiala, we have to get it out of some of our young guys who are going to take a little bit more prominent roles on the team. -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\u003e Is he a 35-goal scorer? I sure hope so. But I know he’s a 20-minute player for sure most nights, and that’s just as important as being a 35-goal scorer. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e When you get into tight situations or an overtime situation and you’re relying on a big player to step up, he’s now at that level for us. -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.664147713Z","tags":null},"/Kings-score-seven-hold-off-late-rally-by-Wild-for-first-win-of-season":{"title":"Kings score seven, hold off late rally by Wild for first win of season","content":"\n# Kings score seven, hold off late rally by Wild for first win of season\n\n| Date       | Site    | Link                                                                                                                                                       |\n| ---------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[Kings at NHL.com]] | [Kings score seven, hold off late rally by Wild for first win of season](https://www.nhl.com/news/los-angeles-kings-minnesota-wild-game-recap/c-335870572) |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[Kings at NHL.com]] | [[Kings score seven, hold off late rally by Wild for first win of season]]                                                                                 |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jessi Pierce]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n- [[Alex Iafallo]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Drew Doughty]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Kevin Fiala scored his first goal for the Los Angeles Kings and had two assists in a 7-6 win against the Minnesota Wild at Xcel Energy Center on Saturday.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e Sometimes you feel better than other days, and today I felt pretty good from the start. Obviously a little more motivated playing against them, my old team, but it was good. A good first step in our direction and myself as well, and now we just have to build from it. -- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n\u003e If you'd have told us we were going to score seven goals, I'd have been jumping for joy. The giving up the six isn't the ideal recipe. That's a really hard game to explain. I'm not sure that we're going to give six goals up and win a game again this year. … Strange night. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e Everybody struggled, right? You get seven goals scored on, your team struggles. To pin it on one guy or one guy didn't play well from the goalie out … everybody didn't play well, or else we would have not given up seven goals. -- [[Dean Evanson]]\n\n\u003e Offensively, it was a really good game for us, so that was a step in the right direction for us. On the other side of the puck, I think there are still some things we can improve, but you know, I think we deserved the win tonight. Even if it was 1-0 or 7-6, it doesn't matter right now. That's a huge first win. We got better in all three zones, and that was a good thing. -- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.664147713Z","tags":null},"/Kings-vs-Wild-NHL-Game-Recap-October-15-2022-ESPN":{"title":"Kings vs Wild - NHL Game Recap - October 15, 2022 - ESPN","content":"\n# Kings vs Wild - NHL Game Recap - October 15, 2022 - ESPN\n\n| Date       | Site     | Link                                                                                                          |\n| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[ESPN]] | [Kings vs Wild - NHL Game Recap - October 15, 2022 - ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nhl/recap/_/gameId/401458618) |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[ESPN]] | [[Kings vs Wild - NHL Game Recap - October 15, 2022 - ESPN]]                                                  |\n\n## Contributors\n- AP\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- \n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e \n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.664147713Z","tags":null},"/Kiril-Kirsanov":{"title":"Kiril Kirsanov","content":"\n# Kiril Kirsanov\n\n| EliteProspects                                                                 | Twitter                                 |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |\n| [Kiril Kirsanov](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/542519/kirill-kirsanov) | [@twitter_handle](https://twitter.com/) |\n\n| Player         | \\#  | Position | Shoots | Height | Weight | Born       | Birthplace | Draft |\n| -------------- | --- | -------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ---------- | ---------- | ----- |\n| Kiril Kirsanov |     | D        | L      | 6' 1\"  | 198    | 2022-09-19 | Tver, RUS  | LAK 3rd Rd 2021 84 overall       |\n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n|      |      |       |\n\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n|      |      |       |\n\n\n\n## Post-Draft Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n|      |      |       |\n\n\n\n## Pre-Draft Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n|      |      |       |\n\n\n## Unprocessed Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n|      |      |       |\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.664147713Z","tags":null},"/Kracken-vs-Kings-NHL-Game-Recap-October-13-2022-ESPN":{"title":"Kracken vs Kings - NHL Game Recap - October 13, 2022 - ESPN","content":"\n# Kracken vs Kings - NHL Game Recap - October 13, 2022 - ESPN\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-13 | [[ESPN]]  | [Kracken vs Kings - NHL Game Recap - October 13, 2022 - ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nhl/recap/_/gameId/401461539)\n2022-10-13 | [[ESPN]] | [[Kracken vs Kings - NHL Game Recap - October 13, 2022 - ESPN]]\n\n\n## Contributors\n- \n\n\n## Players\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Brandon Tanev scored the go-ahead goal early in the second period and the Seattle Kraken rebounded from an opening loss to beat the Los Angeles Kings 4-1 on Thursday night.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e Well, it’s a losing streak to start the season already ’cause we’re at two and haven’t put one on the board yet.

They will have another in 2021 first-rounder, Brandt Clarke. The 19-year-old has reportedly made the team’s 23-man roster for Opening Night.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Rob Blake]]\n\u003e “I think we have some experience on our staff. I think Trent Yawney has done a terrific job with some young D and the different organizations he’s been in, so we’ve relied on his help on that. Jim Heller went through the situation with the young D on the Islanders a couple of years ago. So basically, it comes down to making sure when he does get in a lineup, he’s going to get the right amount of minutes to keep developing.\n\n\u003e I think his play through rookie camp and training camp put him to a level where we want to see him in the NHL and that kind of went into the decision process. But now the step is to make sure that it keeps going that way, and we’ll let that play out here the first little while and probably have to reevaluate again.\n\n\u003e I think he can play in all situations, use him a lot on the penalty kill, which can give you an opportunity to get the minutes needed to keep developing at the NHL level. The powerplay, obviously, you see the deception and his hockey IQ in that. But also defending, good in his sense. He’s gonna have to learn to protect himself a little bit more. Guys are bigger and stronger at this level than in junior.\n\u003e But I think the all-around game, there’s a lot of aspects that would allow a player, when he does get in a lineup in the regular season, to maintain those minutes that are going to help progress.\n\n\u003e We’ve tried quite a few over there. Sean Walker has played there at times. I think we gotta get him comfortable coming back from knee surgery before we experiment again with the left side. Sean Durzi, you saw the last game slide over there and made that transition really easy. And we’ve used Brandt Clark a couple of times over there. So the availability to open up that left side within our defense can increase getting Brandt in the lineup and getting the minutes he needs.","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.664147713Z","tags":null},"/LA-Kings-Kopitar-aim-to-correct-mistakes-Notes-on-Quick-Vilardi-Fiala":{"title":"LA Kings, Kopitar aim to correct mistakes - Notes on Quick, Vilardi, Fiala","content":"\n# LA Kings, Kopitar aim to correct mistakes - Notes on Quick, Vilardi, Fiala\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-14 |  | [LA Kings, Kopitar aim to correct mistakes - Notes on Quick, Vilardi, Fiala](https://hockeyroyalty.com/2022/10/12/la-kings-kopitar-aim-to-correct-mistakes-plus-notes-on-quick-vilardi-fiala/)\n2022-10-12 | [[Hockey Royalty]] | [[LA Kings, Kopitar aim to correct mistakes - Notes on Quick, Vilardi, Fiala]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Ryan Sikes]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n- [[Jonathan Quick]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Sean Durzi]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Todd McLellan didn’t mince words following the game, calling the game’s fourth goal “stupidity” on his team’s part.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\n\u003e We’ll get it corrected for sure. You can chalk it up to a first game and all of that, but the bottom line is we just can’t afford to lose a game like that with the amount of mistakes that we made. -- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\n\u003e Well, the end result because we were still in it at the end of the night, so losing the game that we got an outstanding effort by our goaltender, and we still had a chance to win and had a chance on point, really.

He’s adjusting to a new team. I think if you refer back to Phil Danault’s time early last year, it didn’t go easy. And I think we’re going to see more and more from Kevin.

These are the hardest games. When there’s not a ton of rhythm. There’s a lot of penalties. You’re trying to get yourself in it. It’s the first game of the season, too. I think there’s a lot of kinks that I’m trying to get out and the team’s trying to get out.\n\n\u003e Hopefully never have to win one like that again.\n\n\u003e It was a little bit challenging. You want to start out with camp right away. I had a really good summer, and I was really looking forward to kind of building that into camp. Getting a little injured was a little bit of a setback and you kind of feel like you’re having to play catch-up. Luckily it was minor. The thing with the season is you try and build into it as much as you can. Try and play your best hockey at the end of it.\n\u003e \n\u003e It’s more so just taking your time with the process, realizing you’re not going to be perfect right away and try and get better every day.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e If we look at his preseason, he goes to San Jose and plays the first period basically and then he’s out for a week. Eight or night days. Doesn’t feel the puck. Comes back into it and it’s not an easy task. For me, goaltending’s a lot like pitching. It’s tough to find your Cy Young winner in April. You usually find him in September and October. And goaltending around the league is probably like that. It’s finding its way.\n\u003e \n\u003e We have to help our goaltenders as much as we can. We haven’t been as tight as we’ve been. We haven’t broken out as clean (from our end). The penalty parade puts a lot of pressure on them.\n\n\u003e Probably both teams were thinking the same thing. Get us a save and we’ll get you a goal. Obviously, that was the way the night was going. We did give up six. I’m not sure that we can pin them all on Cal Petersen.\n\u003e \n\u003e What’s important for him is he got a win. He’s got some confidence as far as winning goes. And the team got that but it’s pretty evident we have to clean some things up.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.664147713Z","tags":null},"/LA-Kings-hope-to-settle-in-after-penalties-and-mistakes-evident-vs-Vegas":{"title":"LA Kings hope to ‘settle in’ after penalties and mistakes evident vs Vegas","content":"\n# LA Kings hope to ‘settle in’ after penalties and mistakes evident vs Vegas\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-12 | [[The Athletic]] | [LA Kings hope to ‘settle in’ after penalties and mistakes evident vs Vegas](https://theathletic.com/3682833/2022/10/12/kings-golden-knights-season-opener/)\n2022-10-12 | [[The Athletic]] | [[LA Kings hope to ‘settle in’ after penalties and mistakes evident vs Vegas]]\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Eric Stephens]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n- [[Jonathan Quick]]\n- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n- [[Arthur Kaliyev]]\n- [[Sean Durzi]]\n- [[Trevor Moore]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Alex Iafallo]]\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n- [[Matt Roy]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Thoughtful by nature whenever a question comes his way before he gives an answer, Todd McLellan ruminated on the unique element that is managing a team on its opening night as he went into his fourth with the Kings and 15th as an NHL head coach.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e I used to get all wound up. I get excited about opening night. But I also understand that based on experience, there’s so many highs and lows. Teams can be too wound up and too excited to play. They can be under-aroused. Execution can be poor but intent good. You can just be flat-out red rotten. There’s so many variables that go into opening night that it’s hard to predict where it will go.\n\u003e That second game is kind of where it really begins to settle in. You can’t put too much (into the first game). You can’t get too high or too low after opening night, I guess, is what I’m saying. Just because it’s so random. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e He’s proven it for 15 years. It’s certainly something that we’ve talked (about) before. I’m sure we’re going to talk going forward. -- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\n\u003e Knowing where the puck is coming out of the penalty box on a line change. You got to be aware of that. Missing the net on that play.  \\[...] A set breakout that we work on all the time. You’ve got numerous options. So, that is all game management. That’s getting engaged and being ready to go. Their team did a better job of it than we did tonight. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e It wasn’t all bad. But there’s stuff that we can certainly correct and eliminate from our games that are going to make us sharper and win more games. -- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\n\u003e We’ve preached and preached about it. Sometimes you got to get hit pretty hard with a two-by-four. Maybe this was it. You look at some of the penalties we’ve taken throughout exhibition season. I think I’ve mentioned it a few times. Penalized more away from our net than we were near our net. And what I mean by that is neutral zone and offensive zone.\n\u003e \n\u003e Maybe it’s not important yet, I don’t know. But it’ll cost you eventually and it did tonight.  -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e We’ll correct that for sure.\n\u003e You can chalk it up to a first game and all of that. “But the bottom line is we just can’t afford to lose a game like that.

There’s a group – a lot of them aren’t here anymore – there’s still a few that aren’t quite going to get it done. And that’s just the way it is. Not everybody can play.\n\u003e Our big concern is that middle group and what are they going to do and when are they going to do it. We’ve got three or four days left here before we’ve got to play that team again. Obviously both clubs are going to get better. They’re going to put different players in the lineup. We’ve given up 10 goals in the last six periods we’ve played. That’s not who we are and that’s not how we should be playing.\n\u003e I know they’re better than that. And that’s why we’re waiting for them. They’ve got to make these decisions now instead of seven, eight, 10 games into the season and they realize it’s a little bit too late. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n- [[Brandt Clarke]] is making it difficult for the Kings to send him back to the OHL.\n\n\u003e When I came in, my intentions were to stick around as long as possible, to kind of open a couple people’s eyes on my play and my style. And I think that’s what I’ve been doing. I’m really happy with how I’ve been playing. I’m really happy with the atmosphere around here. Everyone is so welcoming and I’m really happy to be here. I want to stay as long as I can. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n- [[Sean Durzi]] made his preseason debut at the last preseason game after completing his return from off-seasons shoulder surgery. \n\n\u003e I thought he did some good things on one side of the puck and others that he has to sharpen up. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e It’s kind of back to the drawing board. Make my reads quicker. Watch the tape and learn. Quite honestly, it’s three periods left in the preseason. Go in tomorrow, regrouping. Looking at what I can do better, which is a lot. I think there’s a lot more I can do and a lot I can fix in my game, quite honestly. It’s going back, learning from it and quite honestly just executing.\n\u003e You want to do it right away.

In order to cement the deal, Los Angeles then promptly signed the 25 year old winger to a seven-year contract extension. \n\u003e As a result, the Kings do not have the salary cap flexibility they had a couple of weeks ago. And with multiple RFA’s needing new deals, LA does not seem like a club that is a prime candidate to be big players in free agency. \n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/Luc-Robitaille":{"title":"Luc Robitaille","content":"\n# Luc Robitaille\n\nNHL.com | Twitter\n-|-\n[Luc Robitaille]() | [@twitter_handle](https://twitter.com/)\n\nTitle | Organization \n--- | ---\nPresident, Alternate Governor | LA Kings\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\nDate | Title\n---|---\n\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\nDate | Title\n---|---\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/Manon-Rheaume-first-woman-to-play-NHL-period-starts-anew-with-Kings-Los-Angeles-Times":{"title":"Manon Rheaume, first woman to play NHL period, starts anew with Kings - Los Angeles Times","content":"\n# Manon Rheaume, first woman to play NHL period, starts anew with Kings - Los Angeles Times\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-05 | [[LA Times]] | [Manon Rheaume, first woman to play NHL period, starts anew with Kings - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-10-05/column-nhl-woman-goalie-manon-rheaume)\n2022-10-05 | [[LA Times]] | [[Manon Rheaume, first woman to play NHL period, starts anew with Kings - Los Angeles Times]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Helene Elliott]]\n\n\n## Players\n- \n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Manon Rheaume]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Playing goal was as natural to Manon Rheaume as breathing.\n\u003e \\[...]\n\u003e She also didn’t intend to make history, but she couldn’t say no when the expansion Tampa Bay Lightning invited her to their training camp after she had helped Canada win gold at the 1992 women’s world championships.\n\u003e \\[...]\n\u003e Thirty years later, she has made it to the NHL. Not in uniform but as a member of the Kings’ player development department, one of many accomplished women who have been hired for meaningful roles on NHL teams the past few years. \n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e I personally find, same with Blake Bolden, that these girls are overachievers. They work really hard, and when you get them in your organization, they bring that attitude. It’s amazing to see. To me, I think there’s huge value.\n\u003e Manon, with her background and how much work she had to do and fighting against adversity to get to the level she got, there’s certainly a lot that could be taught to those young players. -- [[Luc Robitaille]]\n\n\u003e It’s really meeting our draft picks and getting to know them and see if I can see or feel something about those players. More like as a mom. Having two kids that play, I know when things go wrong, they call me. I don’t know if it’s easier to talk with me than their dad. I feel like I’m bringing that side of it.  -- [[Manon Rheaume]]\n\n\u003e All those women that played at a high level, even if they don’t make it to the NHL, they’re able to contribute to an NHL team in a different way with their ideas and their knowledge of the game. -- [[Manon Rheaume]]\n\n\u003e You can ask me, could I have played in the NHL way back then? Doing a training camp is one thing. Doing a full year, facing those shots, I was bruised all over after a week. Physically, I didn’t have the same strength as a man possessed.\n\u003e \n\u003e But I cannot say that a woman could never play there, because you never know. You could have a woman that’s super strong, super fast, or a female goaltender that is big and very agile and can play at that level. Nobody thought I would be able to do it in camp, so that’s why I would never say no. -- [[Manon Rheaume]]\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/Marco-Sturm-Preseason-Postgame-10-8":{"title":"Marco Sturm Preseason Postgame 10-8","content":"\n# Marco Sturm Preseason Postgame 10-8\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n 2022-10-08   | [[Ontario Reign on Youtube]]  | [Marco Sturm Preseason Postgame 10-8]()\n\n## Contributors\n- \n\n## Players\n- \n\n## Staff\n- [[Marco Sturm]]\n\n## Summary\n\n\n## Notes\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eKa2ZPlj2nc\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n\u003e Q: Well what are some of the things that, pre\n-season that you try to do it's obviously\nuh not the same Personnel but what are\nsome of the things you're trying to do\nand evaluate here\n\u003e A: I mean uh you know\nyou know who uh uh a game like this some\nguys never even played a game yet\num you know you want to try to get your\nlegs going and try to try to do the\nstuff we've worked on all week and uh\nand and try to yeah the best play you\ncan be you know there's a I think that\nthere's a lot of guys\num who could show me and uh and uh the\ncoaching staff what they can do what\nthey can bring for the team and uh and\nuh yeah that's what's nice and\neverything's all about \n\n\u003e Q: opportunities for\na lot of different players who might not\nbe on the power play all the time to get\nmore than one opportunity out there\ntonight what did you see from the power\nplay and what did you like what did you\nnot like\n\u003e A: well um I think we got scored on twice\non our power play and we got two or\nthree goals against on the BK so so that\nhas to be\nthat's that you know that has to be uh\nyeah\nfixed and uh you know but a lot of\ndifferent guys in a lot of different\npositions today so\num but again I think there is some areas\ntoday we we have to work on it I think\nthere's some guys in uh in this Locker\nwho will be here who have to be better\ntoo there is no\nyou know season starts in a week so you\nknow there's a short turnaround and uh\nyeah I think the guys\nbeen going gard really\nfor all week long they deserve to have a\nday off tomorrow and then regroup and\ntry to be better on Monday\n\n\u003e Q: some of those things that you said need\nto be fixed you know you have a\nbasically a week until uh opening night\nare those things that need to be fixed\nare they are they quick fixes are they\nthings that take time \n\u003e A: yeah there's a few\nthings I think it's in our control and\nuh\nand I think uh the mistakes we made\nespecially the first 40 45 minutes it\nwas\neverything on on our tape and you know\nso we gotta keep things simple first I\nthink everyone has to know also their\nrole and their team and uh you know you\ndon't have to do anything special you\njust gotta\ngotta play hard you got to play for the\nteam and be a good teammate and uh and\nuh yeah win some hockey games \n\n\u003e Q: there's a\nlot of leaders in the room and you know\ntonight there's a couple of times where\nyou know there's things that get a\nlittle bit out of hand but you guys have\n[[Cameron Gaunce]] [[Jacob Doty]] I mean what's it\nlike to kind of have those guys that\nhave been around and know how to handle\nthemselves \n\u003e A: yeah I mean\nwe don't worry about that I know we're\nwe have a lot of toughness on our team\nbut again I'm not looking at I'm looking\nmore to I want to play hockey\num yes this is a big part of our our\nteam too and our game but end of the day\num you know I just didn't like the way\nwe played\num in general I think we had a good\nstart the first 10 minutes and after\nthat uh San Diego was just better than\nus and and also I still I still think\nthere's\nwe still had enough good players in our\nlineup and but again\nit was a good lesson for all of us and\nuh and now we just have to make sure\nit's not gonna happen again \n\n\u003e Q: you\nmentioned a day off tomorrow what does\nthe the week look like as far as getting\nready for an opening game on on Friday\nnight \n\u003e A: yeah no so I will see the day of\ntomorrow we're gonna go come back\num\nI think a few guys will will go down\nafter you know I think we're gonna have\na few guys from the Kings as well so the\nteam definitely will look different on\nMonday\nbut again we only have I think three\npractices next week until game one so we\njust gotta make sure\nwe focus and be doing the right things in\nthose three days and be the best we can\nin game one \n\u003e we look forward to talking\nto you then thanks\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/Marco-Sturm-Reign-Training-Camp-Day-2":{"title":"Marco Sturm -

We kept a heavy, hard team to 16 shots on goal, even strength. Our penalty kill did a really good job in a lot of situations,” he said. “I know we gave up a goal, but the 5-on-3 was really positive. So there are some things that we have to take from that game and look at it positively. The negative side, we’re a minute and a half in and we have a too many men on the ice penalty. Game management. Three O-zone penalties tonight. Game management. Three O-zone penalties. Game management. It’s something we’ve been harping and harping on and those are essentially impossible situations to practice, so they’ve got to take care of it.  -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e He’s a really nice guy and pretty goofy, to be honest. He liked to keep it light and then he’s got a great shot and works hard out there and wins battles and is a pretty good guy to play with. I obviously haven’t played with him much because he was playing with Zegras at world juniors. But he was a lot of fun to be around as a teammate and he meshed with everyone.\n\u003e He never took anything super serious when he didn’t need to. Obviously when the game started he dialed it in, but that was kind of it – we were practicing, if we’d have a big game the next day, in the morning skate, he was keeping it light. -- Matty Beniers on [[Arthur Kaliyev]]\n\n\u003e We dressed six defensemen tonight. I know he wasn’t six. I’m pretty sure he wasn’t five, and I don’t believe he was four either, so that’s what I thought of him. I thought he had a real good night, didn’t hurt us at all defensively, creative offensively. I’d like to see him shoot the puck a little bit because I think he’s got a great shot and loves to pass, but he had some really good looks at the net where he could’ve shot the puck.  -- [[Todd McLellan]] on [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e They’re a scrappy team, they get in the way a lot. Heavy, hard sticks. A lot of battles, a lot of crap coming out of the battles. There’s rarely anything clean when you play against them, so when you do have the opportunity – I thought we created more in the game, believe it or not, than what showed up on the scoreboard, and the simple fact is we didn’t want to shoot the puck. We wanted to be way more over-creative, and I think of two on ones, I think of three-on-ones, I think we almost had a four-on-one, we didn’t get any shots off. Just too cute. When we’re playing well – I thought you could kind of feel it in the third – we started to put some pressure on, we shot the puck, we got it back, get ‘em out of position, but a little too cute right now. Still trying to figure out who we are.  -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/Media-Sites":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/Mike-Donnelly":{"title":"Mike Donnelly","content":"\n# Mike Donnelly\n\nNHL.com | Twitter\n-|-\n[Mike Donnelly]() | [@twitter_handle](https://twitter.com/)\n\n| Title              | Organization |\n| ------------------ | ------------ |\n| Player Development | LA Kings     |\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date | Title |\n| ---- | ----- |\n\n\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\n| Date | Title |\n| ---- | ----- |\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/Mikey-Anderson":{"title":"Mikey Anderson","content":"\n# Mikey Anderson\n\nNHL.com / Ontario Reign | Twitter\n-|-\n[Mikey Anderson](https://www.nhl.com/player/mikey-anderson-8479998) | [@miklovin8](https://twitter.com/miklovin8)\n\nPlayer | \\# | Position | Shoots | Height | Weight | Born | Birthplace | Draft \n-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-\nMikey Anderson | 44 | LD | L | 6' 0\" | 195 | 1999-05-25 | Roseville, MN, USA | 2017 LAK, 4th rd, 10th pk (103rd overall)\n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\nDate | Site |  Title\n---|---|---\n2022-10-15 | [[The Forum Report]] | [[Cal starts -building NHL role with Wild, ex-prospect Middleton credits LA -Fialas big return -changes on defense]]\n2022-10-15 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[10-15 Preview - Potential Lineup + Fialas Return, Minnesota Natives, Seeking Identity - LA Kings Insider]]\n2022-10-12 | [[The Forum Report]] | [[Possession Chart - October 11 vs VGK]]\n2022-10-11 | [[ESPN]] | [[What to watch in Rangers-Lightning, Kings-Knights on ESPN]]\n2022-10-01 | [[LA Kings Insider]] |  [[With a blank slate, Kings focused on replicating second-half success on the penalty kill]]\n2022-09-27 | [[LA Kings Insider]] |  [[Day 6 Notes – Injury Updates + Grundstrom Opportunity, Anderson Debut and Kempe joins ATKM]]\n\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\nDate | Site |  Title\n---|---|---\n\n\n\n## Post-Draft Coverage\nDate | Site |  Title\n---|---|---\n\n\n\n## Pre-Draft Coverage\nDate | Site |  Title\n---|---|---\n\n\n## Unprocessed Coverage\n- \n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/NHL-RADIO-REPLAY-Hoven-on-LA-Kings-Season-Thus-Far-Plus-Key-Player-Storylines":{"title":"NHL RADIO REPLAY: Hoven on LA Kings Season Thus Far, Plus Key Player Storylines","content":"\n# NHL RADIO REPLAY: Hoven on LA Kings Season Thus Far, Plus Key Player Storylines\n\n| Date     | Site        | Link                 |\n| -------- | ----------- | -------------------- |\n| 2022-10-15 | [[Mayors Manor]] | [NHL RADIO REPLAY: Hoven on LA Kings Season Thus Far, Plus Key Player Storylines](https://mayorsmanor.com/2022/10/nhl-radio-replay-hoven-on-la-kings-season-thus-far-plus-key-player-storylines/) | \n\n## Contributors:\n- [[John Hoven]]\n- [[Dennis Bernstein]]\n\n## Players\n- \n\n## Summary\n\u003e \n\n## Notes\n- 00:01:14 \nWhat needs to be corrected when it comes to identity?\n[[Brandt Clarke]] and [[Gabe Vilardi]]\nHas been concerned about the acquisition of [[Kevin Fiala]] early on. After a big acquisition, there's an instinct to wait for that person to do it. But that's not how the Kings achieved what they achieved.\n\n- 00:03:12 \n[[Gabe Vilardi]], [[Quinton Byfield]], and [[Alex Iafallo]] - How important will the line be?\nMore people should be talking about Vilardi. Mayor thinks he was the highest skill player in the prospect pool. He's now starting to show that.\n\n- 00:04:25 \nAcquiring [[Phillip Danault]] is insurance on [[Quinton Byfield]], letting him develop on his own pace. They need the kids to take a step forward. [[Arthur Kaliyev]] is on the fourth line instead of the third, which is a problem for his develop.\n\n- 00:06:10 \nIs the 0-2 start the team in front of [[Jonathan Quick]], or is it him? \nQuick stated that he wanted to play beyond this contract, which was surprising. [[Cal Petersen]] needs to step up and show more. The Kings need to start looking beyond Quick. If he's the playoff goaltender, Quick needs to be well rested. The Kings need balance and options in goal. More consistency needed from Petersen.\n\n- 00:08:30\n[[Brandt Clarke]]'s start refreshing? Does he stay past 9 games?\n\"I told you so.\" He's exciting to watch and has the, \"It\" factor. [[Drew Doughty]] asked [[Rob Blake]] if he was going to be kept around. Mayor thinks Clarke will be around all season, but the World Juniors is the wildcard. They might make him available for the tournament. The Kings roster is overloaded with right-handed d-men. [[Jim Hiller]] and [[Trent Yawney]] will take a big role in developing him.\n\n- 00:12:05 \nWhat about that surplus if right-shot D? Will they wait until the trade deadline? Or sooner?\nThey need to understand what they have. Is [[Sean Walker]] tradeable? Can he be packaged? What about [[Jordan Spence]], who belongs in the NHL? The roster needs a chance to play together and figure things out. The team has a treasure chest of prospects, which was the goal. Even with Brock Faber traded in the [[Kevin Fiala]] deal, the team is overloaded on RHD. They need to make sure that [[Alex Edler]] isn't playing \u003e20 minutes a night or \u003e65 games played.\n\n- 00:14:35\nDid the Kings overachieve last year?\nMayor doesn't think so. He was actually disappointed that they didn't beat the Oilers in game 6. \n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/Nelson-Emerson":{"title":"Nelson Emerson","content":"\n# Nelson Emerson\n\nNHL.com | Twitter\n-|-\n[Nelson Emerson]() | [@twitter_handle](https://twitter.com/)\n\nTitle | Organization \n--- | ---\nAssistant General Manager | LA Kings\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\nDate | Title\n---|---\n\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\nDate | Title\n---|---\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/No-firm-Edler-Iafallo-updates-Everybody-wanted-to-win-it-for-Arvy":{"title":"No firm Edler, Iafallo updates - “Everybody wanted to win it for Arvy”","content":"\n# No firm Edler, Iafallo updates - “Everybody wanted to win it for Arvy”\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-17 | [[The Forum Report]] | [No firm Edler, Iafallo updates - “Everybody wanted to win it for Arvy”](https://theforumreport.com/no-firm-edler-iafallo-updates-everybody-wanted-to-win-it-for-arvy/) |\n| 2022-10-17 | [[The Forum Report]] | [[No firm Edler, Iafallo updates - “Everybody wanted to win it for Arvy”]]                                                                                              |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jon Rosen]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The foundation of Los Angeles’ 5-4 overtime win in Detroit was the club’s resilience and overall control of the game despite the general chaos of the universe shaking Little Caesars Arena like a snow globe.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Alex Edler]]\n- [[Sean Walker]]\n- [[Alex Iafallo]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n- [[Phillip Danault]]\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e Mentally, I don’t think there was really much time. Just go out there and let the body take over. Physically, I had about five minutes to roll out, stretch quickly. I skipped a little bit, and then it was ‘get ready.’ Definitely weird, but I think I handled it well and I’m happy with how the game turned out. -- [[Sean Walker]]\n\n\u003e I just wanted to make sure to score, and he made a great play. He backchecked hard and stripped me, and right when I shot it, he got his stick on it, so it was a good play by him. -- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n\n\u003e Everybody wanted to win it for Arvy. You can see a lot of guys going over and tapping him, saying, ‘hey, no problem, we’ve got this,’ and that’s how it ended. But we shouldn’t want to be doing that too often, putting ourselves in that situation. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e Obviously Edler didn’t play, and that’s never a good sign, so we’ll see how he is in the morning, and I don’t have an update for you yet on Iafallo. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e We know it was not acceptable the last couple games, so definitely it was a little better tonight. -- [[Phillip Danault]]\n\n\u003e This was the first game I felt like myself again, so it was a good step in the right direction, I think. -- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n\n\u003e Great play by him to get out of there quickly. There were four guys on the blue line, I think, so it was a great heads up play and a great pass by Mooresy. -- [[Phillip Danault]]\n\n\u003e Well, we yelled at Sean Walker to get his equipment on. No warm-up, and he played. That’s all you can do. The game plan doesn’t change because one guy goes down. Next man up, and that’s how it happened. And for me … that may be the best way for him to go in and play. No thinking, just go play the game. His ability to come back from the injury not having played for a long, long time, I thought tonight he did an admirable job under difficult circumstances, yet it may have favored him. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e It was five minutes into warm-ups. I was kind of just hanging out in the back. I heard Eds took a puck somewhere and just to be ready, so I started my warm-up there and that was kind of it, then. Just got ready and got out there. Not the usual routine and everything, but I think I handled it well. -- [[Sean Walker]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/October-11-Lineup-notes-Fiala-Kopitar-Kempe-buddies-Clarke-debut-to-wait":{"title":"October 11 - Lineup notes - Fiala, Kopitar, Kempe buddies - Clarke debut to wait","content":"\n# October 11 - Lineup notes - Fiala, Kopitar, Kempe buddies - Clarke debut to wait\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-11 | [[The Forum Report]] | [October 11 - Lineup notes - Fiala, Kopitar, Kempe buddies - Clarke debut to wait](https://theforumreport.com/2022/10/11/october-11-lineup-notes-fiala-kopitar-kempe-buddies-clarke-debut-to-wait/)\n2022-10-11 | [[The Forum Report]] | [[October 11 - Lineup notes - Fiala, Kopitar, Kempe buddies - Clarke debut to wait]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jon Rosen]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings are 22-21-2 in their 54 season openers with nine ties, defeating Vegas 6-2 at home last year behind a hat trick and five points from Anze Kopitar, and a goal and three assists from Drew Doughty.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e What’s happened this year is opening night’s come pretty quickly for us There are teams that don’t play ‘til Friday, or they have a whole week of practice ahead of them.

A pleasant game day to you from underneath the marine layer in El Segundo. This is still the marine layer, correct? With the recent thunderstorms and this summer’s humidity and mosquitoes I am concerned our beautiful Mediterranean climate is being overtaken by Florida and it’s not always easy to tell. This has little to do with tonight’s LA Kings – Seattle Kraken game (7:30 pm / Bally Sports West / ESPN+ / LA Kings Audio Network), which was preceded by an optional morning skate at TSPC.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e It’s going to be a big moment and it’s going to be really exciting, but after I get that first shift I think I’ll just settle in, do what I do, just play hockey again and it’s just another game, I think.  -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e I thought last year that that Seattle team had developed an identity at being pretty quick and then on top of you. I saw that again last night. They didn’t give you a lot of time and space to maneuver, to make long thinking plays. You’ve got to be connected and quick to play against them. They’ve got a big, heavy back end that defends well. Obviously, their power play was very good last night. They’ve added a significant chunk of offensive talent to their team. They’ll be a tough team to have not only for us, but for 30 other teams.  -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e It wasn’t planned that way. I think the less he has on his mind and more instinctual hockey, the better he has for success.  -- [[Todd McLellan]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/On-the-eve-of-the-2022-23-season-Kings-leadership-expecting-progress-from-increased-expectations-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"On the eve of the 2022-23 season, Kings leadership expecting progress from increased expectations - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# On the eve of the 2022-23 season, Kings leadership expecting progress from increased expectations - LA Kings Insider\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-10 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [On the eve of the 2022-23 season, Kings leadership expecting progress from increased expectations - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/10/on-the-eve-of-the-2022-23-season-kings-leadership-expecting-progress-from-increased-expectations/)\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n- [[Drew Doughty]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Rob Blake]]\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e “Progress. Continued progress.”\n\u003e That was Rob Blake’s generalized answer to what he would see as growth from last season to this season.\n\u003e Throughout last season, [[Rob Blake|Blake]] maintained that word, progress. It was never, publicly at least, about setting a bar or a line for what the team needed to achieve, there wasn’t a mandate as to what progress was, but rather just a focus on the word. Progress.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e Progress. Continued progress. -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\u003e We’ve made a big step getting back in the playoffs and now you’ve got to hold that level and keep getting in. I think the roster starts to take a little more shape, you add a few pieces through free agency, give the young guys a couple more years to get up and running at the NHL level and now you put the emphasis on them producing and helping us. -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\u003e I would say it’s tougher going from once you become a playoff team to be able to become a real contender. Now you’re dealing with really, really good teams once you get in. We made a step last year, but now we have to make sure we have the ability to move past that and keep that going. I think Todd used the phrase ‘we’re not sneaking up on anybody’. Not anymore. I think our coaching staff will have our players prepared for that. -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\u003e Last year was a big step for this team and for some individuals and the team in general, but now we have to upgrade it again. Yeah, it was great to make the playoffs of course but making the playoffs is not the goal here. It’s doing some damage in the playoffs, but in order to do that, it’s getting there first and then roll from there. -- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\n\u003e You’re never the finished product on day one. I think I’ve mentioned to a few guys that day one is often too high or too low and day two is really where you start to see what the team is made of. We’re at day one, we’re going to make it important because it obviously is. We’d like to see our identity come out, we’d like to see our structure come out, we’d like to see individuals find their game within our game. There are areas that we’ve concentrated a little bit more on through training camp and we should see improvements in those areas, but it will take some time. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e There are a bunch of guys in here that have gone through a bunch of camps, so I think everybody’s looking to a day like today, where we’re working towards tomorrow. We are in a good spot and we’re in good spirits for the start of the season. -- [[Drew Doughty]]\n\n\u003e It’s getting there. I think there are less and less concerns throughout the lineup. I think there still are at different times and that there will be as the season goes on, but I do think we have players that can fill certain roles. We do have some depth in the right positions if needed, that was a major factor last year that I’m not sure we had set and understood well enough with major injuries Some of these guys were able to step in and play those minutes. -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\u003e Expectations, there’s a lot that goes with it and I think we have to define within our interior walls what we expect out of this group,” Blake said. “Building and getting better, every time we’re on the ice, we have to get better. We’ve got to get our special teams better, a lot of areas of our game need to increase from a year ago to keep that level. Those are the expectations and we’ve talked to the players and it’s from within. We’ve defined that on a personal level and on a team level, there are expectations that we want these guys to meet. -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/Ontario-Reign":{"title":"Ontario Reign","content":"\n# Ontario Reign\n\nLA Kings affiliate in the [[AHL]].;;\n\n[[Kings Prospects on the Ontario Reign]]\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/Ontario-Reign-Opening-Night-Lineup-vs-Abbotsford-Canucks":{"title":"Ontario Reign - Opening Night Lineup vs Abbotsford Canucks","content":"\n# Ontario Reign - Opening Night Lineup vs Abbotsford Canucks\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-14 | [[Mayors Manor]] | [Ontario Reign - Opening Night Lineup vs Abbotsford Canucks](https://mayorsmanor.com/2022/10/ontario-reign-opening-night-lineup-vs-abbotsford-canucks/)\n2022-10-14 | [[Mayors Manor]] | [[Ontario Reign - Opening Night Lineup vs Abbotsford Canucks]]\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Scott Coffman]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[T.J.

This is his first professional head coaching job.\n- Before the Kings and [[Ontario Reign|Reign]] training camp, Sturm and his staff ran the [[2022 Rookie Camp]].\n\n\u003e We’ve had some excellent practices this week. I thought the guys have been really really good. I think we’re getting better every day and we’ve worked on a lot of things this week system wise, the way we want to play and it was a lot of information for the guys but they’re doing really good so I’m really pleased with the effort so far. -- [[Marco Sturm]]\n\n\u003e It’s been a really exciting week for me and I think everyone else in the locker room too. They all want to play. It’s been a long summer, it’s been a long camp including the Kings camp so I think everyone wants to play now. -- [[Marco Sturm]]\n\n\u003e I feel great. It’s a good feeling to be back after four months so I’m just enjoying every moment here and I can’t wait for the season to start. -- [[Martin Chromiak]]\n\n\u003e It was a great experience to play a preseason game,” said Chromiak.”I learned a lot from those older guys and NHL players so I just want to take a lot from them and from the coaches and do my best. -- [[Martin Chromiak]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/Ontario-Reign-on-Youtube":{"title":"Ontario Reign on Youtube","content":"\n# Ontario Reign on Youtube\n\nURL | Feed | Twitter\n-|-|-\n[Ontario Reign](https://www.youtube.com/c/OntarioReignAHL) | [Feed]() | [@twitterHandle](https://twitter.com/) \n\n\n## Articles\n| Title | Source Link | Date Published |\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/Otto-Salin":{"title":"Otto Salin","content":"\n# Otto Salin\n\n| EliteProspects | Twitter                                 |\n| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| [Otto Salin](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/638727/otto-salin)           | [@twitter_handle](https://twitter.com/) | \n\n| Player         | \\#  | Position | Shoots | Height | Weight | Born       | Birthplace    | Draft                        |\n| -------------- | --- | -------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ---------- | ------------- | ---------------------------- |\n| [[Otto Salin]] | 41  | D        | R      | 5' 11\" | 187    | 2004-03-07 | Helsinki, FIN | LAK 5th Rd 2022, 148 overall | \n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n|      |      |       |\n\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n|      |      |       |\n\n\n\n## Post-Draft Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n|      |      |       |\n\n\n\n## Pre-Draft Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n|      |      |       |\n\n\n## Unprocessed Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n|      |      |       |\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/PRESEASON-FINAL-Kings-1-Sharks-3-Doughty-Villalta-McLellan":{"title":"PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 1, Sharks 3 – Doughty, Villalta, McLellan","content":"\n# PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 1, Sharks 3 – Doughty, Villalta, McLellan\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-09-28 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 1, Sharks 3 – Doughty, Villalta, McLellan](http://lakingsinsider.com/2022/09/28/preseason-final-kings-1-sharks-3-doughty-villalta-mclellan/)\n2022-09-28 | [[LA Kings Insider]] |  [[PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 1, Sharks 3 – Doughty, Villalta, McLellan]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Drew Doughty]]\n- [[Matthew Villalta]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings suffered their first regulation defeat of the preseason, by a 3-1 margin on Wednesday evening at Toyota Arena in Ontario.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Drew Doughty]]\n\u003e Total, I’ll probably play three or four, so a couple more after this one. I could already play regular-season games.\n\n\u003e It definitely took a little bit of the competitive edge out of the game and yeah, definitely the flow, you’re sitting down on the bench and you lose your legs. You saw guys start going out, twirling around, but you’re still not skating, you’re just twirling around. It’s not something you want to happen as a player.\n\n\u003e I think he’s a great player, he sees the ice very well, he makes very good plays, I can’t say enough about his offensive ability. He can learn a little bit on the other side of the puck, but who couldn’t when you come in as an offensive defenseman. I went through the same stuff, I had to learn how to play defense and we’ve got a lot of good guys on our team who can help teach him. I don’t want to say he’s NHL ready, but he’s basically NHL ready.\n\n### [[Matthew Villalta]]\n\u003e Yeah, that was the first one ever for me so very exciting. Bill let me know yesterday during practice that I’d be starting tonight, so obviously a very exciting opportunity to wear the Kings jersey down here in Ontario in front of all of our fans, it was very special. I just wanted to go in there and do the best job I could. As the game went on, it felt better and better and I feel like I adjusted to the pace and got my game speed back, which I wanted to do earlier off the scrimmages we had during camp. I think, all in all, we would have liked to get the win, especially in front of our fans here, but sometimes that’s the way it goes, it’s hockey. Other than that I thought it was a good day.\n\n\u003e 100%. We had a really good crowd tonight and I definitely heard them. Like I said yesterday, anytime you get to play here in the Inland Empire, it’s a treat to play in front of our fans and you want to go out there and try and give them the best show you can. It was very exciting and I think \\[the fans here] have a lot to be excited about this year.\n\n\u003e I think the biggest thing is just game intensity, especially for not playing all summer. Going into camp you try to ramp that up, maybe a few weeks before camp and obviously it takes a few scrimmages and practices to really get it back and feel comfortable. It’s a fun challenge definitely. When you get up here in the NHL preseason, there are a lot of skilled players, they’re elite, they make plays happen real quick, tape to tape passes and shooters are pretty accurate. It was a real good challenge and a lot of fun.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e I can’t remember three panes of glass in one game, but it’s good for us to come out here. We have good, loyal fans in this part of the country and they support our minor league team very well. Yeah, it wasn’t the best night in terms of ice conditions, or obviously the glass, the momentum of the game and the ability to evaluate it, but it still meant something for us to come here. It’s important that we did that.\n\n\u003eJust keep on playing him, he’s getting tested every night. Different elements, different factors, different teams. He played in Vegas the other night in a sold out building, coming here and trying to figure out all of the momentum stuff in a game, fatigue setting in a bit for him, so he’s getting tested. He’s earned a very valuable off day tomorrow and he’ll pick back up with the rest of the group tomorrow.\n\n\u003e It was nice to see number eight back out there. One, it’s great to see him back out there. He’s got enthusiasm, he’s excited to play so he was trying to find his game. It’s been a while since he’s played and that was tough night to do it. Even for us, we can’t really evaluate real well. We’ll look at where players were going, but the ice conditions were terrible and the ability to connect passes and stuff wasn’t very good and that’s Drew’s game. He got a sweat and he got to play around players get physical, which was great.\n\n\u003e It’s huge for both of them. We tried to split the night, knowing that Moore and Danault were playing, so we tried to split the night with [[Samuel Fagemo|Sammy Fagemo]] and [[Gabe Vilardi|Gabe]]. Was it fair to them, I don’t know, it’s a tough evaluator, I wish it was perfect conditions. They both played well.","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/PRESEASON-FINAL-Kings-2-Ducks-1-Walker-Vilardi-McLellan":{"title":"PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 2, Ducks 1 – Walker, Vilardi, McLellan","content":"\n# PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 2, Ducks 1 – Walker, Vilardi, McLellan\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-02 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 2, Ducks 1 – Walker, Vilardi, McLellan](http://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/02/preseason-final-kings-2-ducks-1-walker-vilardi-mclellan/)\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Sean Walker]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings earned their second victory of the preseason with a 2-1 victory over the Anaheim Ducks on Sunday evening at Crypto.com Arena.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### Gabe Vilardi\n\u003eYeah, I agree with that. I think similar to last year, we’ve got to start finding ways to score more goals, but definitely the chances were there. If you put up 40 shots, every game but only score two goals, some nights like tonight, maybe it’ll win games but other nights, teams are going to score more than two goals. Quickie played great, we’ve just got to find ways to score goals however that is.\n\n\u003e In all honesty, it’s not a lot of me out there, I’m in front of the net and I’m really just trying to create attention and try to find that that backdoor space. But yeah, they were moving around really fast and I’m in more of a recover the puck mode, just trying to create space for other guys by being almost like a distraction and bringing guys in. You kind of saw that on Juice’s goal today, I guess. We’ve been working on that and I actually really liked it, it looks good.\n\n\u003e We’ve got three lefties out there, I’m the only righty \\[among the forwards]. It’s hockey at the end of the day and you’ve got to read the play and gain possession before position, so you’ve got to have the puck before you can go into roles and spots. It helps having Kevin and Juice, who are very similar players I think in terms of half-wall capabilities and one timing the puck. It’s easy for them to switch.\n\n### Todd McLellan\n\u003e Yeah, I thought in phases of the game it did. Not so much early, second period yes and as the night went on, I thought you could see more of our game coming together, the pieces systematically but also just the tenacity of the forecheck and the way we’re playing and maybe that’s a good sign for us. Special teams we’ve had a little bit of work on now, we saw some production from them, both penalty kill and power play, so that’s a good sign. But I would say yeah, closer to our identity.\n\n\u003e 5-on-5 we’re not getting enough done offensively, I think, in exhibition season so far. We haven’t held onto pucks in sustained attack time until tonight, tonight was the first night where we actually got it going for a little while. Some polish around the net seems to always be what we’re looking for and that has to be there again. I would say throughout the exhibition season it’s slowly been improving. Tonight, it got closer to what we’ve what we wanted offensively. Defensively, knock on wood, we haven’t given up much and when we have the goaltenders have been there for us. Work in progress, like every other team.\n\n\u003e There were some concepts that we’re trying to bring in. Let’s face it, we’ve probably had 20 minutes of power-play time really, and discussions and meetings, so we can’t get it all done at once. The one thing that we did have was a lot of the pieces to a unit tonight in the lineup. That’s one of the difficult things as a team or as a staff, is when a lot of guys are still trying out for the team, you never really get your full units and or your penalty kill pairs. I hope that will start to happen this week.\n\n\u003e I couldn’t be happier for that guy. I’m talking about an exhibition game, it sounds like we’re in game seven, but for what he’s gone through, to claw his way back. He got better as the night went on I really thought. His first period was his tough period, it was happening fast but he got into the game quickly. If he’s feeling good and the leg is feeling good, we’ll keep playing him and try to get him up and running. A good first night for him.\n\n\u003e Leadership isn’t always when you’re in the lineup, it’s what you do to get back for your teammates too.

It was good to get my feet wet and now on to the next one.\n\n\u003e A lot of it is traffic stuff, guys are driving to the net, trying to get in your way so you can’t see and obviously the intensity gets ramped up in these games. I’d say the intensity and traffic are the two biggest things that kind of changed from summer skates and the scrimmages in camp.\n\n\u003e Yeah, I mean I knew I was going in at some point a second \\[period] so just 10 minutes earlier, it is what it is, just a little sooner than I thought. At the same time, it’s kind of just “I’ve got to get in there and do my thing.”\n\n\u003e Yeah, definitely, that’s part of the job, you have to be ready when that happens and you have to go in and you’re there for the team. That’s just part of the gig.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e I think tonight was an easier game for us to evaluate. We got to see more players in common situations. Penalty kill and power play, those are situations where the bench gets shortened and we haven’t had any work on them yet. 5-on-5, we did some good things, we did some things that we’ve actually worked on poorly, so we have to fix some areas of our game. Still, it’s back-to-back in the exhibition season, game two, there’s things we can be happy with and then there’s part of the game that we have to fix.\n\n\u003e Well, he doesn’t need many opportunities, I don’t think, to score. He had very few chances, yet he scored a goal and set up a nice one in overtime. Obviously the offensive instincts are there. I think it’s going to take them some time to gel as a line and figure each other out, figure out how we’re going to play the game as a group. It won’t be any different than Phil Danault when he arrived last year, it took him four or five games just to figure everything out, but we’re excited about having him here and he seems to be fitting in real well.\n\n\u003e Well, you draw a few things on the board, you show a few video clips and you hope that it works. That’s why training camp is two weeks long and then you get some practice time to begin the season. We’ve got a practice, then we play on Wednesday again, so we’ll try and add an element to our game tomorrow that skate. That could very well be a piece of either the power play or the penalty kill and see if we can implement it on Wednesday.\n\n\u003e Phoenix knew he was going in today, we were going to split the night as it was and after the first, Cal didn’t feel real good. He went in and knowing you’re going in at that point may give you a better chance to prepare even. He loosened up, he got ready between periods and when he went in, I thought he played very well in the last 40 minutes.\n\n\u003e He felt something and instead of pushing him through it, it makes no sense. We’ll evaluate him and we’ll see where he is tomorrow.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/PRESEASON-FINAL-Kings-2-Sharks-3-OT-McLellan-takeaways-+-Clarke-preseason-debut-and-notes":{"title":"PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 2, Sharks 3 OT – McLellan takeaways + Clarke preseason debut and notes","content":"\n# PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 2, Sharks 3 OT – McLellan takeaways + Clarke preseason debut and notes\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-09-25 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 2, Sharks 3 OT – McLellan takeaways + Clarke preseason debut and notes](http://lakingsinsider.com/2022/09/25/preseason-final-kings-2-sharks-3-ot-mclellans-takeaways-clarkes-preseason-debut-notes/)\n2022-09-25 | [[LA Kings Insider]] |  [[PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 2, Sharks 3 OT – McLellan takeaways + Clarke preseason debut and notes]] \n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jared Shafran]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n- [[Jonathan Quick]]\n- [[Carl Grundstrom]]\n\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings came up short in their first game of the 2022 preseason, falling in overtime to the San Jose Sharks by a score of 3-2 at the SAP Center on Sunday evening.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e Well, the flow part didn’t exist for both teams. It was a long night, a lot of penalties. Obviously, we’ve got to get better in some areas as far as stick infractions and holding and hooking and use our legs a little bit more, but if they’re ever going to call a lot, now’s a good time for it. I thought the penalties took a lot of players out of the game for us particularly early, but even in the second period on the power play, it took a lot of players away. Tough night to evaluate. Some guys were noticeably good and as always, there’s a couple of disappointments but for night one, we’re fairly pleased.\n\n\u003e Well, he’s got a lot of experience and he trained quite hard over the summer. So he’s been on the ice for a while now. I believe his body probably felt really good. He was tracking the puck well, it’s a lot to ask right off the bat, but if anybody can do it, he can and he proved again, he could get it done.\n\n\u003e A lot of the things that we thought we would. Poised with the puck, good playmaking, read the ice well, for him it’ll be getting acclimatized to heavier forechecks, perhaps some craftier, smarter players on the forecheck that are reading where the puck might go to. More time on the power play of course. We haven’t even talked about power play yet, we just put guys out and let them play. But I thought overall, he handled his minutes well and had an impact on the game.\n\n\u003e We get to choose our lineup. It doesn’t matter who dresses what, we’re evaluating our players and the fact that we got to play against a pretty good team tonight was good for us. It was a big challenge for our players and a good evaluation tool for us. But the veterans on both teams are managing themselves. They’re trying to get themselves ready, they know how long the season is, and I think it’s sometimes misleading when you look at number of veterans in the lineup versus rookies.\n\n\u003e It was, he had a tough first period, simply because of minutes and flow and rhythm, but as the game wore on he did the things he needed to do. He played in straight lines, he was physical player and got to the blue paint, which is an area of the game I didn’t think we did a real good job of but he was one that did get there.\n\n\n### [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\u003e It was fun. It’s cool to see the superstars on their team, see quality NHLers all over the ice. They’re bringing it. They’re getting warm for the season and they’re bringing their best they can and it’s challenging but I thought I tried to step it up in the second and third. Definitely some nerves in the first, maybe I was gripping the stick a little too tight but I thought I got more comfortable throughout the game and I thought I was making more plays and I was pretty satisfied with how the second half of my game went.\n\n\u003e Definitely, the first was pretty much all killing and the second was all on the man-advantage. It’s a big swing there, you gotta get adjusted and get ready for both sides. But you know, I thought we did a good job, we were phenomenal on the kill today. We didn’t even give them any shots and our power play was pretty good too. If you look at our shots we probably had like 15. I’m not even seeing the numbers but I’m guessing. Would have been nice to bury a couple and I think we had a couple of really quality chances and we were definitely pretty happy with our shifts when we came off at times but when you look at a zero in the goal column there it’s frustrating even when we know we had some really high quality looks.\n\n\u003e Oh, he’s an absolute rock. It’s crazy seeing all the highlights on TV but you know it’s so much more calming when he’s actually back there and especially there was a lot of nerves for a lot of us today but he was so calm, cool and collected back there. He was making the big save, they had a really high quality chance eight seconds of the game and he was he was up for the challenge. You can just tell he’s a pro and he’s always ready for any moment. He definitely kept us in it. They could have put up three, four or five maybe in the first period but he held it to one and we’re really grateful for that to give us a chance in the game.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/PRESEASON-FINAL-Kings-4-Ducks-5-Vilardi-Edler-McLellan":{"title":"PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 4, Ducks 5 – Vilardi, Edler, McLellan","content":"\n# PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 4, Ducks 5 – Vilardi, Edler, McLellan\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n 2022-10-04   | [[LA Kings Insider]]  | [PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 4, Ducks 5 – Vilardi, Edler, McLellan](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/04/preseason-final-kings-4-ducks-5-vilardi-edler-mclellan/)\n\n## Contributors:\n- [[Jared Shafran]]\n\n## Players\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Alex Edler]]\n- [[Cal Petersen]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings had their highest offensive output of the preseason Tuesday night in Anaheim, but were unable to hold a pair of two-goal leads and came up short to the Ducks at the Honda Center, losing 5-4.\n\n## Notes\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]] - 2 goals\n- [[Arthur Kaliyev]]  - 1 goal\n- [[Tobias Bjornfot]] - 1 goal\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e Some good evidence that’s what you’re always looking for as a coach. I thought we started well and our game grew as the night went on. Got the lead into the midway point of the second and similarly to the game in in LA the other night, started to give it back a little bit and took four penalties in a row. That didn’t help; two of them were in the offensive zone. And then I didn’t like our overall team engine. We made mental mistakes and is that because of fatigue or is it because of shift length? That played a role in that as well.\n\n\u003e I think it’s starting to happen, yeah. And that’s that evidence that we’re looking for. There’s guys that are elevating their games, there’s some that are falling off and showing maybe they’re not quite ready and then there’s some that we’re waiting for. And I think the ones that are elevating are great. The ones that are falling off, that happens. The ones we’re waiting for are the ones that have to get going. In fairness to them, some have only played two games. For whatever approach each team takes to training camp and how many games different guys get, we’re five games in and we’ve had key players that have only played two nights. We’ve got two more games coming up and we’ll try and get them in as much as we possibly can and we have to take that into consideration but a lot of teams in the league are like that too.\n\n\u003e Well, one it looks like he’s having a lot of fun and I think that’s a huge part of it so give him credit for being enthusiastic and being excited and his teammates love playing with him right now that’s a real good sign. The way he’s using his body to protect pucks and keep plays alive. Power play, we’ve given him a bit of a new role and he’s accepting of that and he seems to be in command of it. There’s a lot of positives from [[Gabe Vilardi]].\n\n\u003e Yeah, we kept some plays alive, we were in a position where we needed to be, we had some looks to the net. I think we won a face-off and we didn’t get through the goaltenders eyes which, at six-on-five, you better have somebody going through those eyes. So that was a disappointment, but the general structure for not having worked on it very much or at all was a carryover from last year and they did a good job there.\n\n### [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n\u003e Yeah it was a 5-4 game so a lot of goals, a lot of power plays, PKs, so obviously that’s going to create more opportunities. We’ve got to find ways to score goals so I mean it’s a good thing but we didn’t come out on the right end of it.\n\n\u003e I’m playing the net-front, moving around, I’m just kind of reading off them and I’m trying to find open areas back door kind of like I did on the first goal there. Yeah, I’m comfortable there, just kind of tapped into them and just trying to get open on that back side.\n\n\u003e Very good stick. Like it’s a very high skill level that I don’t know if it’s undercover like very hard to see but when I play with him you really notice how good his stick is, how many pucks he tips, how any pucks are going out of the zone and he somehow knocks it out of the air and then he’s just a very smart player so it makes it easier on everyone he’s playing with when you’re playing with smart guys. -- on [[Phillip Danault]]\n\n### [[Alex Edler]]\n\u003e We’re all trying to get ready for the season and trying to find out game, trying to find the chemistry and trying to execute our game plan and that’s what we have to continue to work on.\n\n\u003e I think we’re all pretty clear on what our game is and what we need to do and we showed a lot last year and what made us successful so that’s just what we’ve got to do.\n\n\u003e Yeah, I mean it’s been a while since I was in that kind of situation. So it was fun, it was fun to be out there and be part of it. Too bad we couldn’t get one.\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/PRESEASON-FINAL-Kings-4-Golden-Knights-6-Kempe-Durzi-McLellan":{"title":"PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 4, Golden Knights 6 – Kempe, Durzi, McLellan","content":"\n# PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 4, Golden Knights 6 – Kempe, Durzi, McLellan\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n 2022-10-07   | [[LA Kings Insider]]  | [PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 4, Golden Knights 6 – Kempe, Durzi, McLellan](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/06/preseason-final-kings-4-golden-knights-6-kempe-durzi-mclellan/)\n\n## Contributors:\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n## Players\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n- [[Sean Durzi]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings fell by a 6-4 final in their second to last game of the preseason, the annual Frozen Fury tilt in Salt Lake City.\n\n## Notes\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]] scored his third goal in the last two pre-season games.\n\n### [[Adrian Kempe]]\n\u003e I think it’s been getting better and better. I think the power play has been good ever since the first game. Five on five, I feel like we’ve been getting better and better throughout the preseason. We had some ups and downs tonight, but overall we had some good looks, obviously scored one goal and one goal that they couldn’t see was in. I think that’s something positive to build on, tough that we lost but I think it’s going in the right direction.\n\n\u003e Yeah, I think both units have been doing great on power play. We have got some structure to it, we have guys who can play everywhere, we have a lot of players who can shoot the puck. We changed up some things from previous years and it’s working so far. You’ve got to be prepared, when season starts. team’s are going to be scouting, they’re going to know what we’re going to do, so we’ll need some other plans. I think overall right now it’s looking good.\n\n\u003e I mean, go back tomorrow and look at what we could have done better tonight. I think overall, our game is coming together. Still a couple of parts in the game where we can get better but overall, I think we played two good periods tonight and we needed to play three to beat this team or any team in the league. There’s those couple of things, but I think we’re moving in the right direction and we’re happy.\n\n### [[Sean Durzi]]\n\u003e Yeah, at the beginning of the game, I mean I was pretty fired up for the game. Even though it’s an exhibition, it was a lot of excitement, a lot of energy, it felt great to be out there with the guys again competing. I probably wanted a little bit of a better game, that’s just the way it goes.\n\n\u003e Yeah, right away, it’s defensive communication with my teammates and making reads in the d-zone. It happens quick, especially after not playing and coming right into it. Talking to guys, you want to make that switch a little quicker, give them a little less time and I think I was just a step slow with my reads, but I’m going to work at it, it’s just reps, talking about teammates and going over the video. It’s getting back into that groove and being hard on myself but learning from it. We don’t have much time here, so I’ve got to get going.\n\n\u003e Although it’s an exhibition game, we’re here to win and I think as a team that’s important to approach every single game the same way and know what our identity is, build our identity and trust it. Quite honestly, it’s what preseason is for, it’s what you practice for, it’s how you play. For the team, it’s like I said just sticking together and playing for each other. Personally, I got first game under my belt tonight and like I said, making reads, talking to my teammates, getting used to playing with them again.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e Yes and no, I don’t think it’s ever complete because there are guys that elevate, guys that fall off. The best thing that I can tell you is that there’s a group that we’re really happy with and there’s a group where a lot of them aren’t here anymore, there’s still a few that aren’t quite going to get it done. That’s just the way it is, not everybody can play. Our big concern is that middle group, what are they going to do and when are they going to do it? We’ve got three or four days left here before we’ve got to play that team again. Obviously, both clubs are going to get better, they’re going to put different players in the lineup but we’ve given up 10 goals in the last six periods we played. That’s not who we are and that’s not how we should be playing.\n\n\u003e It’s a little bit of both, the lineups have gotten stronger and on one side of the coin, we’ve been able to score a lot more and I think sometimes when that’s begins to happen, you forget who you are, you want to get out and, everybody wants to be a goal scorer. There were situations on the rink today, where we had to decide whether we were going to be on the North or the South side of the puck and players that normally would make good decisions in those situations chose the wrong side. I know they’re better than that and that’s why we’re waiting for them. They’ve got to make these decisions now instead of seven, eight, ten games into the season, when they realize it’s a little bit too late. So, not much we can do, we’re counting on them, we trust that they will. One more game to prep and then away we go.\n\n\u003e It’s amazing what can happen in two weeks. Players get their legs underneath them, they get a sense of timing, they have some spacial awareness on the ice. When players are coming at them, it starts to speed up a little bit and [[Sean Durzi]] is jumping in at that point, that’s going to be the same thing with [[Viktor Arvidsson]]. It’s not an easy thing to do, but I thought he did some good things on one side of the puck and others that he has to sharpen up.\n\n\u003e Yeah, you know what, every time we come here, the fanbase here in Salt Lake City is a really good hockey one. It’s not just a basketball city or a college city, it’s a hockey city. From what I hear, the minor hockey programs are really strong, the game is growing and to have that type of crowd turnout and cheer for their favorite team, it’s really important. We appreciate them.\n\n ","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/PRESEASON-FINAL-Kings-6-Ducks-3-Arvidsson-Kaliyev-McLellan":{"title":"PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 6, Ducks 3 – Arvidsson, Kaliyev, McLellan","content":"\n# PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 6, Ducks 3 – Arvidsson, Kaliyev, McLellan\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n 2022-10-08   |   | [PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 6, Ducks 3 – Arvidsson, Kaliyev, McLellan](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/08/preseason-final-kings-6-ducks-3-arvidsson-kaliyev-mclellan/)\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n## Players\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n- [[Arthur Kaliyev]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings capped off the preseason with a 6-3 victory over the Anaheim Ducks on Saturday afternoon at Crypto.com Arena.\n\n## Notes\n### [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n\u003eIt was good. A little bit excited and a little nervous too, after being hurt, coming off of the surgery and the injury, but it was fun. It was awesome to be back on the bench and to get back into the game.\n\n\u003e Yeah, absolutely. It was so good to be back, it was good to just be with my teammates and around my teammates for the last week. Just being able to practice with them again and now play, it’s been really good.\n\n\u003e Absolutely. It doesn’t matter who I play with, but us three as a line have been so good with each other, both on and off the ice, in practices and during the games. It obviously helps a lot.\n\n### [[Arthur Kaliyev]]\n\u003e Just playing hard everywhere, winning battles and making plays, I’m not thinking about just scoring, but it just comes along with it. You get your chances from just playing hard everywhere.\n\n\u003e Whatever is open, I just try to find open space \\[in the offensive zone]. Whether it’s closer to the net or farther away, wherever there is open ice, I’m just trying to find that space.\n\n\u003e We have a lot of intensity on that unit, good puck movement and we’ve gotten a lot of shots on net, which has created a lot of rebounds. It’s been good and hopefully we can keep it going into the regular season.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e The first period was probably our best first period of the preseason. Often, when you start with a power play right off the bat, it can dictate where that period goes and our power play was strong at that point. It helped us to get on our toes and get going. The game as a whole, I thought we gave it back a little bit in the second period. It started with a power play, the penalties are a common theme, but the third was a pretty good lockdown period.\n\n\u003eWe’ve spent some time, still not enough, working on some concepts, changing a few things. They are grasping the ideas and now it’s about execution, we’ve seen some good movement. The one thing that we can’t help them with is the finish, and we had a couple of open nets that we double-clutched or missed. Hopefully that comes more naturally as time goes on.\n\n\u003e It was \\[important] and we treated at least the first 50 minutes of it trying to get a few matches, trying to game simulate what the regular season will feel like. Play the top lines a little bit more, get their minutes up to see what that feels like and then down the stretch, when we got that lead, we pulled back as we would maybe in the regular season and got our third and fourth lines out, who I thought played a really good, solid game for those six players. It felt more like the regular season.\n\n\u003e Pretty rewarding, same comment as we had with Sean Walker. [[Viktor Arvidsson|Arvi]] means a lot to our team, he completes the identity of that Danault and Moore line. I thought, of all the players we had coming back who had some sort of injury, he had probably the most energy and polish. Perhaps that’s because we played a full lineup too, but he had a good night. He told me on the bench he felt good, we tried to run him a little bit more down the stretch. A couple of good practices coming up and hopefully he’s ready to play in the real matches.\n\n\u003e There’s some positives from tonight, the win, the power play at certain points looked good, the penalty kill did its job, but you’re asking me more about roster spots, who’s going and who’s staying. I don’t know that the plan is going to change a lot based on tonight’s game. I obviously had zero time to sit down with Blakey and his staff, we’re only 10 minutes since the game ended.

It could’ve been a three-goal deficit, and that’s a tough one to come back from.\n\n\u003e We got an outstanding effort by our goaltender and we still had a chance to win – had a chance for a point, really – but obviously the focus is going to be on the play at the end, which makes no sense. It’s hard to defend it, but our team gave up 51 shots on goal tonight. And when you look at the night, the first goal against, just terrible game management coming out of the penalty box and not being aware. The second one’s on the back end of a power play. You have to rewind the video a little bit. We were on the power play, we negated it with an offensive zone penalty, so terrible game management there. Third one, an actual power play, and the fourth one was actual stupidity. So a lot of it was self-inflicted. But you have to give them a lot of credit – they put a lot of pressure on us and created a lot of turnovers and a lot of pressure on our net, so we’ve got work to do.\n\n\u003e Knowing where the puck is coming out of the penalty box on a line change. You’ve got to be aware of that. Missing the net on that play. The end, a set breakout that we work on all the time. You’ve got numerous options. So that is all game management – that’s getting engaged and ready to go. Their team did a better job of it than we did tonight.\n\n### [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n\u003e I thought we were good in the first and third. There wasn’t much flow in the second – a lot of penalties. It was a weird period. I felt we had one shift every 10 minutes just because of penalties and stuff like that. But yeah, we’re good when we get in the O-zone. We ‘ve just got to keep doing the things in the D-zone. And once we get in the O-zone, [[Alex Iafallo|A.I.]]’s a really hard working guy, very smart, hungry … and [[Quinton Byfield|Q]] is pretty gifted with the puck, too. So, we’ve just got to get to the O-zone.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/Practice-10-12-Identity-Through-3-Periods-+-Notes-on-Vilardis-Speed-Fourth-Goal-Looking-Ahead-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"Practice 10-12 - Identity Through 3 Periods + Notes on Vilardis Speed, Fourth Goal, Looking Ahead - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# Practice 10-12 - Identity Through 3 Periods + Notes on Vilardis Speed, Fourth Goal, Looking Ahead - LA Kings Insider\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-12 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [Practice 10-12 - Identity Through 3 Periods + Notes on Vilardi's Speed, Fourth Goal, Looking Ahead - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/12/practice-10-12-identity-through-3-periods-notes-on-vilardis-speed-fourth-goal-looking-ahead/)\n2022-10-12 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[Practice 10-12 - Identity Through 3 Periods + Notes on Vilardis Speed, Fourth Goal, Looking Ahead - LA Kings Insider]]\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Alex Iafallo]]\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003eThe Kings hit the ice this morning for practice in between games against Vegas last night and Seattle to come tomorrow.\n\u003eGame 1 versus Vegas could probably be summed up in one word, which Todd McLellan reinforced this morning – Second. \n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e We were second to everything. You could look at it from an analytics standpoint, use all the stats you want, but there’s a reason for those stats. When we needed to be first, we were second. We were slow, poor execution, second everywhere.\n\n\u003e I think that we had an idea of what we wanted to be last year, even the year before that probably. Sometimes you add really good players to your lineup and we’ve done that and you might want to try and be something you’re not. We’re 60 minutes into a season and the first two questions I’ve gotten are about identity and you guys are doing the exact same thing that I’m doing, you’re comparing it to last year and that’s my whole point, it starts all over again. What do you want to be, how can we win, what should we be. We’re figuring that out right now.\n\n\u003e The first thing that I did was I reminded our players that every year is a new year and you take on your own identity again. If you can go back to losing game seven in Edmonton, to that press conference, I said it would be hard, it starts all over again and you reinvent yourself year after year after year. The only comparable we have after three periods was last year, so now we take three periods of hockey this year and we compare it to what was there last year and we weren’t even close. As we go forward now, we’ll have to lay game two against game one because now we’re starting to get this year’s evidence. Maybe we’re going to be a loose, gambling, score five per night team and get it done that way, I don’t know, but that looked like how we wanted to play. If we feel as a group that’s where our identity has to go and we’re going to try it that way, great, but I’m not betting on it. We either reestablish who we are, or we try it a different way.\n\n### On [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n\u003e Personally, I think, and the coaching staff thinks, that he’s a step quicker. He looks a little faster, some of that’s confidence, some of its feeling good. He feels good about himself, about his game, his teammates are excited for him. There’s a lot of real positive things in his world right now and we’ve got to keep them there. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e For sure, yeah. It’s great to see. He’s definitely put his work in and he’s gotten a lot better and he’s definitely faster than he was the year before. It’s been great to see and I’m looking forward to playing with him. -- [[Alex Iafallo]]\n\n\u003e I do see that. I think there was a play in the preseason when it wasn’t an icing, but the other team’s defenseman had a lot of space on him and he caught him, stripped the puck and we got a chance off of it. Even on his backchecks, he’s getting back there quickly. He’s creating a lot off the forecheck, I think he’s definitely made a big improvement over the summer. -- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/Practice-10-14-Off-To-Minny-Getting-on-the-road-todays-alignment-Arvidsson-skates-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"Practice 10-14 - Off To Minny - Getting on the road, todays alignment, Arvidsson skates - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# Practice 10-14 - Off To Minny - Getting on the road, todays alignment, Arvidsson skates - LA Kings Insider\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-14 | [[LA Kings Insider]]  | [Practice 10-14 - Off To Minny - Getting on the road, todays alignment, Arvidsson skates - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/14/practice-10-14-off-to-minny-getting-on-the-road-todays-alignment-arvidsson-skates/)\n2022-10-14 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[Practice 10-14 - Off To Minny - Getting on the road, todays alignment, Arvidsson skates - LA Kings Insider]]\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n- [[Trevor Moore]]\n- [[Brendan Lemieux]]\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003eThe Kings hit the ice this morning for practice in El Segundo before heading off to the airport to begin the first roadtrip of the season. The games are coming hot and heavy on this trip, with the Kings set to play five games in eight nights, beginning tomorrow evening in Minnesota against the Wild. The Kings will also visit Detroit, Nashville, Pittsburgh and Washington on this trip, with four of those five teams in the postseason last year, and the fifth a team that added at the NHL level in the offseason.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e We’ve got 80 left and 41 of them are going to be on the road so it’s really early in the year, get out on the road while we’re fresh, bond a little bit. It sounds like a cliche, coaches use that all the time, but it’ll be good for us to get away. The one thing that we don’t get and that we do need is a lot of practice time on this trip, but that’s the way it goes.  -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e Yeah, I think so. When you’re on the road, it’s only hockey and it’s just the guys and hockey, which is good. You can go to dinner most nights on the road and like I said, it’s just the guys, so it’s a good time to get to know people and it’s just nice to spend time together. Especially after a couple losses, I think it can turn things around for us.  -- [[Trevor Moore]]\n\n\u003e Yeah, definitely. We spend enough time in LA, I spent the whole offseason here, so it’s good to get out and get on the road and be with the guys. I think just spending time together on the plane, on buses and whatnot, it’ll be good. Get out for some dinners, enjoy ourselves a little bit, just us as a group, away from the families and whatnot. It’ll be fun.  -- [[Brendan Lemieux]]\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/Practice-Notebook-10-5":{"title":"Practice Notebook 10-5","content":"\n# Practice Notebook 10-5\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-05   | [[LA Kings Insider]]  | [Practice Notebook 10-5](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/05/practice-notebook-10-5-three-groups-of-players-durzis-progression-alternate-jersey-schedule/)\n\n## Contributors:\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n## Players\n- [[Phillip Danault]]\n- [[Trevor Moore]]\n- [[Sean Durzi]]\n\n## Summary\n- Practice Notebook 10/5 – “Three Groups” of players, Durzi’s Progression, alternate jersey schedule\n\u003e Another day of practice here at Toyota Sports Performance Center as we approach Opening Night six days from today. The Kings are at the point in the process where they need to start making decisions on final roster moves. [[Todd McLellan]] described the group right now as players in one of three distinct categories, all with varying degrees of importance over the course of these next two games.\n\n## Notes\n\n\u003e They’re get ready and polish games. I think we have players right now that fall into three different buckets. We have guys that have had really good camps and are excelling, we probably don’t have to worry about them. We have players that have struggled lately and it’s clear they’re maybe not ready, we probably don’t have to worry about them. Then we have a group in the middle that is still finding their way.  -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e Take Phil Danault’s line, they’ve only played in two games, one was in Ontario, which was an awful night under different circumstances, so they’re still trying to find their game. We’ll make sure that in these next two games, we’re trying to get ready and feel good about ourselves individually and collectively, and then go from there, but the opportunity part of it is gone for a lot of players. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n### Sean Durzi shoulder surgery rehab\n\n\u003e We’re confident that he’s done the work. The people that needed to sign off on it have signed off on it. Now, it’s about getting him reps in game situations to make sure he feels comfortable and confident in his own game and the team game. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e I’m very confident. I mean, at the end of the day, I’ve got a good team around me that will make the best decision but personally, I’m confident and feeling better than ever and I’m excited. I’m enjoying it, but at the end of the day you want to play, it’s why you do it, it’s why you compete and that feeling of competition every day is what I’m looking forward to.

The goal that Vilardi scored, it was a dead play, but somehow [[Quinton Byfield]] got a stick on it, kept the play alive. Spending more time in the other team’s offensive zone, protecting pucks better. They work really hard to get it, and they’ll hold onto it and make good plays.

They just a played a totally different game. Structurally they weren’t pretty, but they got the job done. They know they’re roles. They knew what they wanted to do, hey frustrated us a little bit five-on-five, and they wanted to score on the powerplay, and that’s exactly what they did.\n\n\u003e He was pretty good. I thought him and Tynan had a really good game. With his shot, he’s so dangerous at five-on-five and five-on-four. Now, we have to find a way to get many more shots like that. He was good today, and he needs to be. Our best players have to be the best players every night, and today we didn’t have enough.\n\n\u003e We’re not going to win every game. There will be games when we’re going to be behind. Like today, we tied it up and then I thought we felt really good and the bench was alive. It was a little quiet before we had good momentum. Then, all of a sudden, we got the goal against. A bad bounce, maybe bad luck, but it doesn’t matter. That’s something we just have to get better at and we have to learn from it and use it for the next game.\n\n\u003e I thought he was really solid. There’s still maybe one or two goals he might want back, but you can tell he’s a veteran goalie. We’re really lucky and we’re very happy to have him in there because he will give us a chance every night to win the hockey game.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/REIGN-FINAL-Reign-8-Canucks-2-Sturm-Tynan-Grans-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"REIGN FINAL – Reign 8, Canucks 2 – Sturm, Tynan, Grans - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# REIGN FINAL – Reign 8, Canucks 2 – Sturm, Tynan, Grans - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date | Site | Link | \n| ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| 2022-10-14 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [REIGN FINAL – Reign 8, Canucks 2 – Sturm, Tynan, Grans - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/14/reign-final-reign-8-canucks-2-sturm-tynan-grans/)\n| 2022-10-14 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[REIGN FINAL – Reign 8, Canucks 2 – Sturm, Tynan, Grans - LA Kings Insider]]\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jared Shafran]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[T.J.

I think we didn’t \\[feel good] at the start. We were up 3-2 five minutes in but it was much too open. It’s the first game, I know everyone was excited and everyone wanted to get going, but after that we decided to gamble and started to play to our identity and came up with big goals. Overall, it was a big team effort today. Even after bad, ugly hits, guys stepped up. Even skilled guys like Lias \\[Andersson] and \\[Jacob Moverare]. It was good to see.\n\n\u003e It always helps when you get the guys back, especially the first unit. They know each other really well, so they know where to be and they support each other really well. They’re threats all over the place. It starts on the point with Spence, and then goes down to the flank. Kupari was a nice addition in the middle. There were lots of good things with the other units as well. Special teams will be very important down the stretch because there will be a lot of penalties to kill as well.\n\n\u003e I think he’s our best player, and on a lot of teams, the best players are captain. That’s why we named him captain, but we believe in him too. I think he also has to grow and learn how to be a captain as well. He’s up for the challenge. He’s working on it every day, and that’s what we like. He showed it today. The guys love him. He brings a lot to the team and the guys will stick up for him.\n\n\u003e He’s really good. He’s a good goalie but an even better person. His work ethic is one of the best I’ve seen from a goalie and I know the guys like him. He played big tonight. He stopped a few breakaways at the right time, and that’s what we need. I think every team wants a good goalie and I think we have one with him and Matthew Villalta. It was nice to see him with a big one tonight.\n\n\u003e I was surprised today too. Playing in the NHL, he probably wouldn’t try that move. It might work, yes, but if it doesn’t, then you’re probably in the doghouse. But here it was good for him. He tried it and ended up with a really nice highlight goal. When you play defense, everything is quick, so he doesn’t have that many touches in a game. It was nice to see him makes some plays and score that goal. Overall, I think he played really well. He was just a very good presence on the ice. All of those guys, especially the NHL guys, make a big difference.\n\n### [[T.J. Tynan]]\n\u003e Honestly, I don’t think we started very well. I think we found our game as it went on and obviously we have a lot of talent in that room. It was kind of a sloppy night but we’ll get better. We’ll take 8 goals, obviously, and the two points, so we’ll keep going from there.\n\n\u003e It was great. Obviously the most important thing is winning and that’s what we did. Brett Sutter was here for a long time. Those are big shoes that I’ll probably never fill. He was an amazing player, person, and teammate. He’s the best ever. For me, it’s just about being myself. I’ve got a lot of support in that room with the older guys and younger guys. We have a tight-knit group. It’s obviously an honor but the two points are what matters, and that’s what we got tonight.\n\n\u003e It’s been a treat. He’s been awesome. Every day, you’re going to work. He’s been there and he’s done it, so he knows. He’s somebody that you can pick his brain. He’s a good teacher and as players, that’s what you want. You want honest, you want to learn, and that’s what we’re going to do this year. We’re going to get better each day and that’s something everyone’s excited to see.\n\n\u003e You’re not going to find me complaining, right? He’s unbelievable. You can see it. I think everyone in the building can see it. I just think he’s incredible. Obviously, its nice. Last year, guys stepped up when he wasn’t here, but having him back tonight, he showed what an incredible talent he is.\n\n\u003e They make it easy, right? They’re amazing players and its good to see them get on the board early. For me, it’s just about using my skill set to try to get them pucks where they’re comfortable and where they like it. You get Lias the puck around the net and good things are going to happen. I actually missed Sammy a couple of times today, but if you can get him some pucks, he’s got a heck of a shot. We were okay tonight, obviously we scored a couple goals, but hopefully we get better and better each day.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/REIGN-PRESEASON-FINAL-Reign-2-Gulls-6-Sturm-Ward":{"title":"REIGN PRESEASON FINAL – Reign 2, Gulls 6 – Sturm, Ward","content":"\n# REIGN PRESEASON FINAL – Reign 2, Gulls 6 – Sturm, Ward\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n 2022-10-08   | [[LA Kings Insider]]  | [REIGN PRESEASON FINAL – Reign 2, Gulls 6 – Sturm, Ward](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/08/reign-preseason-final-reign-2-gulls-6-sturm-ward/)\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jared Shafran]]\n\n## Players\n- [[Taylor Ward]]\n\n## Summary\n\u003e In their only game of the 2022 preseason, one that was filled with special teams, the Ontario Reign fell short to the San Diego Gulls by a final score of 6-2 Saturday night at Pechanga Arena. Rookie forwards Martin Chromiak and Taylor Ward scored the tallies for Ontario, while goaltender Matt Villalta started the game and made 18 saves on 19 shots in just over 31 minutes of action.\n\n## Notes\n### [[Marco Sturm]]\n\u003e Going into a game like this, some guys have never even played a game yet. You want to try to get your legs going. You try to do the stuff we worked on all week and try to be the best player you can be. I think there’s a lot of guys who showed me and the coaching staff what they can do what they can bring for the team.\n\n\u003e Well, we got scored on twice on our power play and we got two or three goals against on the penalty kill, so that has to be fixed, but lots of different guys in lots of different positions today. I think there’s some areas today we have to work on. I think there’s some guys in this locker room, who will be here, who have to be better too. The season starts in a week. There’s a short turnaround and I think the guys have been going hard all week long. They deserve to have a day off tomorrow and then regroup and try to be better on Monday.\n\n\u003e There’s a few things that I think are in our control and I think the mistakes we made, especially the first 45 minutes, everything was on our tape. We’ve got to keep things simple first. I think everyone has to know their role on the team. You don’t have to do anything special. We’ve just got to play hard, play for the team, be a good teammate, and win some hockey games.\n\n\u003e I know we have a lot of toughness on our team, but I’m not looking at that. I want to play hockey. Yes, this is a big part of our team and our game, but at the end of the day, I just didn’t like the way we played. I think we had a good start and first 10 minutes, but in the end San Diego was just better than us. I think we still had enough good players in our lineup, but again, it was a good lesson for all of us. I’ll just have to make sure it’s not going to happen again.\n\n### [[Taylor Ward]]\n\u003e ","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/REIGN-PREVIEW-Ontario-vs-Abbotsford-10-14-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"REIGN PREVIEW – Ontario vs Abbotsford, 10-14 - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# REIGN PREVIEW – Ontario vs Abbotsford, 10-14 - LA Kings Insider\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-14 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [REIGN PREVIEW – Ontario vs Abbotsford, 10-14 - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/14/reign-preview-ontario-vs-abbotsford-10-14/)\n2022-10-14 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[REIGN PREVIEW – Ontario vs Abbotsford, 10-14 - LA Kings Insider]]\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jared Shafran]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[T.J.

Unfortunately, last year, having been diagnosed with mono right before training camp, we really didn’t get to see him. Then, we brought him out \\[to LA] after the Barrie Colts were eliminated in the playoffs, but he had a knee injury that required surgery; that kept him out. So, we never really had a hands-on view of him, by any means. \\[There were] lots of expectations when he came into camp and lived up to it. He’s fit in. I think one of the big things going forward was the way he played – very creative, very deceptive. But what we wanted to make sure – ‘Is he going to compete hard enough? Was he going to be coachable? Was he going to listen to what Trent Yawney and Todd McLellan were preaching? Would he buy into the system?’ And that’s been way above, I think, any expectations any of us had on him. So, he’s earned his chance.\n\n\u003e It’s still a situation that’s going to evolve here. We have to make sure that when he’s in the lineup that he’s getting the reasonable amount of minutes to keep developing. If you look, a lot of it will probably rely on Trent Yawney and just his previous experiences with young D in the other organizations he’s been in, and how he’s been able to take them and get them minutes. He talks about it all the time, ‘Listen, he’s as good as some of the players in the NHL at making plays, he’s deceptive, he can show that he can be there. We just have to make sure we’re continually getting him the minutes that will help him develop. It’s an ongoing situation. The first step was getting through training camp and he’s going to get his reps here during the regular season now.\n\n\u003e I don’t know if we have anything in concrete right now. There are a couple things that go \\[into it]. We have to get Sean Walker and Sean Durzi up to speed with their injury. … Those injuries were long-term, and especially Walker’s situation. So, he’s going to have to get his reps and everything in there. Getting Brandt into the lineup will be the first step, then managing his minutes and seeing how the games go, and the pace of the regular season. There is a big difference between training camp, preseason games, and the regular season. We’ll have to monitor it. I don’t think we have a plan set in place. We’re fortunate, \\[not only] with [[Trent Yawney]], but also with \\[new assistant coach] [[Jim Hiller]]. He went through this with the Islanders, with a young defenseman in Noah Dobson. I think it was his 19-year-old year in the NHL; just with how they used him early on until he got into the lineup.

As a free agent coming out of college after spending four seasons at the University of Nebraska-Omaha, Ward chose to begin his pro career with the Kings, agreeing to a one-year entry level deal on March 19.\n\n## Notes\n\u003e I was on the phone a lot; I was doing a bunch of research and getting as much information as I could on what I wanted to do next and I had the opportunity to speak with pretty much everybody in this organization. I just loved what I heard from everyone and their emphasis on development so it just felt like the right fit and it’s a tough place to say no to so I didn’t. -- [[Taylor Ward]]\n\n\u003e I was thrown in there at the end of last season and into the playoffs, which actually helped me become pretty comfortable with the guys pretty quickly last year. -- [[Taylor Ward]]\n\n\u003e To be able to spend the summer here with a handful of Kings guys that I got to really watch and learn from, it was really cool. And now to be able to see those guys at the rink every day and feel comfortable, I’m enjoying it. I feel like it’s made my first few days here at rookie camp a lot easier, rather than just coming in without knowing anybody so I’m glad I did it and it was a great experience. -- [[Taylor Ward]]\n\n\u003e I felt pretty good there in the first game. It was the first game of my season and moving up there playing with Q and Madds, I thought we played well and we were creating offense. Obviously that’s more fun than playing in the D zone so that’s what we like to do. The coaches expressed that they were happy with how I was playing so that’s always good to hear as well. -- [[Taylor Ward]]\n\n\u003e “I didn’t really know him, but I’m very pleased. The way he plays, he reminds me of a few players I played with, so I think there’s something to it and he’s been really good, he’s a pleasant surprise. We’re going to try to keep pushing him to get more out of him, but so far, he’s had a really good tournament. -- [[Marco Sturm]] on [[Taylor Ward]]\n\n\u003e He just brings such a presence and he’s a very smart man. Anytime he opens his mouth, I’m trying to learn as much as possible, listen, and then apply what he’s saying to my game. The first few days have been great so far and I think everybody in the room is a big fan of his so I’m excited to keep playing for him. -- [[Taylor Ward]] on [[Marco Sturm]]\n\n\u003e It’s been really fun so far. I’ve never been at a rookie camp or anything like it before so I’m having fun with it. It’s cool to see some of your buddies on the other teams and obviously getting out there and putting on a Kings uniform is something special no matter where or when you’re doing it. -- [[Taylor Ward]]\n\n\u003e I didn’t want to come into my first main camp with no idea of what to expect and not knowing many people. So now to be able to come into camp and feel much more comfortable with the guys that are in the locker room and the coaching staff, training staff and everybody around, it’s definitely a big help for sure. I think I’d be much more nervous if I was back home the whole summer. -- [[Taylor Ward]]\n\n\u003e We’ve got some really smart guys up there in the gym in LA and the things we did were actually pretty interesting and very helpful.

Contributors\n- \n\n\n## Players\n- \n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Todd McLellan talks to the media ahead of a preseason matchup vs the Anaheim Ducks\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e is there a number that you'd like to see\nthe full group play together or is it\nmore about the music people well as we\nget we've got four left and play every\nsecond night\num we're still trying to evaluate some\nof the question marks they need to\ncontinue to play but we have to make\nsure now that the team is up and running\nand by the end of the training camp the\nveterans should all have three to four\ngames for sure\num\nmaybe not quite today but moving forward\nyou'd like to see all your units\ntogether at one point\nuh pairs using uh they're playing with\neach other on the penalty kill I think\nthat's important but we still got a game\nor two here to evaluate and try and give\nopportunity to some and um\nevery player has a lifeline and\nsome players have extended there's\nothers it's shrunk on them but this is\nthe week\ndoes venue play a role in the preseason\nor as a first game first preseason game\nof crypto because that did teach you\nanything uh it doesn't necessarily help\nteach I don't think but\nuh a common theme around the league as\nyou dress a few more veterans\num at home you don't have to travel\nalone\nto wherever you're going\num and they play big big minutes during\nthe year\nalleviate travel I think you're seeing\nthat so tenancy is that the home team\nat points has a stronger lineup or more\nveteran type lineup because that's where\nyou want to play those individuals and\nRogue team tends to be a little younger\nor\nguys that haven't played quite as much\nor won't play as much during the year so\nI I think that's a tendency around the\nleague\num that's what we're seeing again this\nyear\nit's not the big night for Sean Walker\nyou can actually kind of get back into\nit here with whatever maybe not\nnecessarily Sean but speaking from a\ngeneral standpoint\nis there a trade a trait about\nyou you said you refer to him as someone\nthat kind of has had a pitbull\nfor players like him those are a move\nundrafted those have maybe been whole\nis there something about them in\nparticular that\nI don't know really drives them\nwhatsoever that that's okay yeah this is\na good question and a good observation\nso um obviously walks and and we talked\nabout\nI think about a week ago 10 days ago\nabout the undrafted players that have\nbeen able to come through here playing\nand these are the ones that have stuck\nwith it and committed and bullied their\nway into teams lineups\num there's a whole bunch that haven't\ndone that but the ones that have\num have that\nconstitutiveness that determination\nI'm going to prove you wrong every night\nand if you tell me I can't I'll show you\nI can\nmentality and when you look at the mazat\nWalker\nifollo those types of players they play\nthat way I think most nights they're\npersonal makeup reflects their fight to\nget into the league and stay in the\nleague and they they play that way and\nthat's probably why I use the word\npitbull with with Locker there's a scent\nmaybe a little not to compare but do you\nsee where there's a little bit of more\nof a sense where it's like you can't\ntake things for granted the the\nentitlements used in our society\neverywhere not not in just in the LA\nKings locker room or in the NHL it's all\nit's all over the place\num\nand those individuals are not entitled\nthey don't feel like they've been given\nanything they've had to fight and\ncontinue to prove\nsometimes at the other end of the scale\npeople will look and say well they've\nbeen given everything and they've been\nentitled in nine lives type scenario for\ndifferent individuals under different\ncircumstances but the whole group that\nwe're talking about zero entitlement\nso if you look at a guy over on his\noffside from a coaching standpoint where\nwhere do you like what concerns do you\nhave well for a guy like what he can or\ncannot do a planning options\nit's I think it's individual\num comfort\nwhen you do that some cans some can't\nand for a whole bunch of different\nreasons based on the individual the the\npivot the ability to see things uh\ngetting around the puck to shoot it\num confidence to play over there and\nthere is there isn't a single variable\nthat that they all fall into it's\ndifferent for everyone\num\nAlex said there's played in the league\nfor\nhowever long he's played I don't know 15\n16 years\nhe feels good over there he just goes\nand stands over that's what he does so\nhis ability to change now would be\nharder than something that hasn't done\nit there's another variable\nso your your questions a good one but I\ncan't answer it\nspecifically because I think every demon\ntakes on different\nthese different variables that come into\nplay there\nyou mentioned\nyou hold the equipment I'm obviously you\ngot sick right now but what do you need\nto see from him to make that a reality\nwhat does he need to earn that extra ice\ntime\nwell he's got a Beat\num some other centermen we're going to\nplay in the center he's going to be take\nice time away from those other\nindividuals it's a tough task on our\nteam when you look at copy and you look\nat what Phil does and how hard lizzo\nplays and the the effect he had so uh\nanyway you cut it there's 60 Minutes a\nnight certain games roll out with power\nplays and penalty kills but at the end\nof the day you've got to start grabbing\nminutes from other people\nso his minutes could go up and down\nbased on others performances but he's\nalso responsible for his own and we\nexpect\nthere's that word expectations our\ninternal expectations are realistic\nthey're\num\nattainable\ntheir\nteam orientated but also individual\ndriven and our expectations for cues\nhave taken the next step physically on\nthe ice stain the models a little bit\nmore I haven't seen the blocked off\npucks very much this year which is\nalready a good sign\nthe ability to make plays a little bit\nquicker more production offensively he's\ngot great instincts and stuff can you\nget more out of that is he responsible\ndefensively does this\nFace-Off numbers go way up and we've\nseen that already in the exhibition\nseason so\nhe's already taking steps to more ice\ntime\nbut the way the game rolls out and what\nthe others are doing also affects how\nyou use people what's the likelihood of\nuh being able to get Jersey and\nsometimes later uh we're hoping to do\nthat and potentially already depending\non how\nyou know RV would likely be that last\ngame if he's going to play it all durers\nwe really believe we can get him in a\ngame or two even this week\nwith Thursday and a lot coming back\nbecause I make it more difficult to get\nsome of your Brent carp has had a good\namount of campaign in the lineup and how\ndo you kind of deal with that situation\ndifficult decisions are good ones for us\nand yeah getting Jersey back and watch\nback is is great for our team the fact\nthat the the kid is really pushing and\ndoing some good things is another bonus\nfor all of us\num it'll be they'll sort themselves out\nas time goes on\num\neverybody's at a different\njuncture in their careers uh Alexander\nis not going to play in Ontario who's\ngoing to play on our team uh Brian Clark\nhas two options he can play here go back\nto Junior there's some that are waiver\nbowl that buy us time there's other guys\nwe have to think about for waivers\nthere's so many factors that come in and\nwhat we look like on day one on the blue\nline\nmight not be what we look like on day\ntwo it can vary from day to day and not\neven based on injury just performance\nand\nbusiness\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/Top-10-Questions-at-Training-Camp-Rookie-Face-Off-Recap":{"title":"Top 10 Questions at Training Camp

He was on-track and doing well in the summer, but then had a setback \\[and wasn’t able to participate at Development Camp]. So we’re dealing with that. He’s currently in a stage of his rehab where he’s skating on his own. Progressing from that point, we have some medical appointments next week for him. If everything goes as planned, and the way it’s directed, he’ll soon start working his way back into a non-contact spot at practice. Then, we’ll go from there. It’s a difficult situation for him and for us, but we have to put his health first. I know we all want to \\[see him back playing], but he has to be healthy with himself and be in that situation before he can get back on the ice. -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/Viktor-Arvidsson":{"title":"Viktor Arvidsson","content":"\n# Viktor Arvidsson\n\nNHL.com | Twitter\n-|-\n[Viktor Arvidsson]() | [@twitter_handle](https://twitter.com/)\n\nPlayer | \\# | Position | Shoots | Height | Weight | Born | Birthplace | Draft \n-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-\nViktor Arvidsson | 33 | LW | R | 5' 10\" | 185 | 1993-04-08 | Skellefteå, SWE | 2014 NSH, 4th rd, 22nd pk (112th overall)\n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date       | Site                    | Title                                                                                                          |\n| ---------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-17 | [[Kings at NHL.com]]    | [[Danaults second goal gives Kings OT win against Red Wings]]                                                  |\n| 2022-10-17 | [[The Forum Report]]    | [[No firm Edler, Iafallo updates -

Like Nashville, or L.A., St. Paul wasn’t the best place to go when trying to figure your game out, and while the National Hockey League provides such incredible theatre every night, defensively sharp Kings-Wild games often made you squint to find it. But it is not 2013 anymore, and the series’ sluggardly yesteryear was finally and mercifully laid to rest by a 13-goal, 1980’s-style game where Los Angeles won all the momentum swings and received tantalizing performances from several players whose importance to the organization is much broader than their stat line on a Saturday in October.\n\n\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003eI don’t know that \\[the offense] will increase, but I do believe \\[last year’s surge] will remain the same because the amount of talent coming into the league is immense. Teams are built differently now than they were even five, six, seven years ago. -- [[Todd McLellan]] \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/Walker-in-after-Edler-takes-puck-to-face-in-warm-ups":{"title":"Walker in after Edler takes puck to face in warm-ups","content":"\n# Walker in after Edler takes puck to face in warm-ups\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-17 | [[The Forum Report]] | [Walker in after Edler takes puck to face in warm-ups](https://theforumreport.com/walker-in-after-edler-takes-puck-to-face-in-warm-ups-in-detroit/) |\n| 2022-10-17 | [[The Forum Report]] | [[Walker in after Edler takes puck to face in warm-ups]]                                                                                            |\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jon Rosen]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e It’s hard to imagine the type of blunt force injury that could remove a resilient figure like Alex Edler from a game, but yeesh.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Alex Edler]]\n- [[Sean Walker]]\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/Week-1-Pacific-Division-Power-Rankings":{"title":"Week 1 Pacific Division Power Rankings","content":"\n# Week 1 Pacific Division Power Rankings\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-11 | [[Hockey Royalty]] | [Week 1 Pacific Division Power Rankings](https://hockeyroyalty.com/2022/10/11/week-1-pacific-division-power-rankings/#:~:text=3.%20Los%20Angeles%20Kings)\n2022-10-11 | [[Hockey Royalty]] | [[Week 1 Pacific Division Power Rankings]]\n## Contributors\n- [[Jack Weber]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Drew Doughty]]\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Jonathan Quick]]\n- [[Cal Petersen]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Here’s how the Pacific Division stacks up as the puck gets set to drop on the 2022-23 season.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/What-to-watch-in-Rangers-Lightning-Kings-Knights-on-ESPN":{"title":"What to watch in Rangers-Lightning, Kings-Knights on ESPN","content":"\n# What to watch in Rangers-Lightning, Kings-Knights on ESPN\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-11 | [[ESPN]]  | [What to watch in Rangers-Lightning, Kings-Knights on ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/34769001/what-watch-rangers-lightning-kings-knights-espn#:~:text=Vegas%20Golden%20Knights%20at%20Los%20Angeles%20Kings)\n2022-10-11 | [[ESPN]] | [[What to watch in Rangers-Lightning, Kings-Knights on ESPN]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Kristen Shilton]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Mikey Anderson]]\n- [[Sean Durzi]]\n- [[Jonathan Quick]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e If opposites attract, then the Golden Knights and Kings would be a perfect match.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/With-a-blank-slate-Kings-focused-on-replicating-second-half-success-on-the-penalty-kill":{"title":"With a blank slate, Kings focused on replicating second-half success on the penalty kill","content":"\n# With a blank slate, Kings focused on replicating second-half success on the penalty kill\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-01 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [With a blank slate, Kings focused on replicating second-half success on the penalty kill](http://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/01/with-a-blank-slate-kings-focused-on-replicating-second-half-success-on-the-penalty-kill/)\n2022-10-01 | [[LA Kings Insider]] |  [[With a blank slate, Kings focused on replicating second-half success on the penalty kill]]\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Mikey Anderson]]\n- [[Trevor Moore]]\n- [[Blake Lizotte]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Trent Yawney]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Through six games last season, the LA Kings sat 31st in the NHL in penalty kill percentage, having conceded seven goals from their first six games of the season. A 7-3 October loss in St. Louis saw the Blues tally four power-play goals in one game and after a four-game road trip, the Kings sat barely over 50 percent on the penalty kill, which set a difficult hurdle to come back from.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e I know everybody looks at the standings and they go well, they’re 31st and what’s kind of interesting for me last year is that we got off to a terrible start and when you get tapped for four in one game, it’s hard to recover. No one wrote that they jumped from 31st to 22nd at the end of the year and that is pretty impressive, it’s a credit to them. It doesn’t happen all the time. -- [[Trent Yawney]]\n\n\u003e We’ve looked at in segments, you take a 20-game segment and look at how you’re doing as a unit. Obviously, that one game kind of wrecked everything we had, but if you block it off into different chunks, we had a good penalty kill at times throughout the rest of the year. As much as it’s a full number, there’s ups and downs, peaks and valleys. It’s trying to analyze how you’re doing in your 10, 20 game segments and kind of go from there. -- [[Mikey Anderson]]\n\n\u003e Honestly, shorthanded goals are like a cherry on top, that’s not really the standard. Yanwns has been preaching for the last couple of years that we want to be aggressive and we want to go chase down pucks and make it hard on their team. Shorthanded goals are a product of that, so I think that his structure gives you opportunities but keeping the puck out of the net is the most important. -- [[Trevor Moore]]\n\n\u003e If you take last year, I \\[remember] all of them, but they were turning points in some of those games. We did get bit a couple times thinking that we had a scoring opportunity that ended up in the back of our net, so you don’t want to coach the offense out of them on the PK but remind them that killing the penalty is the priority and anything after that is a bonus. Staying aggressive, that’s kind of our word, to just stay aggressive when the opportunity does provide itself whether it’s on the killing side, the defensive side or we get the offensive opportunity to take advantage of it. -- [[Trent Yawney]]\n\n\u003e Pretty much everyone’s back, so we have an idea of what we want to do. It’s kind of just going over it in the room again, talking about it and watching video, but until you go through it and kill some penalties, you’re just trying to get back into it and then find the right ways to do it. I think communication and trying to kind of readdress everything we’ve talked about the past couple years is key. -- [[Mikey Anderson]]\n\n\u003e We’re hoping to find some new players, guys that maybe you don’t think are going to be penalty killers. You put them in situations and they take advantage of an opportunity and when you’re not dressing your full lineup, you have that that option. Todd has tried to work some different guys through, who were here last year but haven’t really been put \\[on the PK] in a game situation. These exhibition games provide that and it’s good to see how they react in a practice versus a game because it is different. -- [[Trent Yawney]]\n\n\u003e We kind of dug ourselves a hole last year and it took us close to the whole season to try and come out of it. Our numbers weren’t really where we wanted them to be, so I think a goal of ours is to start off really well on the penalty kill. I take a lot of pride in that and I think boosting our numbers by at least a couple of percentage points is a good goal. -- [[Blake Lizotte]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/With-a-fresh-slate-the-work-is-well-underway-when-it-comes-to-the-LA-Kings-power-play":{"title":"With a fresh slate, the work is well underway when it comes to the LA Kings power play","content":"\n# With a fresh slate, the work is well underway when it comes to the LA Kings power play\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-03 | [[LA Kings Insider]] |  [With a fresh slate, the work is well underway when it comes to the LA Kings power play](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/03/with-a-fresh-slate-the-work-is-well-underway-when-it-comes-to-the-la-kings-power-play/)\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n## Players\n- \n\n## Summary\n\u003e It’s the topic you’ve likely asked the most about this season. It’s one of the bigger storylines and questions entering the 2022-23 season. It’s the LA Kings power play.\n\n## Notes\n\u003e I’ll finish probably every comment on the power play by saying it’s in the works right now. It’s quite early in the season and a lot of teams penalty kills haven’t had the time to polish up at this point. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e People try to imitate what’s working and there are certain things that are working right now, certain looks that teams are trying to get to that work for them. Will it work for the LA Kings, we’re not sure yet, but we did study those things pretty early. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e Jimmy brought a fresh set of eyes to our video from last year. It wasn’t tainted with opinion or frustration or joy, whatever it might be on that on the happy side. It was just a new set of eyes and he shared a lot of thoughts and ideas with us, so we adopted some of those things. He’s been around some good players and good power plays. -- [[Todd McLellan]] on [[Jim Hiller]]\n\n\u003e People in new places, with new roles that may take some predictability away from what could or should happen. The types of pieces we’re still using are quite common, or the individual pieces are quite common, and they might be in different spots, that may play a different role within it, but it’s still quite early. A lot of its experimental, we hope to make it permanent, but we’ll see how it goes. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e We’ve talked a lot about players with different hands, left shots, right shots, where different people could be options. Throughout training camp, we’ve just been trying that out. If you look at Kopi, Juice and Kevin, they’re playing as a line, but all three are lefties, so they’re almost interchangeable in the spots they’re playing in on the power play. -- [[Jim Hiller]]\n\n\u003e Especially off of breakout, it’s not going to be perfect, you’re not always going to be able to just sprint to your position, you have to be able to play in the middle and on the flank. Especially between me and Kevin, I think we’re both pretty similar in those areas, on the bumper and on the flank, it’s going to be whoever else ends up there. -- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n\n\u003e You know, I think all of us, not just us two but all of us can interchange and I think that’s what good power plays do. You don’t have a spot, you see how it goes and fill in wherever you are and play from there. -- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n\u003e With the breakouts and stuff where you come in, if I’m not \\[in position], it takes 5-10 seconds for me to sprint to the other side and for others to get set up. It helps a lot I think, it’s a good thing to not have to be in specific spots all of the time. -- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n\n\u003e Everybody wants to be good on the power play, it’s important, especially end of the year and in the playoffs, because it can win you games. Special teams, both PK and power play are huge. -- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n\u003e There’s really no secret sauce to it, it’s just being able to execute, feel confident and feel good about it. Sometimes it’s just getting on a roll, you start to feel good. -- [[Jim Hiller]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/With-a-spot-on-the-opening-night-roster-Brandt-Clarke-is-ready-to-seize-his-surreal-opportunity-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"With a spot on the opening night roster, Brandt Clarke is ready to seize his surreal opportunity - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# With a spot on the opening night roster, Brandt Clarke is ready to seize his surreal opportunity - LA Kings Insider\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-10 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [With a spot on the opening night roster, Brandt Clarke is ready to seize his surreal opportunity - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/10/with-a-spot-on-the-opening-night-roster-brandt-clarke-is-ready-to-seize-his-surreal-opportunity/)\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e As the LA Kings hit the ice for practice this morning, donning their chrome helmets in advance of tomorrow’s season opener, one, slightly legible number stood out amongst the rest.\n\u003e 92.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e I went with 92, 55 is my original number but obviously Q has that. My brother wears 92, so it’s cool that if we can both make the NHL, we’ll wear it together, and my birthday is also February 9, ninth day of the second month, so that works out well too. I also think it looks pretty sharp. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e It’s surreal, it’s something I’ve been working for my entire life really, it’s been a goal of mine. I’ve really ramped it up since knowing this was real possibility. They’ve given a real opportunity to showcase myself and I think I took advantage of that, I’m just stoked to be here. This is a dream of mine. I love the players here, I love the staff here and I’m thrilled to be on this team. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\n\u003e Brandt knows who Brandt is, he knows what’s in his toolbox, in his toolkit. He hasn’t played with fear and what I mean by fear is not the physical part of it, it’s the fear of erring on the ice, he makes plays, the intense plays. He’s been very coachable throughout training camp. Potentially away from the Kings, I could see where that confidence or that swagger could be misread in other environments, where it could hurt him, but with us, not one bit. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e It comes down to making sure that when he does get the lineup, he’s going to get the right amount of minutes to keep developing. His play through rookie camp and training camp has put him to a level where we want to see him in the NHL and that kind of went into the decision process. Now, the step is to make sure that it keeps going that way and we’ll let that play out here for the first little while and probably have to reevaluate \\[later on]. -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\u003e I think he can play in all situations, including penalty kill, which can give you an opportunity to get the minutes needed to keep developing at the NHL level. Power play, obviously, you see the deception and his hockey IQ, but also defending, he’s good in a sense with his defending. He’ll have to learn to protect himself a little bit more, there are guys who are bigger and stronger at this level than in juniors. I think his all-around game, there are a lot of aspects that would allow a player when he does get in the lineup in the regular season to maintain those minutes that are going to help him progress. -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\u003e We’ve tried quite a few \\[players] over there, [[Sean Walker]]’s played there at times, I think we’ve got to get him comfortable coming back from the surgery before we experiment again with the left side. We saw [[Sean Durzi]] slide over there and make that transition really easy and we’ve used Clarke over there a couple of times. The availability to open up that left side within our defense can increase \\[the chances of] getting Brandt in the lineup and getting him the minutes he needs. -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\u003e You see the professional attitude around here, it’s really telling and if you want to stick here, you have to bring the same attitude every day in practices, games, workouts. It’s really been an eye opener how seriously everyone takes it, how determined everyone is here. I’ve tried to match that, I’ve had to bring my ‘A’ performance every single day because if not I’m going to fall behind and I wouldn’t be on this team right now. That’s something I’m pretty proud of with the consistency that I brought and I’m going to try to continue it. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\n\u003e We’ll see what happens. Whether I’m in the press box or in the lineup, either way it’ll be pretty soon. I’m just really appreciative to be here and thrilled to be on this team.  -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.668147745Z","tags":null},"/With-offseason-shoulder-surgery-behind-him-Sean-Durzi-is-right-on-track-in-his-return-to-action":{"title":"With offseason shoulder surgery behind him, Sean Durzi is right on track in his return to action","content":"\n# With offseason shoulder surgery behind him, Sean Durzi is right on track in his return to action\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-01 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [With offseason shoulder surgery behind him, Sean Durzi is right on track in his return to action](http://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/01/with-offseason-shoulder-surgery-behind-him-sean-durzi-is-right-on-track-in-his-return-to-action/)\n2022-10-01 | [[LA Kings Insider]] |  [[With offseason shoulder surgery behind him, Sean Durzi is right on track in his return to action]]\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Sean Durzi]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e For the first time yesterday, the LA Kings were whole once again.\n\u003e As Viktor Arvidsson rejoined the main group at Toyota Sports Performance Center, the Kings finally had all expected members of the season-opening roster on the ice at once. Arvidsson was the last piece of the puzzle, joining the most recent add before him in defenseman Sean Durzi.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Sean Durzi]]\n\u003e When I made the decision to kind of get it done and have to get it fixed, I knew the biggest thing I wanted to work on was kind of my speed and explosiveness. Talking to the people around me – the coaching staff, the trainers here – when it’s an upper body injury, you obviously have to take some time off but when I got back to it, I was able to do a lot of the explosive work. Maybe not kind of jack up my shoulders, but we have so many machines and there’s so much technology that I was able to kind of work on those kind of things.\n\n\u003e There was one back in juniors, kind of a nagging thing and I really didn’t know I needed surgery until like three weeks before the season, so I ended up missing a couple of weeks. Similar idea where I had to monitor my training with it, that one was probably a little bit worse because I didn’t know what it was at first, it was nagging. This one I got ahead of it right after the season, got it done and in the summer I had a good plan, a good team in place and just had to execute it.\n\n\u003e I’ve separated shoulders, but this is the first time I’ve come back from shoulder surgery, which is a little bit different,. Any upper-body injury, where you know you’re going feel it in contact, there’s always that hesitation but practicing at one-hundred percent and practicing with full contact with these guys up there, it gives me a little more confidence every single day. So \\[yesterday] was a really good day with contact in battle drills and things like that.\n\n\u003e Not quite, I don’t think I’m ready. It’s nice to be out of the red jersey and to kind of get into some contact today but it’s a process, taking bodies and things like that, but I’m progressing well and it shouldn’t keep me out long.\n\n\u003e It’s tough to know, but all I can say right now is I’m progressing well. The biggest thing is taking it day by day, I’ve been so patient with it, I’ve done a good job this summer and the people around me have done such a good job that I want to make sure I’m getting ready to go.\n\n\u003e Already, it feels better than it did last season, so that’s awesome. I’ve noticed it a lot in my shot, the way I can handle the puck, my movements out there. When I first got the surgery, then you progress and progress and then I got to that point where I was last season] and now it’s like I’m surpassing it and it’s really cool to see that. It makes it all worth it, makes patience worth it and to go out there hopefully feeling better than it was, it’s exciting.","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.672147777Z","tags":null},"/Younger-Kings-players-must-beat-Anze-Kopitar-for-scoring-title-Los-Angeles-Times":{"title":"Younger Kings players must beat Anze Kopitar for scoring title - Los Angeles Times","content":"\n# Younger Kings players must beat Anze Kopitar for scoring title - Los Angeles Times\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n 2022-10-03 | [[LA Times]] | [Younger Kings players must beat Anze Kopitar for scoring title - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-10-03/kings-stanley-cup-contenders-anze-kopitar-phillip-danault-drew-doughty)\n2022-10-03 | [[LA Times]] | [[Younger Kings players must beat Anze Kopitar for scoring title - Los Angeles Times]]\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Helene Elliott]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n- [[Drew Doughty]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e It says a lot about Anze Kopitar — and the Kings — that he has led them in scoring 14 of the last 15 seasons. \\[...] But as the Kings rise again, they’d be better off if Kopitar doesn’t lead them in scoring this season. At minimum they need him to be seriously challenged for supremacy because that will mean they’ve gathered enough skill and scoring depth to contend for the Cup again.\n\n\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e It’s going to be hard to beat Kopi in scoring, ever. He’s our No. 1 guy for all that type of stuff. Guys like Fiala or Kempe or Danault maybe have an opportunity to outscore him, but to be honest, I don’t really see it happening. I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s 15 of 16. -- [[Drew Doughty]]\n\n\u003e Kopi is still a high-end player that’s capable of playing high-end minutes on our team or any other team in the league. You could drop him on the Stanley Cup champs and they’re going to play him those minutes because he’s a quality player. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e I feel good, I feel like I’m in good shape and still young enough to log all the minutes. Whoever wins the scoring title, it’s good for me or whoever it’s going to be. But it’s a matter of a team game. That’s what we’ve done in years past and that’s what we have to do. It’s a matter of making sure the team plays the way we need to play to make the playoffs, and then go deep and ultimately go all the way again. -- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\n\u003e The feeling’s good, obviously. I think it was a big step last year, especially with all the injuries that went through this locker room throughout the season, and a much-needed gaining of experience. Because playing in a Game 7 it’s a different type of deal, versus being a 4-1 series \\[loss] or 4-0.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.672147777Z","tags":null},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz?

Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true` and `operandApiKey` to your copied key.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: true\noperandApiKey: \"0e733a7f-9b9c-48c6-9691-b54fa1c8b910\"\n```\n7. Make a commit and push your changes to GitHub. See the [[notes/hosting|hosting]] page if you haven't done this already.\n\t1. This step is *required* for Operand to be able to properly index your content. \n\t2. Head over to Dashboard \u003e Objects and select the collection that you made earlier\n8. Press `(Cmd + K)` to open the omnibar again and select 'Create GitHub Repo'\n\t1. Set the 'Repository Label' to `Quartz`\n\t2. Set the 'Repository Owner' to your GitHub username\n\t3. Set the 'Repository Ref' to `master`\n\t4. Set the 'Repository Name' to the name of your repository (usually just `quartz` if you forked the repository without changing the name)\n\t5. Leave 'Root Path' and 'Root URL' empty\n9. Wait for your repository to index and enjoy natural language search in Quartz! Operand refreshes the index every 2h so all you need to do is just push to GitHub to update the contents in the search.","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.672147777Z","tags":null},"/notes/setup":{"title":"Setup","content":"\n## Making your own Quartz\nSetting up Quartz requires a basic understanding of `git`.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n🐛 [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.672147777Z","tags":null},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?

However, there’s a lot more talent in the USA Hockey pipeline, and one of those names is Alex Turcotte. The 18 year old Wisconsin Badger-commit was a force this season on an already stacked team, and has all the tools to be a top line player at the NHL level.\n\n**2019** [**NHL Draft**](http://www.sbnation.com/nhl-draft) **Profile: Alex Turcotte**\n\nPosition/team: C/USNTDP Juniors, USHL (University of Wisconsin commit)  \n2018-19 Statistics: 12 G, 22 A in 16 GP  \nSize: 5’11” 185\n\n**Pre-draft rankings**\n\nNo. 4 (NA Skaters) by [NHL Central Scouting](http://www.nhl.com/ice/draftprospectbrowse.htm)  \nNo. 5 by [Future Considerations](https://futureconsiderations.ca/top-rankings-2019/)  \nNo. 4 by [ISS Hockey](https://www.isshockey.com/iss-hockey-releases-iss-top-31-for-june-rankings-of-the-top-prospects-for-the-2019-nhl-draft/)  \nNo. 3 by [Pronman/The Athletic](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516590\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://theathletic.com/970746/2019/05/21/pronmans-2019-nhl-draft-board-top-107-prospects/\u0026referrer=sbnation.com\u0026sref=https://www.broadstreethockey.com/2019/6/12/18661726/alex-turcotte-draft-profile-stats-analysis-analytics-highlights-2019-nhl-draft\u0026xcust=___sb__p_18425767__t_w__d_D)\n\n## What’s there to like?\n\nA whole lot, as a matter of fact. Turcotte possesses one of the more explosive games in this year’s draft class outside the obvious in Jack Hughes and Kaapo Kakko. Something that I noticed a lot in him is the different ways he can beat defensemen and the goalie. His speed isn’t dominant like his USA teammate in Hughes, but when he gets going he’s tough to stop. Not only does he possess a good top speed, but he’s elusive and can break the puck out efficiently with his skating talent alone. Combine this with his stellar ice vision, passing ability, and dangles you have a multi-dimensional center breakout option that is extremely difficult to defend against.\n\nAnd there in lies potentially Turcotte’s greatest ability: to drive play. Turcotte is able to push play with simply his skating with how explosive he becomes at top speed and his elusiveness. These abilities are so vital in today’s NHL and especially at the center position. If you have a center who can break the puck up with ease, it makes the defensemen’s job all the more simple and relieves some of the pressure they face to carry the puck. As seen by the following [data](https://public.tableau.com/profile/mitchell.brown1648#!/vizhome/CHLComparison/Dashboard3) from the fantastic [Mitchell Brown](https://twitter.com/mitchlbrown?lang=en), Turcotte enters the zone almost just as well as Jack Hughes.\n\n ![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AV-zEKNgTA2oLT07Fbdg7NidBK4=/0x0:966x434/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:966x434):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16334230/Screenshot_2019_06_11_at_6.51.03_PM.png) \n\nDespite his smaller stature at just 5’11” Turcotte consistently hovers around the crease. He’s not afraid to mix it up down low and be physical with his opposition which creates another facet that teams have to prepare for. He’s not going to be a wrecking ball out there, but he’s physical enough that defensemen are going to think twice about the guy chasing them.\n\nNot only does Turcotte wow you with his offensive abilities, he’s no slouch defensively either. His 185 pound frame allows him to compensate for his height, and makes him all the more difficult to deal with offensively and defensively. He’s routinely in position in his own zone and is relentless with his puck pursuit. His aggressive forechecking combined with his speed to recover and overall hockey instincts make him a true threat on the defensive side of the puck.\n\nHe’ll never be the goal scorer that his teammate Cole Caufield is, but his passing ability combined with scoring wingers should make for a dynamic line. Turcotte’s natural passing ability combined with his elite hockey sense to know where the puck and his teammates are and are going to be, make him a lethal threat on the offensive side of the puck. I envision him being an elite play-driving forward at the NHL level with the ability to rack up high assist numbers. Turcotte is easily (if you couldn’t tell by now) one of my favorite players of this draft class.\n\n## What’s not to like?\n\nHonestly the only true fault with Turcotte is for a centerman, he’s not the biggest guy in the world. But once again with his tenacity on the forecheck and overall pace of play, I don’t see it being a major issue. If he can get closer to the 200 pound mark and still retain his speed and explosiveness, I think it would easily compensate his height at the NHL level. If not, worst case he moves to the wing where he can still be a dynamic playmaker and solid defensive winger.\n\n## How would he fit in the [Flyers](https://www.broadstreethockey.com/)’ system?\n\nHe would be right there with Morgan Frost and Joel Farabee and that’s not even up for debate. Turcotte is by far one of the most talented forwards of this draft class and one of the most well-rounded ones as well. He would be a top prospect in the organization the moment he’d be drafted, but sadly, I can’t imagine a way he slips that far.\n\n## Could the Flyers actually get him?\n\nWhich leads me to the next point of no, I don’t conceive a way where the Flyers do get him. The only way I can envision the Flyers drafting Alex Turcotte is by trading up into the top five which doesn’t seem likely. If the Flyers are going to trade the 11th overall pick it seems more than likely it will be trading for a proven NHL talent, rather than acquiring another draft pick in the process. It would be a massive surprise if he falls even outside the top seven and hell if he slips outside of the top five I’d be on the phones immediately looking to get a deal done. The Flyers do have nine draft picks to spare, so might as well use them to get a guy like Turcotte.\n\n## Highlights\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LX-OUssDzyI?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.672147777Z","tags":null},"/reference/2019-NHL-Draft-Alex-Turcotte-Die-By-The-Blade":{"title":"","content":"\n# Draft Profile: Alex Turcotte - Die By The Blade\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e DBTB –\n \nThe Buffalo Sabres fanbase received a bit of disappointment at the NHL Draft Lottery, as they fell from #5 overall to #7.

But do not despair. The good news is that regardless of selection #5 or #7, they will add an excellent, high-end prospect to a fairly deep pool of young players.\n\nThe question is, who is that prospect?\n\nThere is a pile of players in the #3-#12 range that Jason Botterill could believably target given the Sabres need for more talent is pretty broad. All sorts of skill sets, from big playmaking centermen to small, quick goal scoring wings can be had at that #7 spot. I’ll take this opportunity to profile one here.\n\n**ALEX TURCOTTE, C, US DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM**\n\nAnother guy (see Zegras, Trevor or Boldy, Matthew) from the US Development Program who has lived in the shadow of Jack Hughes for the past two years, the 6’0 185# Turcotte spent much of last year laboring behind Hughes. He eventually took over as the U-17 top centerman and showed well once Hughes was called up to the U-18 NTDP team full-time. After his strong performance leading the U-17 team, and performing well in limited time with the U-18 team, the left-shot Turcotte came into his draft season as a guy who was thought to be a serious challenger for #2 overall. That talk got derailed early, as he went down with a nagging hip/back injury and missed the first dozen or so games for the NTDP. His return was anything but triumphant, as he immediately went down with another injury – a shoulder, presumably – in his first game back. So he missed basically the first two months before coming back right before Christmastime, an absence that saw him drop in my rankings. But once he did come back, the NTDP really threw him in the deep end, as Hughes was up with the USA World Juniors team at the time. And the Illinois native didn’t disappoint.\n\nHe finished with an eye-popping 62P in 37 games, including 27 goals. That’s actually slightly better than Hughes as far as PPG (2.17 to 2.0) which isn’t too shabby when you’re playing second fiddle to the top prospect in the Draft. Leading up to the U-18 Championships, where most scouts were waiting to see what Turcotte could do, he managed to get sick and was iffy to play right up until game-time. All he did there was put up 9P in 7 games! So he’s not only extremely skilled, but he’s a gamer! You can watch some of that action [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9N_eVbwfJY) (I apologize for the music). See what a little Thera-Flu can do?\n\nSo what does this kid bring to the table? Turcotte’s game is one of speed, power, and aggression. Has a powerful stride that recalls some of Eichel’s jaunts through the Neutral Zone. A single stride just propels him down the ice. He’s better playing a linear game where he takes a lot of straight lines than someone like a Zegras or Hughes, who have superior edges and lateral movement and lean on that to take advantage of defenders. Turcotte would rather go through you than around you. He’s got remarkable timing – he can find seams at top speed and make a good judgment about exploiting them, with or without the puck. What’s special about him is his tempo. Turcotte always plays with pace, whether offensively or defensively. His skating might not be as graceful or as dazzling as a Hughes or Zegras, but it’s the explosion and the strength of his lower body that gets him where he needs to be ahead of everyone else.\n\nBlessed with exceptional mitts, Turcotte can take bouncing pucks and turn them into pretty saucer passes or pick pucks out of the air on the fly and beat guys wide to attack the net. And attack the net he does. Not afraid of physical play, he seems to relish it, and will fearlessly power through checks or sticks to get to his spot around the cage. Around the net is where he does a lot of his damage, both in terms of scoring goals or setting them up. His play style makes it really tough to take the puck away, either in open ice or along the wall, as he uses that strong lower body much like Crosby to protect the puck from defenders and maintain his balance even against much bigger players. And in open ice, look out. He's got the burst and the superior stick handling to make a defender look silly. Intense competitor who’s motor never slows down, he understands how to manipulate a defense to get open looks while at the same time always being cognizant of his defensive responsibilities and rarely leaves open ice where the other team can get a good chance. Defensively, more than willing. Turcotte has a great feel for defending off the puck, and he’s so confident in his on-puck skills that he will happily pressure a puck carrier without any concern about losing his man or getting beat. Which rarely happens. Very good in the dot as well, I think somewhere in the 58% range. [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvR0e2wpj3c) are some more highlights from the NTDP games for your viewing pleasure.\n\nDoes this guy have a weakness? Not many. His shot is sub-par, honestly. It lacks velocity and accuracy, so he rarely uses it from distance, preferring to operate around the crease, which isn't that big of a drawback, as he's more of a pass-first guy than a shooter. Make no mistake, his speed, hands and smarts make him a very effective finisher in transition. A true puck hound, his speed and determination make him a nightmare on the forecheck but his frenetic style can lend itself to getting banged up, which may become an issue as he plays bigger opponents who can keep up with him skating-wise. In other words, he takes a lot of hits. As far as his competition, I think he’s benefited to some degree from playing behind Hughes, so he hasn’t faced as much of the best defenders night-in, night out. So I’m a little concerned about how high-end his offensive skill is: is he a Couturier/Kesler type of player, which is VERY good, or is there more? Can he carry a line and produce like a Bergeron/Couture? I’m inclined to think the former, but I would not at all be surprised by the latter. Either way, you're getting a heck of a player. If you’re looking for a comparable for Turcotte, one that always gets me is Dougie Gilmour. Not quite as aggressive as Killer (who is?), he's got the same combination of high-end speed, skill, two-way play, and desire in a similarly sized package.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.67614781Z","tags":null},"/reference/2019-NHL-Draft-Alex-Turcotte-Eyes-On-The-Prize":{"title":"","content":"\n# 2019 NHL Draft prospect: Alex Turcotte could become an elite centremen - Eyes On The Prize\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e There aren’t many players who will be taken before the American in the first round.\n\nDavid St-Louis@DavidSt_Louis\n\nMetadata: \n\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](https://www.habseyesontheprize.com/nhl-entry-draft-picks-2019/2019/6/14/18663582/alex-turcotte-2019-nhl-draft-prospect-profile-video-highlights-stats-scouting-report-analysis)\n\n---\nThe elusive number-one center. It’s said that the way to acquire one is through the draft, as rare are the occasions when a trade or a free-agent acquisition nets you the golden piece around which to build a team. Organizations have to collect their chips and play the lottery, hoping the balls fall in their favour to give them a chance at such a prospect.\n\nAlex Turcotte might not be a number-one-overall talent, but he arguably represents the best chance in the 2019 class after Jack Hughes to add a prospect with such a ceiling.\n\nBirthplace: **Island Lake, Illinois, USA**  \nDate of birth: **February 26, 2001**  \nShoots: **Left**  \nPosition: **Centre**  \nHeight: **5’11”**  \nWeight: **185 lbs.**  \nTeam: **U.S. National Team Development Program**\n\nCircumstances didn’t favour a great season from the centreman.

It makes his draft-year performance even more impressive in retrospect. His close to two-point-per-game pace with the USNTDP wasn’t surpassed by anyone other than Hughes, and Turcotte, contrary to his teammate, wasn’t always flanked with the most prolific goal-scorer in the history of the program in Cole Caufield.\n\n ![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a7E2PRhZvD0dKos8oby6ThXHal4=/0x0:554x403/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:554x403):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16343957/Screenshot_2019_06_14_Alex_Turcotte_at_eliteprospects_com.png) [EliteProspects](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/290043/alex-turcotte) \n\nFew draft-eligible prospects could clam to play the game at the same intensity as Turcotte. His high motor is backed by a solid work ethic and understanding of the game. The centreman has the same care for his play on the defensive and offensive side of the ice. He drives the play on the attack, but as soon as possession is contested, he moves back in a sound defensive position, ready to track the puck back to his zone and help his defence.\n\nHe also reads passing lanes well and closes hard on his checks, tirelessly using his stick and body to separate the opposition from possession. The forward might only be 5’11”, but he can play the game with a physical edge.\n\nThe other element that fuels Turcotte’s two-way game is his skating. He is very quick and his wide stance gives him solid balance. The drawback of that stance is that it gives him less speed due to a shorter stride when he moves in a straight line. But considering Turcotte likes to rush up and down the ice with a prominent usage of crossovers, he still has more than enough momentum to burst past defenders when joining the attack.\n\nHe is just as agile a handler as he is a skater. He can open up and pivot, once again feet wide apart to help to protect, and he attacks defenders head-on to thread the puck through their skates.\n\n_Alex Turcotte wears #19 with the USNTDP_\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/54l2wrSFvFY?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nThe first clip in the video above is especially impressive. He rushes from the wide lane, but he doesn’t continue along the wall. He crosses over to the the middle of the ice, brings the puck inside the stick and feet of a defender, then bounces off the check off the opponent and slides the puck behind him to Matthew Boldy for a scoring chance at the door-step.\n\nThere are other examples of Turcotte’s capabilities in the video: his explosive cutbacks, his abrupt change of direction, and his quick hands fending off multiple opposing stick in tight.\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OKaYcGScxsg?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nOff the rush, Turcotte is more of a playmaker, but when his team is established in the offensive zone, to find him you have to look around the net.\n\nThis is where a lot of goals are scored, and the centreman understands how to maximize his success. This season in the USNTDP, he was the net-front presence on their power play. He distinguished himself not really by superior strength or size, but with his ability to get first touch on rebounding pucks and slide to the back post, in position to be on the receiving end of the high-skill plays of his teammates.\n\nHere’s a few sequences illustrating some aspects of Turcotte’s game: his reads, his patience in possession to wait for passing lanes to open, and how he works to steal pucks, find outlets and continuously get open around the net and the slot, pushing against defenders, circling high in the zone to escape his coverage.\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SO_JvLulm_k?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nTurcotte’s highlight reel will probably never be as long as some of his teammates; he isn’t as creative or as flashy. That being said, it’s very likely that he is the second player selected from the U.S Under-18 Developmental Program at the draft, due to the many elements of his play that will translate very well to the professional game. The centreman is effective because, all over the ice, he supports his teammates and makes plays that are conducive to enxtended possession.\n\n ![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vuktPCcjQTvpWo9WftuoPhOGzLk=/0x0:470x482/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:470x482):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16336849/1.png) \n\nFrom Mitch Brown’s [CHL tracking project](https://patreon.com/user?u=13951676)\n\nIt’s therefore no surprise just how well he scores on the shot rates in the advanced stats. He is at the top of the percentile for both Corsi for (ability to generate shot attempts) and Corsi against (ability to limit shot attempts). He also dominates almost all offensive categories, which speaks to his ability to be both a playmaker and scorer depending on the situation.\n\n### Rankings (not all rankings are final)\n\nButton/TSN: **#10**  \nDobber Prospects: **#3**  \nElite Prospects: **#6**  \nFuture Considerations: **#5**  \nHockey Prospect: **#4**  \nMcKenzie/TSN: **#11**  \nNHL Central Scouting: **#4** (NA skaters)  \nPronman/The Athletic: **#3**\n\nNext year, Turcotte will play for the University of Wisconson.

Turcotte, who’s father Alfie was a first-round pick of the Montreal Canadiens in 1983, was a key contributor for both the NTDP’s under-17 and under-18 programs, including a midseason promotion to the latter where he produced 16 points in 19 games in a limited role. Turcotte is a low-maintenance center in that he can excel in both optimal and non-optimal conditions, plus handle physicality better than most offensive forwards. He is a fast, agile skater with a wide, powerful stride and the balance of a seasoned NHL power forward. Getting knocked off the puck while he’s either static or moving is something you rarely see.\n\nTurcotte possesses superior vision and passing ability, and it’s clear from his first shift that he understands the game’s intricacies and nuances that require a center to develop chemistry with his linemates. He plays smart hockey with his head on a swivel and attacks with decisiveness, maintaining situational awareness no matter how fast he’s motoring up ice. Turcotte is one of the few draft-eligible forwards who can time his passes with precision while moving as fast as he can. Although he seems to like to defer to the pass, Turcotte owns a hard, accurate wrist shot with a quick release, and he’s proven to snap off high-velocity shots within tight windows.\n\n\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NTDP?src=hash\u0026amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003e#NTDP\u003c/a\u003e: Jack Hughes (Ranked No. 1) scored twice in his return as the 18’s crushed Adrian College 8-3.

From scoring 48 points in 68 games in his first juniors season, Arthur Kaliyev went on to score 102 points, good for 6th in the OHL, and in fact seven behind current Flyer prospect Morgan Frost. Kaliyev was named to the OHL 2nd all star team, and though he still has more to prove, Kaliyev is looking like a sure fire 1st round prospect.\n\n## 2019 [NHL Draft](http://www.sbnation.com/nhl-draft) Profile: Arthur Kaliyev\n\nLeft Wing / USA / Hamilton (OHL)\n\n2018-19 Statistics: 51 G, 51 A in 67 GP\n\nSize: 6-foot-2, 190 pounds\n\n#### Pre-draft rankings\n\nNo. 7 (North American Skaters) by NHL Central Scouting\n\nNo. 30 by Future Considerations\n\nNo. 23 by ISS Hockey\n\nNo. 13 by TSN/Mckenzie\n\n### What’s there to like?\n\nKaliyev is a forward who I’d describe as simply a pure goalscorer. He possesses an excellent wrist shot, and he is effective at getting to the slot for prime scoring chances. Speaking of his shot, he picks corners like he isn’t even trying. This certainly helps when he can read offensive plays as effectively as he does. It’s not luck that he is always finding himself in good scoring positions. It’s very reminiscent of Oskar Lindblom in how effective he is at being in the right place at the right time. His mental processing of the offensive side of the game, along with the goal scoring abilities of a pure sniper, make him an incredibly dangerous weapon when crossing the opposing blue line.\n\nHe’s also improved his playmaking. Kaliyev has become far more patient with the puck, and is good at keeping the puck moving in the offensive zone. He now runs the Hamilton power play, being set up along the half-boards. Even if he is projected as a sniper, his overall offensive game is very good. There isn’t one aspect of his offensive game that I could find fault with.\n\n### What’s not to like?\n\nHe is a player that is willing to take a risk to extend a play, which is a double edged sword. When the risk doesn’t pay off, Kaliyev can get caught out of the play or give away the puck. This is more evident as well because he does not have any particularly defensively oriented instincts. While some may argue that he is there to score, not back check, Kaliyev can sometimes get into habits reminiscent of Jake Voracek on defense, which can be frustrating.\n\nHe’s probably not going to be a guy that carries a line, and will require a playmaking center to feed him the puck. In fairness, this can be said about a lot of wingers. He’s good at taking on defenders one on one, but this isn’t always a reliable skill in the more bruising NHL.\n\n### How would he fit in the [Flyers](https://www.broadstreethockey.com/)’ system?\n\nThere’s one type of player the Flyers lack: a true sniper. Kaliyev would fulfill this role, and would look to project into a very good first line scorer. Imagining Giroux regresses, the first line could be Kaliyev-Couturier-Konecny. The thought of that delights me. Heck, eventually, it could even be Kaliyev-Frost-Konecny. I would like one order of that, please.\n\n### Could the Flyers actually get him?\n\nIf they don’t trade the pick, they absolutely could. It would be a surprising pick, given Kaliyev’s ranking, but it’s 100% possible. Teams like to draft more important positions like center and defense high in the first round, rather than scoring wingers. But, given the Flyers’ organizational needs, I wouldn’t object to the Flyers shocking everybody and taking Kaliyev early. It won’t happen, but hey I can dream.\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TwnkMElynFo?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.67614781Z","tags":null},"/reference/2019-NHL-Draft-Arthur-Kaliyev-Eyes-On-The-Prize":{"title":"","content":"\n# 2019 NHL Draft: Questions linger about Arthur Kaliyev’s NHL projections - Eyes On The Prize\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e Kaliyev has feasted on Junior defence, but there are a few signs that he will be able to adapt to better competition.\n\nDavid St-Louis@DavidSt_Louis\n\nMetadata: \n\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](https://www.habseyesontheprize.com/nhl-entry-draft-picks-2019/2019/6/13/18662114/arthur-kaliyev-2019-nhl-draft-prospect-profile-video-highlights-stats-scouting-report-analysis)\n\n---\nPolarizing is the appropriate word to describe Arthur Kaliyev. Depending on the method used to evaluate him — a more analytics-intensive approach or scouting for tools, game sense, and projectability — Kaliyev can either come out as one of the better potential picks in the draft or one with a lot of question marks, some would say even red flags.\n\nBirthplace: **Tashkent, Uzbekistan**  \nDate of birth: **June 26, 2001**  \nShoots: **Left**  \nPosition: **Wing**  \nHeight: **6’2”**  \nWeight: **190 lbs.**  \nTeam: **Hamilton Bulldogs (OHL)**\n\nThe main issue in ranking Kaliyev is that he operates quietly. He isn’t a _put your head down, hustle, and skate the puck into the net_ kind of player. He isn’t a power foward who overpowers his peers in front of the net (even if his stature would suggest he could be), and he isn’t a flashy dangler who goes through entire teams to score.\n\nKaliyev drifts, glides, floats away from the sight of the opposing team and, to an extent, spectators, and comes up with a few goals, inflating his totals higher and higher, forcing eyes onto him after they glance at the stat sheet to figure out just what is going on.\n\nHe is quite unique. It’s hard to reconcile 51 goals — an incredible feat for a draft-eligible player, one that hasn’t been matched by many over the years and puts him in company of players like Alex DeBrincat and Jeff Skinner — to what appears to be a detached playstyle. The sheer numbers are impressive, but will he be able to replicate his success as he rises in the levels of hockey?\n\n ![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sbhri9HfaWJX2B4jPJuWoaMijaI=/0x0:768x176/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:768x176):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16341162/Screenshot_2019_06_12_Arthur_Kaliyev_at_eliteprospects_com.png) [EliteProspects](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/316114/arthur-kaliyev) \n\nThe number-one element that will help him score goals at the next level is his shot. Kaliyev is a deadly weapon from the right faceoff circle, his off-side as a left-shot winger. He scored 20 of his 51 goals on the power play, and a good part of those markers where from that position.\n\nKaliyev fires pucks with a short-windup slapshot. He understands that the most important aspect of his release is speed: how quickly he can get a puck sliding toward him to fly to the net before the goalie has time to get to his left post. He takes a quick peek at the net as he is about to receive a pass and adjusts his shot to best have it slip by the netminder’s coverage.\n\nThe first sequence in the video below has a great camera angle of Kaliyev’s work at the right circle. He stands very low in the zone, below the dot and closer to the goal line. It doesn’t give him as much net to shoot at, but it’s the furthest distance for the goalie to travel to block his shot. As the puck slides to him, he engages the rotation of his body by opening up his hips and pointing his right foot toward the net, adding power to his shot but still controlling his release to place the puck between the post and the glove of the goalie.\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tjc2C07lhXY?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nThat’s not to say that Kaliyev can’t just hammer it home, which he does a couple of times in the video from the same power-play spot. He simply adapts his release to the situation. There’s a clip in the video where the winger one-times a pass that falls completely behind him, strictly using his body rotation to get it on net. He also chooses a catch-and-release wrist-shot motion when he feels that more elevation will be necessary to beat the goalie. Finally, when he faces a fully-set netminder, his shot becomes a playmaking weapon. He shoots for rebounds, keeping the puck low or transforming his firing motion into a hard pass to the back post for a tap-in attempt, and fakes using his release to thread a pass to teammates in the slot.\n\nHe can take the puck through the defence himself at times. He will chain a few rapid moves to thread the puck inside opposing sticks and skates and get a one-on-one chance with the goalie. But he is at his best when being set up.\n\nThe winger is all about finding quiet ice. He controls his skating, trying to join the attack deceptively and remain unchecked for the longest time possible. This is how he scores his goals at even strength. Being left alone in the offensive zone can be a product of some lapses in defensive coverage — and there are a lot of them in Junior hockey — but also of the skating routes he chooses and his ability to anticipate offensive and defensive schemes.\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NVj2RquiNjY?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nIn the clips above, you can see Kaliyev slow down, move east-west to remain in a passing lane, or change the position of his stick (bringing it behind him, for example) to create a new seam in which to receive the puck. He also waits for the defence to be pushed back before drifting into the zone. Trailing the play gives him space to get closer to the net and fire. When the puck gets to the point, the winger doesn’t immediately rush the net, but aims to arrive at the back post at the same time as the blue-line shot hits the net. Stick on the ice, he gets prime rebound occasions.\n\nThose natural tendencies contribute to making him the goal-scorer that he is. Being able to find and create space and time yourself for the best opportunities are skills. The drawback is that it makes him play at a slower pace compared to his peers, and this is where the common questions surrounding the prospect come from.\n\nKaliyev is the guy who will sometime forfeit defensive positioning or a battle for a loose puck to take a step toward the offence, anticipating or hoping that his team wins possession and he gets an opportunity to set himself up for a scoring chance at the other end of the ice. The good ones start from rapid transitions, and he definitely knows that. The winger can also force some passes as he takes the puck from zone to zone, as his preferred play is to arrive as the shooting option in the offensive zone.\n\nIt comes down to this: It’s rare to see the scorer use the full extent of his motor. Sometimes it’s for good reason (as in the above examples of his goals), but other times it would benefit him to raise the tempo. He isn’t a top skater, but even considering his upright form and his lack of knee-bend, Kaliyev can still muster some speed, especially with the usage of crossovers.\n\nAlthough the player he is up against in this sequence is Kevin Bahl (who isn’t exactly a speedster), you can see Kaliyev, enticed by the breakaway opportunity, separate with quick bursts and take the puck to the net.\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4XZOWmAQyqY?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nHis shot should allow him to produce at the NHL level, but if he wants to have further success and feature on the goal-scoring leaderboard he will have to adjust his feel for where the space is in the offensive zone and his goal-scoring timing to the much higher pace. That will require him to work on his skating and generally play the game a few higher gears.\n\nThe faith in his capacity to do that is reflected in the rankings of the prospect over different scouting services.\n\n### Rankings (not all rankings are final)\n\nButton/TSN: **#13**  \nDobber Prospects: **#18**  \nElite Prospects: **#11**  \nFuture Considerations: **#30**  \nHockey Prospect: **#34**  \nMcKenzie/TSN: **#13**  \nNHL Central Scouting: **#7** (NA skaters)  \nPronman/The Athletic: **#14**\n\nOn draft day, it’s likely that Kaliyev falls in the middle of the first round due to the risk he represents. There are other top prospects who don’t have the same concerns about their intensity who will likely go before the goal-scorer, but the package of skill he has also won’t let him fall too far in the first round.\n\nIt’s possible one lottery team with more analytically inclined views could find hidden value in the player. The dominant production that places him in somewhat elite company is one thing, but Kaliyev also comes out as quite an interesting prospect in Mitch Brown’s CHL tracking project.\n\n ![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3pcVoagCCMrGELgwM2fdyWILCq4=/0x0:471x472/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:471x472):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16334342/2.png) \n\nFrom Mitch Brown’s [CHL tracking project](https://www.patreon.com/user/posts?u=13951676)\n\nAs expected, he’s near the top of all shooting categories, but the passing grades also paint him as capable playmaker and transition skater, especially when it comes to getting the puck in the offensive zone.\n\nWhat’s really interesting is the entry defence category. Kaliyev scores highly in backchecking involvement, which runs counter to what is often perceived as a weakness in his game. This can’t be interpreted as proof of a strong two-way game for the forward since it’s supplementary information, but it’s still interesting to note his effectiveness in tracking pucks back and breaking plays in the neutral zone.\n\nHis playmaking capabilities, those defensive stats, and his work at times on the penalty kill could be good indications that there is more to Kaliyev than his goal-scoring identity. He represents an interesting project to take on for a team’s development staff as they look to broaden his game and push it to the next level to match how he will have to perform against professionals.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.67614781Z","tags":null},"/reference/2019-NHL-Draft-Arthur-Kaliyev-RSN":{"title":"","content":"\n# 2019 NHL draft profile: What's the read on Arthur Kaliyev? | RSN\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e The 2019 NHL entry draft is Friday and Saturday in Vancouver, British Columbia.

General manager Chuck Fletcher, assistant general manager Brent Flahr and the Flyers hold the 11th overall pick and eight selections in total.T\n\n\"This draft's a little unique,\" Flahr said last week. \"Especially in the top 15, there are a number of different types of players, which is interesting — some power wingers, some smaller scoring wingers, some centermen, there's a number of D, a goaltender.\n\n\"We've identified probably five or six guys that we think have a chance to be there at 11 and probably some of the other teams in front of us will dictate that. But we're really confident we're going to get a good player.\"\n\nThis week, we are breaking down options for the Flyers at No. 11.\n\n## **Arthur Kaliyev**\n\n**Position:** Right winger  \n**Height:** 6-foot-2  \n**Weight:** 194  \n**Shoots:** Left  \n**Team:** Hamilton\n\n### **Scouting report**\n\nKaliyev might be the second-best goal-scorer in the draft behind only USNTDP product Cole Caufield.\n\nThere's a lot to like with the New York native, from his size to his shot. He understands angles and spacing as he scored 51 goals in 67 regular-season games for the OHL's Hamilton Bulldogs. Kaliyev isn't just a finisher, either. He tallied 51 assists, giving him 102 points on the season.\n\nThis was an interesting tidbit on Kaliyev from [TSN's Bob McKenzie](https://www.tsn.ca/americans-set-to-dominate-first-round-of-the-nhl-draft-1.1323878):\n\n\u003e Inconsistency of effort has created a polarizing effect among scouts. In the TSN survey of 10 scouts, one had Kaliyev in the top 10 and another had him outside the top 40. The others had him spread out in between, totaling six votes in the first round and four in the second. No other prospect ranked in the first round has such a wide variance.\n\nNHL Central Scouting has Kaliyev ranked as the seventh-best North American skater, ahead of Caufield, Matthew Boldy and Peyton Krebs.\n\n### **Fit with Flyers**\n\nKaliyev has been a teammate of Flyers prospect Matthew Strome the past two seasons, so the club's development and scouting staff has likely seen a good bit of the winger.\n\nIt all comes down to what the Flyers think of Kaliyev (as well as the teams ahead of them).\n\nThere aren't a ton of flawless teenage prospects. Kaliyev will turn 18 years old next week and his game/effort in all three zones can be worked on over time.\n\nThere's no doubt a 51-goal scorer in just his second year of junior hockey is intriguing.","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.67614781Z","tags":null},"/reference/2019-NHL-Draft-Arthur-Kaliyev-The-Draft-Analyst":{"title":"","content":"\n# 2019 Draft Profile: RW Arthur Kaliyev : The Draft Analyst\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e One of the top wingers for the 2019 NHL Draft is shredding the OHL after an impressive rookie season a year ago.\n\n\n\nMetadata: \n\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](https://www.thedraftanalyst.com/2019-nhl-draft/2019-draft-profile-rw-arthur-kaliyev/)\n\n---\n**2019 NHL Draft**\n\n### Arthur Kaliyev\n\n### **Hamilton Bulldogs (OHL)**\n\n**Steve Kournianos**  |  10/08/2018 |  Nashville  |  \\[hupso\\]\n\nPhoto courtesy of Terry Wilson/OHL Images\n\n![](https://www.thedraftanalyst.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/arthur-kaliyev.jpg \"arthur-kaliyev\")\n\nProfile\n\n**Position:** Right Wing  \n**Shoots**: Left  \n**Height / Weight**: 6’1, 190 lbs  \n**Born:** June 26th, 2001 | Delray Beach, FL  \n**Nation:** United States\n\n\nScouting Report\n\nA goal-scoring winger with an excellent shot, Kaliyev was impressive last season as a rookie for the Hamilton Bulldogs, who won the OHL postseason title and nearly captured the Memorial Cup. His 30 goals were the most by any 16-year-old OHL’er since Alex Galchenyuk scored 31 for Sarnia in 2010-11. There are several aspects of Kaliyev’s game that stand out, namely his shot and ability to get open for clean looks at the net. He can finish in a variety of ways on both his forehand and backhand, and his one-timer from the circles is devastatingly accurate. Kaliyev’s ability to make quick bursts to the net from a static position creates a dilemma for defenders, since affording him too much room to shoot is equally as dangerous and playing him tight.\n\nAlthough Kaliyev has a strong upper body and powerful leg drive, he isn’t a physically-intimidating power forward. He uses his above-average speed and stickhandling to quickly counter up ice and maintain possession while being harassed, but you wouldn’t classify him as a crease crasher. Kaliyev spends a significant amount of time away from puck battles but can hold him own in the corners. He has soft hands and is a very good passer for a sniper, and Kaliyev appears to develop immediate chemistry with any center or linemate. Kaliyev likely isn’t the first player a coach will summon to kill a penalty or suffocate an opponent’s late-period rally, but his goal scoring ability for a teenager most certainly is elite.\n\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AAPG?src=hash\u0026amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003e#AAPG\u003c/a\u003e: C Alex Turcotte (Ranked No. 3) slows it down, jukes a few times before sending a perfect pass to LW Arthur Kaliyev (Ranked No. 18), who blisters one past Dustin Wolf. \u003ca href=\"https://t.co/1rgP26zdka\"\u003epic.twitter.com/1rgP26zdka\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u0026mdash; Steve Kournianos (@TheDraftAnalyst) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDraftAnalyst/status/1042571999883800576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eSeptember 20, 2018\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e \u003cscript async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.67614781Z","tags":null},"/reference/2019-NHL-Draft-Trevor-Zegras-Broad-Street-Hockey":{"title":"","content":"\n# 2019 NHL Draft Profile: Trevor Zegras, an American two-way forward with exceptional skating ability - Broad Street Hockey\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e Another American could crack the top 10.\n\nJohanGartner@JohanGartner\n\nMetadata: \n\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](https://www.broadstreethockey.com/2019/6/14/18661567/2019-nhl-draft-profile-trevor-zegras-a-two-way-forward-with-exceptional-skating-ability-american)\n\n---\nThe US National U18 team has a lot of really good prospects this year with the likes of [Jack Hughes](https://www.broadstreethockey.com/2019/6/12/18662032/2019-nhl-draft-profile-the-jack-hughes-and-kaapo-kakko-experience-is-upon-us-chuck-fletcher-flyers) and [Cole Caufield](https://www.broadstreethockey.com/2019/6/13/18677146/cole-caufield-draft-profile-stats-analysis-highlights-2019-nhl-draft) leading the way. Another really good prospect is the Bedford, NY native Trevor Zegras, who is projected to go early in the first round. Lets have a look and see if he could be someone the [Flyers](https://www.broadstreethockey.com/) might have interest in for this upcoming draft.\n\n#### **BSH 2019 Draft Profile: Trevor Zegras**\n\n**Position/Team:** C/W / US National U18 Team (Boston University commit)\n\n**2018-19 Statistics:** 26 G 61 A, in 60 GP\n\n**Size:** 6’0” 174 lbs\n\n#### **Pre-draft rankings**\n\n#5 [Hockeyprospect.com](https://www.eliteprospects.com/draft-center/2019/hockeyprospect.com)\n\n#8 [Future Considerations](https://www.eliteprospects.com/draft-center/2019/future-considerations)\n\n#10 [ISS hockey](https://www.eliteprospects.com/draft-center/2019/iss-hockey)\n\n#6 [McKeens hockey](https://www.eliteprospects.com/draft-center/2019/mckeen-s-hockey)\n\n#8 [Bob McKenzie](https://www.tsn.ca/hughes-kakko-in-tight-race-for-top-spot-1.1284470)\n\n## What’s there to like?\n\nWhere to start? Zegras is, first of all, a two-way forward with terrific skating ability. His mobility helps him dictate the play and his first step or two really sets him apart from other players. He loves to get under the skin of the opponents, and while he is mainly a playmaker, he has great hand-eye coordination and he is dangerous with deflections around the net — great hockey IQ.\n\nZegras takes pride in his defensive play and he uses the great speed of his to back-check and position himself where he is needed. He reads the plays really well and uses his active stick to create turnovers for counter-attacks. He has that ability to “always be on the right side of the puck”. He also relies on his smarts and speed all over the ice which always makes him a threat.\n\n## What’s not to like?\n\nZegras is a very well-rounded player who has the tools to become a very good NHL player, but he may need a year or two at Boston University to continue to work on his game and bulk up. He can be a perimeter player in the offensive zone at times, which is something that might fix itself when he gets stronger.\n\n## How would he fit in the Flyers’ system?\n\nFlyers are still working on signing Kevin Hayes to fill the second line center role, and if he signs the Flyers will be pretty stacked at center, especially with Morgan Frost in the pipeline as well. The good thing with Zegras is that he’s very flexible and can also play the wing, which is where he would most likely play if the Flyers drafted him.\n\n## Could the Flyers actually get him?\n\nZegras has been ranked anywhere between fifth and tenth depending on which ranking you check, and while there’s a possibility that he can fall all the way to 11th, I’d be surprised if he actually went outside of the top 10. His skill-set, along with him playing a “pro game” already, will help his chances of being drafted before it’s the Flyers turn to pick.\n\n## **Highlights**\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hH6XFpEhLr4?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.67614781Z","tags":null},"/reference/2019-NHL-Draft-Trevor-Zegras-Die-By-The-Blade":{"title":"","content":"\n# Draft Profile: Trevor Zegras - Die By The Blade\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e DBTB –\n \nThe Buffalo Sabres fanbase received a bit of disappointment at the NHL Draft Lottery, as they fell from #5 overall to #7.

But do not despair. The good news is that regardless of selection #5 or #7, they will add an excellent, high-end prospect to a fairly deep pool of young players.\n\nThe question is, who is that prospect?\n\nThere is a pile of players in the #3-#12 range that Jason Botterill could believably target given the Sabres need for more talent is pretty broad. All sorts of skill sets, from big playmaking centermen to small, quick goal scoring wings can be had at that #7 spot. I’ll take this opportunity to profile one here.\n\n**TREVOR ZEGRAS, C/LW, US DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM**\n\nA 5’11 1/2, 170# left-shot forward who is comfortable in the middle or on the wing, Zegras is a 2001-born player from downstate in Bedford, New York. An absolutely dynamite playmaking forward, he’s one of the top passers in the Draft Class. Most importantly, he can make elite plays at top speed. Has been very good all year, having scored the game-winner at the All-American Top Prospects game at the start of the season, and named the best player for the USA at the 5 Nations tournament in February. Notched an impressive 87 points in 60 games for the NTDP, shockingly only 4th on the NTDP in terms of points-per-game. Added 9 points in 5 games for the US in the Under-18 World Championships, despite coming off a shoulder injury in the preliminary games that kept him out of the first couple of round-robin games in that tournament. You can catch some of those highlights [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klPcg4P0m7w). That pass starting at 00:25 seconds is ridiculous.\n\nZegras possesses an uncanny knack for understanding space, creating it, and using it to his advantage. Misdirection is one of the most important weapons in his arsenal. Uses a variety of fakes, look offs, and changes of direction to distract opponents while putting sauce right on the tape of his linemates. Even on simple plays, he will throw in a small flourish – a change of pace, or a look-away, to freeze a defender for a half-second. He’s almost over-confident with the puck, as he’ll make behind-the-back passes, between his legs, no-look or try to saucer a pass through a half-dozen sticks when he sees an opening, and more often than not can put the puck into areas of the ice where only his teammates can reach it and turn it into a positive play. Very smart player who reads the defense instantly and finds a counter. Wizard-like hands are always in motion, and he’s equally good on his fore- or back-hand. Can dangle you to death with his incredible stick-handling.\n\nOne of the top skaters in the Class, he’s super quick and can explode out of a dead stop or changes in direction. He moves laterally with both ease and sharpness, and every stride seems designed to get him an advantage. Using his lateral mobility he can protect the puck by driving off defenders with speed or stepping around them. Will walk a defender to the outside, but Zegras prefers to threaten to go by a defender, get them on their heels, and then pull up to open up all kinds of space for himself to find a teammate. Thanks to his ridiculous handle and that skating, he can create clean zone entries at will. He’s particularly dangerous running the Power Play off the half-wall or at the point, with his NTDP coach pointing out that Zegras will be the best special teams player on whatever college team he goes to right out of the box (FYI – he’ll be at Boston University next season). High praise. You can check out some of his game (without Hughes) [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-jv-71HZLM).\n\nA feature to his game he shares with Eichel is his ability to think the game at high speed. He recognizes openings and defenses even when skating full steam and has the presence of mind always try making a play rather than play it safe.\n\nAll that said, he’s still got some blemishes to his game. Some will claim his gaudy numbers are a result of playing with Jack Hughes, but he drove his own line for more than a few games this season with Hughes out for the [World Juniors](https://www.sbnation.com/world-junior-hockey) and Turcotte out with injury. You might be able to say that Hughes’ gaudy stats might not be so impressive without Zegras feeding him. So he doesn’t need to play with great players, but his playmaking ability is best employed when he’s skating with other talented offensive players who know where to be on the ice. He isn’t a pure goal scorer, and can tend to overpass, leaving good scoring opportunities on the table in favor of the extra pass. He’ll need to pick his spots better as the competition improves. Looking to shoot more often would help, but he doesn’t have a big shot. In fact, his clapper is rather pedestrian, and although he’s very accurate in picking spots, neither his wrist shot nor his release are exceptional. Yet there’s an that innate sense of where the puck is, and he can find it in a crowd and lift it in a second with those butter-soft hands of his.\n\nZegras is dogged on the puck, which makes him a very dangerous forechecker and very willing backchecker. That said, he needs some work when defending off the puck, where he can get too eager to blow the zone and loses his guy. In a way, his defensive game resembles [Jeff Skinner](https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/297073/jeff-skinner). As a very accomplished puck possession player, he’s still very slight (6’0, 170#), so he can get pushed around pretty easily by bigger D-Men and forwards on the wall, and all the slick moves in the world won’t help when you’re pinned against the boards. So he’ll need to bulk up.\n\nZegras is a true game breaker. To me, the only player who has a better pure skill/speed combination in this Draft is Jack Hughes.\n\nThis is a FanPost written by a member of the community.

That includes the team’s season in the USHL and contests against NCAA opponents. He also ended the year with nine points in five games at the World Under-18 Championship after missing the start of the tournament due to injury.\n\n ![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lp7AboLFKMatStlPitwaFPhx7rI=/0x0:549x318/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:549x318):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16234408/Screenshot_2019_05_10_Trevor_Zegras_at_eliteprospects_com.png) [EliteProspects](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/424453/trevor-zegras) \n\nWhat drives Zegras’s offensive success is his passing ability. The forward can make very difficult feeds look easy with his incredible vision. This talent makes him stand out from just about everyone else in this 2019 draft class. Rare are the games when he doesn’t impress one way or another with beautiful setups that would not be attempted by most players, or even occur to them.\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1yX9e9lZqHA?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nTake a look at this collection of plays made by the forward during the season. Zegras can use his backhand or forehand just as efficiently to set up a lot of different passes:\n\n-   Send the puck into space for a teammate to skate into;\n-   Use the boards to make indirect feeds halfway across the ice;\n-   Challenge the defence to create a pocket behind him in which to drop the puck, giving a teammate a chance to release from the slot;\n-   Do the same, but instead follow it by lobbing a pass to a teammate driving to the net;\n-   Slide the puck across the Royal Road (from one side of the ice to the other) through multiple sticks and skates, or;\n-   Spin on himself, or go through his legs inside the defensive coverage, to create passing lanes that weren’t previously there.\n\nHe shows a lot of diversity and creativity in his feeds. It allowed him to collect assists at a rhythm of better than one per game.\n\nZegras isn’t overly deceptive in his passes, contrary to many other playmakers who rely on manipulating the defence to open passing lanes. Instead, on top of his ingenuity he relies on his precision, his quick execution, and a stickhandling ability that rivals some of the best handlers in the draft to create many of his memorable plays.\n\nThose abilities also allow him to create chances for himself. He combines his shifty handling with heel pushes and turns within his wide-skating base to get inside the sticks and skates of defenders, constantly altering his stick grip to adjust his manoeuvres as opponent’s flail away at the puck.\n\nHere are a few sequences taken from both games versus the Russian Under-18 team that showcase Zegras’s hands.\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ngNGecoiZ_0?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nThe forward would be even more dangerous if he were to combine his attacks with the speed he possesses more often. As he consistently looks for passing targets, he slows down upon entering the offensive zone to look for support, exploiting the space between the defenders and the backcheck that was present at his level of play but won’t be as common at higher levels. By keeping his feet moving, using his high agility and finding a better mix between shooting and passing, Zegras would be just as dangerous with the puck on his stick against better opponents; no matter their defensive response, he would have an answer.\n\nIt’s a safe bet that he will learn to adapt as the challenges grow. He is incredibly skilled, and he could be counted on for different roles inside the U.S. National Team Development Program. He played both on the wing and at centre this season, and some of his best games came when he acted as the number-one center for the team during Jack Hughes’s absence for the [World Juniors](https://www.sbnation.com/world-junior-hockey). In that time, Zegras showed himself capable of playing a solid two-way game while retaining the full force of his offence.\n\nHe is capable of some physical play, but most of his defensive success comes from timely stick lifts while tracking the puck back to his zone, stealing it in between blue lines to immediately spring his team on offence.\n\nThis ability was reflected in his advanced stats. The forward was one of the most involved in the backcheck in all of the tracked data. Looking broadly at the numbers, his offensive prowess also led to him ranking at the top of many scoring categories, especially the ones related to playmaking: expected primary assists, shot assists, and one-timer assists.\n\n ![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DqK7pFrfXpgpnqn2SB_nZFg-nN4=/0x0:474x477/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:474x477):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16212369/1.png) \n\nFrom Mitch Brown’s [tracking project](https://www.patreon.com/user/overview?u=13951676)\n\nIn June, Zegras is projected to be selected in the top 10 of the draft by many scouting services. His passing talent makes him a very desirable target for a team looking for help on the power play or a setup man for their shooters. That being said, it’s also possible to see the USNTDP forward fall slightly outside the projections to an organization picking in the middle of the first round.

It’s what I’m really good at.\"\n\n**NHL player comparable:** Patrick Kane\n\n**Fit for Blackhawks:**\n\nTalk to any player on USA Hockey's National Team Development Program and they'll say Zegras was the most offensively gifted player of the group, which is saying a lot when you consider some of the names he's up against (Matthew Boldy, Cole Caufield, Jack Hughes, Alex Turcotte, to name a few).\n\nAt the NHL scouting combine, Zegras mentioned Kane several times as somebody he tries modeling his game after. The vision, the passing, the skating, the playmaking ability, the hockey IQ. He has it all offensively, and also doesn't get enough credit for his two-way game.\n\nZegras is somebody that has quickly been rising on draft boards, and it's because he has the potential to be a 90-point player in the NHL as a center. His name has been discussed by the Blackhawks at No. 3 and he's certainly a tempting option. Pair Zegras with Kane for the next decade and it's scary to think about the numbers the two could put up together.","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.67614781Z","tags":null},"/reference/2019-NHL-Draft-Trevor-Zegras-The-Draft-Analyst":{"title":"","content":"\n# 2019 Draft Profile: C Trevor Zegras : The Draft Analyst\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e 2019 NHL Draft\n\n\n\nMetadata: \n\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](https://www.thedraftanalyst.com/2019-nhl-draft/2019-draft-profile-c-trevor-zegras/)\n\n---\n**2019 NHL Draft**\n\n### Trevor Zegras\n\n### **U.S. U18 (NTDP)**\n\n**Steve Kournianos**  |  09/04/2018 |  Nashville  |  \\[hupso\\]\n\nPhoto courtesy of Rena Laverty\n\n![](https://www.thedraftanalyst.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Zegras-PIC-RENA-690x438.jpg \"Zegras PIC - RENA\")\n\nProfile\n\n**Position:** Center  \n**Shoots**: Left  \n**Height / Weight**: 6’0, 167 lbs  \n**Born:** March 20th, 2001 | Bedford, NY  \n**Nation:** United States\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"895\" height=\"503\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i7DwgB23YVk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n\nScouting Report\n\nSlick playmaking center with exceptional hockey sense who last year took over the NTDP’s top line after Jack Hughes and Alex Turcotte were promoted, and spent a good chunk of this season as a left wing. Zegras, who is committed to Boston University, is very dangerous with the puck and appears quite comfortable handling the responsibilities inherent in leading a talented squad’s offense. He is both crafty and fancy with the puck, and his passes almost always are on the tape with authority. Zegras’s pass accuracy remains consistent anywhere on the ice and he’s just as dangerous threading the needle while manning the half wall as he is in open ice. His ability to stickhandle while keeping his head up allows him to be the first to identify trailers or back-door cutters, and Zegras will use no-look centering passes on the power play to exploit an open passing lane. He’s also capable of tricking goalies with a hard, accurate shot that he can tuck under the bar from bad angles.\n\nZegras plays engaged with or without the puck and stays in motion in all three zones. He locks in on the puck regardless of where it is or whether or not he’s in control. Once he’s corralled it, Zegras can use a variety of stutter steps, gear changes or pirouettes to motor past, around or through traffic. His agility is outstanding, and he always seems to make the right reads when anticipating puck travel. Zegras is a strong, agile skater with very good straight-line speed who can stay low to the ice and maintain his elite balance as he zips through the neutral zone into opposing territory. His zone entries are surgical and designed to create time and space while maintaining possession. He is very good on faceoffs and will play physical along the boards. Zegras also has a mean streak and will get involved in scrums after the whistle.\n\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/U18?src=hash\u0026amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003e#U18\u003c/a\u003e: Happy Greek Easter to Trevor Zegras (Ranked No. 4) who flashes his skill with a neat pass to Cam York for an absolute laser.

The way in which he plays the game can immediately translate to the NHL and his terrific skill set will allow him to play the same style effectively against the best in the world.\n\nByfield’s case is different.\n\n### Beginning with the end in mind\n\nTo paraphrase the concept from _The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People_, we need to first understand what we are looking to get out of Byfield as an NHLer. By elaborating on our expectations and laying out the ideal outcome of his development process, we’ll have a better idea of what to prioritize.\n\n_Byfield’s best-case scenario in the NHL:_\n\n_1) Plays center_\n\n_2) Is a plus-value contributor both special teams_\n\n_3) Challenges for 20 minutes of ice time or more per game_\n\n_4) Scores at at a point-per-game pace once his game is at maturity_\n\n**If we were to throw Byfield into the fire at the start of the 2020-21 season, I anticipate that he will fail on all four counts.**\n\n### Show me how you move; tell me who you are\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hZNswSiGo94?rel=0\u0026amp;autoplay=0\u0026amp;showinfo=0\u0026amp;enablejsapi=0\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" gesture=\"media\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowautoplay=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"728\" height=\"409\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nAbove are Byfield’s first two shifts against the Niagara Ice Dogs on February 28, 2020 (video via InStat).\n\nThe sequences are fairly representative of Byfield’s overall game - his exceptional acceleration, strength and reach are on display, and he looks to be a factor all over the ice by hounding the puck aggressively.\n\n[![Future Watch: top ten 2020 draft prospects to watch at the Hlinka ...](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a7ac87b-ce5c-423c-b112-1e65d412c4fb_900x600.jpeg \"Future Watch: top ten 2020 draft prospects to watch at the Hlinka ...\")](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a7ac87b-ce5c-423c-b112-1e65d412c4fb_900x600.jpeg)\n\n_(Image: Terry Wilson, OHL Images)_\n\nBut once he gets a first touch on the puck, Byfield becomes his own worst enemy.

But the Russian’s posture is more vertical, allowing him to keep his chin up and to go from free skating to puck handling with a minimum of fuss.\n\nMalkin’s shoulders are roughly in line with his knees, while Byfield’s shoulders are way in front, preventing him from rotation on-axis and shift laterally on his first touch.\n\nByfield’s postural issue flares up in other aspects of the game. Because his center of gravity is way forward, he has trouble loading his ankles and staying low through sharp turns. When he decides to cut back to shake off a defender, he straightens his legs, then quickly sinks his pelvis to dig into the ice and change direction. This is sub-optimal because an NHL caliber defenseman can either push him off the puck as he lifts his body or catch up to him and get a stick on the puck when he slows to a near-standstill in the middle of his turn.\n\nThe huge variability in his posture throughout a possession might even have positional implications. Give Byfield a quick pass on his backhand low in the defensive zone and see what happens: he stiffens up, his feet get stuck and he bobbles the puck. Hardly ideal for a center who is counted on to be flawless under pressure on breakouts.\n\n_Byfield’s worst-case scenario in the NHL:_\n\n_1) Plays left wing_\n\n_2) Is a middle-six forechecking specialist_\n\n_3) Plays 10-14 minutes per game, mostly in a shutdown and PK role_\n\n_4) Scores less than 30 points a year_\n\nWhat I’m describing above is still a tremendously valuable player. But it would a far cry from what Byfield’s capable of.\n\nAny NHL coach can do a job of channeling Byfield’s exceptional athleticism and hunger into hunting for loose pucks, taking the body and killing the opposing team’s offensive sequences.\n\nBut it will take some doing to help Byfield use his skills to create as opposed to destroy.\n\n### Embrace the chaos\n\nIn _The Art of Learning_, chess prodigy and martial arts champion Josh Waitzkin describes a particular challenge in his journey toward excellence:\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d4827fc-bb57-41cc-9744-1e2793c62bd5_550x205.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d4827fc-bb57-41cc-9744-1e2793c62bd5_550x205.png)[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F172c5608-5e2a-42a7-a9b5-e90958bbd973_534x328.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F172c5608-5e2a-42a7-a9b5-e90958bbd973_534x328.png)\n\nWaitzkin was never quite able to reconcile Dvoretsky and Razuvaev’s opposing views through the medium of chess. He was an attacking, daring, creative player who loved chaos and relished the process of finding solutions while his opponents sat stumped. But he was coached to play a structured, patient and _prophylactic_ game that wasn’t his. The outcome was predetermined. While Waitzkin was one of the best young players in the world, he never reached his potential as a senior and left chess to pursue an entirely different discipline.\n\nByfield is similar in the sense that he still plays a raw, instinctive, major-junior style of hockey as opposed to the fast but intensely structured version of the sport we see at the NHL level. He is at his best capitalizing on broken plays and sniffing for offense in the grey areas of the play rather than confined to a spot and told to wait his turn.\n\nFor him to be a star the game should flow freely like rapids. This is against the instincts of NHL coaches who seek to control the ebb and flow of the game and remove unexpected elements in the name of _consistency._\n\nTechnically Byfield will need to change _his_ game. But tactically he should be given a chance to change _the_ game_._\n\n### The Plan\n\nHere what I suggest:\n\n-   Byfield plays the entire next season in the OHL, aiming to be the best player on the best team in the country.\n    \n-   Whichever NHL team drafts him hires an player development analyst to break down every game and a player development coach to skate with him every week.\n    \n-   Byfield does not play an NHL game until his technical mastery matches that of Malkin at age 20, his first year in Pittsburgh (85 points, Rookie of the Year).\n    \n-   In his first NHL season his KPI is the number of possessions (touches) per 60 minutes of ice time - any defensive shortcomings will only be evaluated through the prism of “is he getting enough pucks?”\n    \n\nAfter that the rest will take care of itself.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.67614781Z","tags":null},"/reference/2020-NHL-Draft-Kasper-Smontival-The-Draft-Analyst":{"title":"","content":"\n# 2020 Draft: Top Prospects (Finland) : The Draft Analyst\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e Finland continues to produce premier NHL talent and the 2020 draft is no different.\n\nNortheastern Hockey Blog@NUHockeyBlog·February 12, 2022\n\nMetadata: \n\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](https://www.thedraftanalyst.com/2020-nhl-draft/2020-draft-top-prospects-finland/)\n\n---\nKasper Simontaival  \nRight Wing | Tappara U20, Nuorten SM-Liiga | 5’9, 177 | 1/11/02 | 41gp-20g-25a-45pts\n\n![](https://www.thedraftanalyst.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/DoRn6YyWsAEYPlK-1030x687.jpeg)\n\nSimontaival is pure offense. He’s one of the top scorers for Tappara and even produced in a small group of games in Finland’s adult-age Mestis league. He may not be the biggest kid on the ice, but Simontaival plays with intensity and is always looking to ram his offensive prowess right down his opponents’ throats. He spends a lot of time hovering near his own line in search of passes to pick off and turn into instant odd-man rushes.\n\nSimontaival has been a threat anywhere he’s played. From a top-six role in the Mestis to a first-line winger at the junior and international level, Simontaival has been able to use his quickness and attack-first mentality to generate multiple chances for himself or his linemates. Creating time and space is rarely a problem for someone with quick feet and advanced puck control like Simontaival, and his anticipation off the hop is quite high. In the last U18 5 Nations tournament, Simontaival played alongside a pair of physical forwards in 2021 draft prospect Samuel Helenius and winger Eetu Liukas, and he was actively engaged in boards battles and fought for pucks before he dished them out for one-timers or chances near the net.\n\nFrom a skating standpoint, Simontaival maintains a slightly hunched posture but can drop a quick first step. Having a low center of gravity might make one think his stride is short or choppy, but Simontaival’s stride is long and clean, and he can outpace pressure even from an equal starting point. He’s nimble and agile in tight spaces, and Simontaival is consistent in his ability to fake or juke an opponent to lean the wrong way and beat them to a spot for a clean look. He has very strong edges, and there are several stylistic comparisons to Chicago Blackhawks prospect Niklas Nordgren.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.67614781Z","tags":null},"/reference/2022-How-LAK-Creates-Offense-Hockey-Tactics-Newsletter":{"title":"","content":"\n# How LAK Creates Offense - by Jack Han\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e The ideas behind the Kings' leap\n\nJack Han\n\nMetadata: \n\n[[2022]]\n[[The Hockey Tactics Newsletter]]\n[Original Link](https://jhanhky.substack.com/p/how-lak-creates-offense?s=r)\n\n---\n# How LAK Creates Offense\n\n### The ideas behind the Kings' leap\n\n\u003ctable class=\"meta-author-wrap with-photo alternative-meta\"\u003e\u003ctbody\u003e\u003ctr class=\"meta-author-wrap-row\"\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"account-hover-wrapper\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"user-head \"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://substack.com/profile/9301555-jack-han\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"profile-img-wrap\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_90,h_90,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e719d6-ebcc-4423-b835-333080ea4499_558x575.jpeg\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd class=\"meta-author-contents\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"meta-right-column\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"meta-author\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"account-hover-wrapper\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://substack.com/profile/9301555-jack-han\"\u003eJack Han\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ctable class=\"post-meta   custom alternative-meta\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"\u003e\u003ctbody\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd class=\"post-meta-item audience-lock\"\u003e\u003csvg role=\"img\" width=\"15.058823529411764\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 17\" fill=\"none\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke=\"#000\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" style=\"height: 16px; width: 15.0588px;\"\u003e\u003cg\u003e\u003ctitle\u003e\u003c/title\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M5 6L5 3.9C5 2.57452 6.11929 1.5 7.5 1.5C8.88071 1.5 10 2.57452 10 3.9V6\" stroke=\"#262626\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M2 7.5C2 6.94772 2.44772 6.5 3 6.5H12C12.5523 6.5 13 6.94772 13 7.5V12.5C13 13.0523 12.5523 13.5 12 13.5H3C2.44771 13.5 2 13.0523 2 12.5V7.5Z\" fill=\"#262626\" stroke=\"#262626\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/g\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd class=\"post-meta-item post-date\" title=\"2022-02-26T14:27:41.545Z\"\u003e\u003ctime datetime=\"2022-02-26T14:27:41.545Z\"\u003eFeb 26\u003c/time\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/tbody\u003e\u003c/table\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003ctable class=\"post-meta  alternative-meta custom\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"\u003e\u003ctbody\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd class=\"post-meta-item icon\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003ca href=\"javascript:void(0)\"\u003e\u003csvg role=\"img\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 22 22\" fill=\"none\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke=\"#000\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"recommend-icon post-meta-icon\" style=\"width: 16px; height: 16px;\"\u003e\u003cg\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eShare\u003c/title\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M11.6247 14.5716C6.00049 14.5716 3.41296 16.7144 1 21.0001C1.00018 11.0001 5.37535 7.42871 11.6247 7.42871\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M11.6662 1L21 11L11.6662 21\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M11.6641 14.5723L11.6641 21.0008\" stroke-linecap=\"round\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M11.6602 1L11.6602 7.42857\" stroke-linecap=\"round\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/g\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/tbody\u003e\u003c/table\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/tbody\u003e\u003c/table\u003e\n\n[\n\n![Twitter avatar for @JhanHky](https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/JhanHky.jpg)Jack Han @JhanHky\n\nLAK is gonna be good this year...](https://twitter.com/JhanHky/status/1441036676885778433?s=20\u0026t=dKyh70tmSmXy1R4TAV3lwg)[\n\nSeptember 23rd 2021\n\n6 Retweets84 Likes\n\n](https://twitter.com/JhanHky/status/1441036676885778433?s=20\u0026t=dKyh70tmSmXy1R4TAV3lwg)\n\nHeading into the 2021-22 NHL season, I was more optimistic than most about the Los Angeles Kings’ playoff chances.\n\nMicah Blake McCurdy’s HockeyViz model had LAK as [a bubble playoff team with mediocre play-driving](https://hockeyviz.com/txt/preview2122).

F3 loiters high in the zone and shades toward the strong side.\n\nThe narrowness of LAK’s 2-1-2 deters against strong-side breakouts.

He dominated his second U16 season, posting 42 goals and 20 assists through just 22 games. He played his first two games of U20 hockey in the 2017-18 season, and went on to continue to impress in the 2018-19 season with the U20 team — he recorded nine goals and 18 assists in 27 games.\n\n![Kasper Simontaival Tappara](https://thehockeywriters.com/ezoimgfmt/s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Kasper-Simontaival-Tappara.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng%3Awebp%2Fngcb57)\n\nKasper Simontaival of Tappara (Arno Hamalainen\\_)\n\nDuring the 2018-19 season, Simontaival also began playing with Tappara of the Liiga, with two assists in five games. In his pre-draft season, he played most of his games with the U20 team, totaling 25 goals and 32 assists in 48 games, but he also got in four games in the Liiga.\n\nAt the 2020 NHL Entry Draft, the Los Angeles Kings [selected Simontaival in the third round](https://thehockeywriters.com/kings-2020-draft-successes/), 66th overall. He followed that up with another season withTappara of the Liiga, scoring three goals and four assists in 30 games. He also [played at the World Junior Championship](https://thehockeywriters.com/kings-prospects-impressing-2021-wjc-preliminaries/) (WJC) for Finland, scoring at a point-per-game pace — four goals and three assists in seven games.\n\nSo far this season, Simontaival has played 18 games with KalPa of the Liiga, recording three goals and five assists.\n\n## Scouting Report\n\nSimontaival is an elite playmaker. His hockey IQ and creativity are rare, and they have carried and will carry him throughout his career. He is a great option to have in a prospect pool, as his ability to make something out of nothing is unique.\n\nSimontaival doesn’t have many downfalls. Some have struggled with his skating, but it is not a big issue by any means, and he is not as stellar defensively — an issue that comes along with his size.\n\n## NHL Projection\n\nWhile it is tough to determine where Simontaival might end up in the Kings’ lineup given their plethora of forward prospects, he could be a top-six player one day. Most of the team’s forward depth lies at center, so there is room for him on the right side. Craig Button has compared Simontaival to [Cam Atkinson](https://thehockeywriters.com/docs/cam-atkinson/). They are both smaller players — Atkinson is 5-foot-8, 176 pounds — who are offensively gifted; in his career thus far, Atkinson has scored 230 goals and 208 assists in 672 games.\n\n![Cam Atkinson, Philadelphia Flyers](https://thehockeywriters.com/ezoimgfmt/s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cam-Atkinson-Flyers-2-1200x900.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb57)\n\nCam Atkinson, Philadelphia Flyers ([Amy Irvin](https://www.facebook.com/38Photography) / The Hockey Writers)\n\nWhile it might be a stretch to say Simontaival will have a similar career, if he continues to develop as he has been and raises his defensive game to an NHL level, he could be a big part of the Kings’ future.\n\n## Quotables\n\n\u003e _Prolific goal-scorer with quick, quality hands…his shot is a legit threat…can also deliver dangerous passes._\n\u003e \n\u003e [Draftin Europe](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/397010/kasper-simontaival)\n\n\u003e He may not be the biggest kid on the ice, but Simontaival plays with intensity and is always looking to ram his offensive prowess right down his opponents’ throats.

Here are five things to watch for this season\n\n ![Photo illustration of Kings players Drew Doughty and Kevin Fiala.](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/82ac6c6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1600+0+0/resize/2400x1600!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0b%2F9d%2Fb404c40a4ec3a83fdba0609e97cc%2Fkings.jpg)\n\n(Photo of Drew Doughty by The Associated Press; Photo of Kevin Fiala by Getty Images; Photo illustration by Tim Hubbard / Los Angeles Times)\n\n1\n\nThe [Kings](https://www.nhl.com/kings) took a big leap forward by reaching the playoffs last season and [taking Edmonton to seven games](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-05-14/kings-season-ends-game-7-loss-edmonton-oilers-nhl-playoffs) despite being depleted by injuries. The next step for them is to win a playoff round or two, and they’re capable of that if a few things go right. They open the season Tuesday against Vegas at Crypto.com Arena.\n\n_Here are five things to watch this season:_\n\n2\n\n### How many points will Kevin Fiala score?\n\n ![Kings forward Kevin Fiala readies for a faceoff during a preseason game against the Ducks on Oct. 2.](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ed2095f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5072x3900+0+0/resize/1200x923!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F27%2F31%2Fcd20f70a41f6bac0de53e58f3707%2F1429838144.jpg)\n\n(Juan Ocampo / NHLI via Getty Images)\n\n[General manager Rob Blake](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2021-05-19/nhl-kings-rob-blake-major-improvement-needed) sent a message when he acquired left wing [Kevin Fiala](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-06-29/kings-acquire-left-wing-kevin-fiala-from-minnesota-wild) and signed him to a seven-year, $55.125-million contract. That told players their progress last season had earned them an upgrade in talent, and that Blake isn’t afraid to spend money for the right fit at the right time.\n\nFiala, center [Anze Kopitar](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-10-03/kings-stanley-cup-contenders-anze-kopitar-phillip-danault-drew-doughty), and right wing [Adrian Kempe](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-07-10/kings-adrian-kempe-agree-4-year-22-million-dollar-extension) could be the balanced, high-scoring first line the Kings have lacked for a long time. Fiala, 26, is coming off career-best totals in goals (33) and points (85), and his skills should mesh well with pass-first Kopitar.\n\nFiala also will get a lot of power-play time, which could pad his totals. If he stays in the range of 80 to 85 points and Kempe can prove his career-best 35 goals and 54 points last season weren’t a fluke, that trio could be dangerous.\n\n3\n\n### Can a healthy Drew Doughty regain his Cup-era form?\n\n ![Kings defenseman Drew Doughty follows the puck during a game against the Ducks on Feb. 25.](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/14faf48/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5297x2980+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F72%2F8a%2F40f8d2d74d3eaa9c285613fbf48a%2Fkings-ducks-hockey-18468.jpg)\n\n(Jae C. Hong / Associated Press)\n\nA deep, mobile defense is a must to succeed in the playoffs. [Drew Doughty](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-02-16/kings-ceremony-for-drew-doughty-loss-to-oilers), who recovered from wrist surgery that ended his season early, seems invigorated by the progress the Kings made last season. At 32, he should have a few elite-level seasons left.\n\nDoughty and Mikey Anderson are a solid pair. Sean Walker’s return from knee surgery also will provide a lift. This could be a big season for Sean Durzi, who showed intriguing flashes of creativity last season.\n\n4\n\n### Which kids will step up?\n\n ![Kings center Quinton Byfield, left, battles for the puck against San Jose Sharks defenseman Markus Nutivaara.](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a24f123/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6452x4301+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1d%2Fd1%2F22e1fedf4c18a9f2ced99e2c0a28%2Fkings-sharks-hockey-09899.jpg)\n\nKings center Quinton Byfield, left, battles for the puck against San Jose Sharks defenseman Markus Nutivaara during a preseason game Sept. 25.\n\n(Tony Avelar / Associated Press)\n\nAll eyes will be on Quinton Byfield, who was expected to play a key role last season but broke his ankle before the season and later was placed on the COVID-19 protocol list while preparing to return.\n\nThe No. 2 overall pick in 2020 produced five goals and 10 points in 40 games, despite his obvious skills and size (6-foot-5, 220 pounds), and he was scratched after the first two games of the Kings’ playoff series against Edmonton. He must turn his occasional brilliance into consistent and responsible play as the third-line center behind Kopitar and [Phillip Danault](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2021-08-11/kings-phillip-danault-new-home).\n\nGabe Vilardi, whose progress has been slowed by injuries since he was drafted No. 11 in 2017, was impressive during training camp. He filled in well while Viktor Arvidsson (20 goals in 66 games last season) recovered from back surgery. Arvidsson’s quicker-than-expected return puts Vilardi on the third line with Byfield and Alex Iafallo, a golden chance for all three to prove themselves.\n\nWinger Arthur Kaliyev, 21, scored six of his 14 goals on the power play and can add punch to the second unit. Defenseman Tobias Bjornfot, 21, has struggled to keep a spot and that’s unlikely to change.\n\n5\n\n### Will goaltending be a problem?\n\n ![Kings goaltender Jonathan Quick watches a shot fly past the goal during a playoff game against the Edmonton Oilers in May.](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/86135f6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2790x1859+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F04%2Fe0%2F76a24fe04ea0bca0e316a0cab6d4%2Foilers-kings-hockey-60281.jpg)\n\n(Mark J. Terrill / Associated Press)\n\nCoach Todd McLellan’s choice of Cal Petersen to start the opener last season seemed to signal an end to the Jonathan Quick-led Cup champions’ era and the rise of the next generation. That was the plan, but Petersen dropped the torch and Quick (.910 save percentage, 2.59 goals-against average) regained his old form.\n\nQuick is as competitive as ever, but he’s approaching 37 and the Kings need to find a reliable partner to share the load. Petersen will get every chance at the job but can’t blow it again. If he falters, Blake might have to make a move.\n\n6\n\n### Can they improve their power play?\n\n ![Kings center Gabriel Vilardi celebrates with teammates after scoring during a preseason game against the Ducks on Oct. 4.](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/148dbde/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5213x3475+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fea%2F19%2F906250994f5399fdf9ccb291f03d%2Fkings-ducks-hockey-86351.jpg)\n\n(Ashley Landis / Associated Press)\n\nEven a small improvement could generate a big boost after the Kings ranked 27th last season with a 16.1% success rate. A failing power play not only wastes chances but drags down the rest of the offense.\n\nNewly hired assistant coach Jim Hiller, who played about half a season with the Kings during his brief NHL career, is in charge of the power play, which could include using Fiala at the point on the first unit.\n\nThe penalty-killing unit (76.7% efficiency, 22nd in the NHL) also needs major improvement.\n\nGet the latest on L.A.'s teams in the daily Sports Report newsletter.\n\nYou may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times.\n\n[![](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7a5578f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1125x1125+438+0/resize/100x100!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fba%2F21%2F8771bf6c69fecba403ad486e1659%2Fimg-5d1bb3e6-turbine-la-xard34z494df-20190702)](https://www.latimes.com/people/helene-elliott)\n\nHelene Elliott joined the Los Angeles Times’ sports department in 1989.

Just really wish he had gone through this season last year and was further along this season and then next year was maybe the big step year. Just doesn't seem like he gained anything by being in the AHL last year, which is frustrating. I thought maybe last year in the AHL would have made him further a long than he has shown.

Byfield has a total of 14 minutes on the power play for his whole career. Byfield's averaging fourth line minutes. Expecting much more than fourth line production is lunacy. He's essentially playing the same number of minutes as guys like Kyle Clifford, Jordan Nolan, and Andy Andreoff in years past.  \n    \u003e   \n    \u003e Hell, in Kempe's rookie season, he scored two goals and six points in 25 games playing 12:00 per game, and two of Kempe's four assists came on the power play. I don't particularly care where Byfield is today as long as he continues to grow and learn, but I will care where he is in a couple years.\n    \n    [kilowatt](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlmembers/kilowatt.78826/), [Thursday at 4:38 PM](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlposts/183262805/ \"Permalink\") [Report](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlposts/183262805/report) [Bookmark](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlposts/183262805/bookmark)\n    \n    [682](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlthreads/quinton-byfield-2nd-overall-2020-draft-discussion-part-ii.2817801/page-28#post-183262805 \"Permalink\") [Like](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlposts/183262805/like) [\\+ Multi-Quote](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlthreads/quinton-byfield-2nd-overall-2020-draft-discussion-part-ii.2817801/reply?quote=183262805 \"Toggle Multi-Quote\") [Reply](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlthreads/quinton-byfield-2nd-overall-2020-draft-discussion-part-ii.2817801/reply?quote=183262805 \"Reply, quoting this message\")\n    \n    [kingsfan](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlmembers/kingsfan.1680/) and [Schmooley](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlmembers/schmooley.269449/) like this.\n    \n-   [![Peter James Bond II](https://cdn1-hfboards.mandatory.com/data/avatars/l/247/247251.jpg?1637385697)](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlmembers/peter-james-bond-ii.247251/)\n    \n    ### \n    \n    [Peter James Bond II](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlmembers/peter-james-bond-ii.247251/)\n    \n    _Chromiak Cometh_\n    \n    Joined:\n    \n    Mar 5, 2015\n    \n    Messages:\n    \n    [2,823](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlsearch/member?user_id=247251)\n    \n    Likes Received:\n    \n    3,518\n    \n    Trophy Points:\n    \n    [126](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlmembers/peter-james-bond-ii.247251/trophies)\n    \n    SB Cash:\n    \n    $ 100,000\n    \n    **New**\n    \n    \u003e There is a lot of pressure, being 19 and centering a line; especially a team fighting for a playoff spot....and getting the 2 worst wingers as well each game. It's not putting him in  \n    \u003e a position to succeed.  \n    \u003e   \n    \u003e I'd honestly love to see him play LW 1 or LW 2 the rest of the year. I think by next year, he will have that much more experience and another Summer of training...probably  \n    \u003e have another 7-8 pounds of muscle and ready to take 3C and succeed. By having the best talent to play with and be on LW, he can play his game and get some PP time as  \n    \u003e well. I do not think he would fail. I think because the Kings are fighting for a playoff spot, Todd won't let this happen, unfortunately....will say crap like \"Quinton needs  \n    \u003e to give himself permission to play well and succeed' or some such trash. Give Kopi 9 minutes with Brown and whomever and zero PP time and watch him fail.  \n    \u003e   \n    \u003e At least AI is on line 3 and hopefully that helps. I think with Todd, you need to earn trust of everyone, to play top 6....Arty has really propelled himself and done that.  \n    \u003e But, he may be on a short leash. We'll see. I don't think ALL players that should get top 6 minutes, may never get that approval mark...or hit that threshold Todd  \n    \u003e wants / demands. It is a good thing to excel and earn it, like Moore has...but talented offensive players need to play in the top 6. I think Lias has the talent to,  \n    \u003e but may not get that chance, here. I know he's had some bleh games, but know he has the talent. If he plays bottom 6 and does not get any PP time, will be a shame.  \n    \u003e He's top 3 in the entire organization, 5 feet from the net. Won't get many chances there in the bottom 6. He and Grundstrom are the first to get scratched, no matter  \n    \u003e how hard they play, or the results.  \n    \u003e   \n    \u003e QB will be fine. He's skating well, getting off some good shots, making good plays...like the spin and sharp pass to Grundstrom, for that goal. Thank God  \n    \u003e Carl goes to the net like that, or that play never happens....as Brown does not go to the net like that, anymore. But, he's out there, to protect QB,  \n    \u003e as Rob said. ?\n    \n    [Peter James Bond II](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlmembers/peter-james-bond-ii.247251/), [Thursday at 6:02 PM](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlposts/183267772/ \"Permalink\") [Report](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlposts/183267772/report) [Bookmark](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlposts/183267772/bookmark)\n    \n    [683](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlthreads/quinton-byfield-2nd-overall-2020-draft-discussion-part-ii.2817801/page-28#post-183267772 \"Permalink\") [Unlike](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlposts/183267772/like) [\\+ Multi-Quote](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlthreads/quinton-byfield-2nd-overall-2020-draft-discussion-part-ii.2817801/reply?quote=183267772 \"Toggle Multi-Quote\") [Reply](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlthreads/quinton-byfield-2nd-overall-2020-draft-discussion-part-ii.2817801/reply?quote=183267772 \"Reply, quoting this message\")\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.67614781Z","tags":null},"/reference/Kings-Arvidsson-Finds-a-Home-on-the-Second-Line":{"title":"","content":"\n# Kings' Arvidsson Finds a Home on the Second Line\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e Los Angeles Kings forward Viktor Arvidsson has found his feet in Los Angeles, especially after his move onto the second line.\n\nAustin Stanovich\n\nMetadata: \n\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](https://thehockeywriters.com/kings-arvidsson-finds-home-second-line/)\n\n---\n# Kings’ Arvidsson Finds a Home on the Second Line\n\nFebruary 9, 2022 by [Austin Stanovich](https://thehockeywriters.com/author/astanovich/ \"View all posts by Austin Stanovich\")\n\n-   [](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthehockeywriters.com%2Fkings-arvidsson-finds-home-second-line%2F \"Share this post!\")\n-   [](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthehockeywriters.com%2Fkings-arvidsson-finds-home-second-line%2F\u0026text=Last summer, Los Angeles Kings general manager Rob Blake made a series of moves intended to take the team from rebuilding bottom-feeders to playoff hopefuls.

The first of those moves was trading a 2021 second-round pick and a 2022 third-round pick to the Nashville Predators [in exchange for Viktor Arvidsson.](https://www.nhl.com/news/viktor-arvidsson-nashville-los-angeles-trade/c-325543696) The initial plan was for Arvidsson to come in and be the goal-scoring winger [Anze Kopitar](https://thehockeywriters.com/docs/anze-kopitar/) has been missing for the last few seasons. Unfortunately, that didn’t happen, but Arvidsson has still found success with the team and is now one of their best offensive weapons.\n\n## Arvidsson on the First Line\n\nAt the beginning of this season, Arvidsson played with Kopitar on the first line, with Dustin Brown and Adrian Kempe rotating out as his wing partners. The initial line of Arvidsson-Kopitar-Brown was okay — it posted solid possession numbers and marginally outscored opponents. Conceptually, the line made sense; Brown would provide physicality and puck retrieval, Arvidsson could provide speed and finishing, while Kopitar was the dominant, two-way playmaker he’s always been. Unfortunately, Arvidsson struggled to finish, couldn’t find chemistry with Kopitar, and Brown was clearly not a first-line player anymore. The line wasn’t a liability by any means, but they were not good enough for a first line. if(typeof \\_\\_ez\\_fad\\_position!='undefined'){\\_\\_ez\\_fad\\_position('div-gpt-ad-thehockeywriters\\_com-medrectangle-3-0')};\n\n![Viktor Arvidsson Los Angeles Kings](https://thehockeywriters.com/ezoimgfmt/s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Viktor-Arvidsson-Kings-2.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng%3Awebp%2Fngcb57)\n\nViktor Arvidsson, Los Angeles Kings ([Jess Starr](https://www.instagram.com/jmstarr_/)/The Hockey Writers)\n\nThe team didn’t give up on Arvidsson on the top line right away, though. They swapped Brown out for Kempe, hoping the two Swedes could find chemistry and jump-start the line. It was successful in that it improved the line’s possession numbers, but the line struggled to score, and couldn’t keep pucks out of their own net. The line would only score once and would concede five before coach Todd McLellan decided to shake things up.\n\n**Related: [Kings Begin Summer Shopping With Arvidsson Trade](https://thehockeywriters.com/kings-arvidsson-trade-positives/)**\n\nHindsight being 20/20, Kempe and Arvidsson were always a poor fit as wing partners. Both players look to generate offense in a similar fashion, using their speed to back defenders off while producing a very high shot volume. The line’s combination of size, speed, and skill allowed them to dominate possession numbers and even produce better chances than their opponents, but they were ultimately one-dimensional and couldn’t consistently produce real offense. if(typeof \\_\\_ez\\_fad\\_position!='undefined'){\\_\\_ez\\_fad\\_position('div-gpt-ad-thehockeywriters\\_com-box-4-0')};\n\n## if(typeof \\_\\_ez\\_fad\\_position!='undefined'){\\_\\_ez\\_fad\\_position('div-gpt-ad-thehockeywriters\\_com-medrectangle-4-0')};Arvidsson on the Second Line\n\nA great safety net for players who are struggling on the Kings this season has been putting them with Phillip Danault, as the second-line center has seemingly improved every winger who has been placed with him. [Arvidsson has been no different](https://mayorsmanor.com/2021/11/projected-lineup-la-kings-vs-ottawa-senators-in-game-20/), finding success with both Alex Iafallo and Trevor Moore playing opposite of him. The Moore-Danault-Arvidsson line has been particularly impressive, with one of the best goal percentages in the NHL, outscoring opponents 12-2. They’ve also been dominant in possession, controlling over 60 percent of both shot attempts and shots on net. The newly crowned “Nice Line” was pivotal in a great month of January where the team went 8-4-2, and Arvidsson is a key member of their success.\n\n![Viktor Arvidsson Los Angeles Kings](https://thehockeywriters.com/ezoimgfmt/s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Viktor-Arvidsson-Kings-1200x800.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb57)\n\nViktor Arvidsson, Los Angeles Kings ([Jess Starr](https://www.instagram.com/jmstarr_/)/The Hockey Writers)\n\nA very hard worker, much like Danault and Moore, Arvidsson injects a dose of skill and speed into the line. A good presence on the forecheck, a high-volume shooter, and one of the league’s best at creating off the rush, he complements his two linemates perfectly. Danault is a play driver who dominates in the corners and along the wall, while [Moore is a Swiss Army knife](https://hockeyroyalty.com/2022/01/20/la-kings-the-emergence-of-trevor-moore-and-why-its-good-for-hockey-in-california/) who can perform any role asked of him.\n\nIt’s on the rush where Arvidsson does the most damage — according to AllThreeZones.com, only Johnny Gaudreau has generated more offense off the rush than Arvidsson this season. According to the same website, he’s also generating the most shots per 60 minutes, with a staggering 22.81 shots per 60. His finishing let him down massively at the beginning of the season, scoring just twice in his first 10 games, and just six times in his first 25 games. He’s starting to find his scoring touch, though, with seven goals in his last 14 games; we’re beginning to see shades of the two-time 30-goal scorer he once was.\n\nWhile it’s very unlikely he’s able to break the 30-goal mark again this season, especially considering he’s missed seven games already, I do expect him to continue this upward trajectory. His play earlier in the season deserved more goals and he’s now being rewarded for solid play. It will be interesting to see how long the Moore-Danault-Arvidsson line can keep up this level of dominance, but I think regardless of what happens with that line we can expect this version of Arvidsson to stay, if not improve.if(typeof \\_\\_ez\\_fad\\_position!='undefined'){\\_\\_ez\\_fad\\_position('div-gpt-ad-thehockeywriters\\_com-banner-1-0')};\n\n## A Smart Acquisition\n\nThe [NHL expansion draft last](https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/31858223/seattle-kraken-expansion-draft-live-results-players-selected-30-nhl-teams) summer created a unique opportunity for Blake to go out and grab a player for much cheaper than they should have been, and he capitalized. Under normal circumstances, a player with Arvidsson’s pedigree and underlying numbers, which showed a bounce-back was inevitable, would never have been traded for so little. He’s already surpassed his point total from last season and is only getting better as the season progresses. This was always a perfect low-risk, high-reward move for the Kings, and they’re very close to cashing in on the high-reward portion of the deal.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.67614781Z","tags":null},"/reference/Kings-Select-Kasper-Simontaival-Round-3-Pick-66-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"","content":"\n# Kings Select Kasper Simontaival (Round 3, Pick 66) - LA Kings Insider\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e The LA Kings have selected forward Kasper Simontaival with the 66th overall pick in the 2020 NHL Draft!

But he remains a very quality player with a lot of intriguing offensive attributes. He’s got a very quick stick and can beat defenders with his skill. I wouldn’t call him a top playmaker, but he can find the seams on the ice well and flash high-end vision. His shot is more impressive to me than his passing, although I think both are certainly strong points. The main areas of concern for Simontaival are his small frame and just fine skating. I think his edgework is good and he’s shifty in small spaces, but he lacks any real speed and his stride breaks down more than you’d like for a small forward. He does compete well and is good around the net, but he isn’t that strong in puck battles or defensively.\n\n**[Via ESPN’s Chris Peters](https://www.espn.com/nhl/insider/story/_/id/29994322/2020-nhl-draft-rankings-final-top-100-prospects-class-chris-peters-plus-position-rankings)**  \nHe’s small but quick with excellent hands and a desire to create. Simontaival put up big numbers in Finland’s top junior league this season but couldn’t quite find his game against pros. There’s a lot of room for him to improve certain elements of his game, but I think his speed helps lessen any size worries.\n\n**[Elite Prospects 2020 Draft Guide](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/397010/kasper-simontaival)**  \nHe’s a true dual-threat winger with two-way upside, a sturdy frame, and the type of competitiveness necessary to hang in there as a vertically-challenged forward. The 5-foot-9 winger has a lethal release that can beat goalies from tough angles and long distances. He wields the best shot out of Finland in this year’s draft.\n\n![](https://lakingsinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MicrosoftTeams-image-640x427.jpg \"MicrosoftTeams-image\")\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.67614781Z","tags":null},"/reference/Kings-open-season-with-heartbreaking-loss-to-Golden-Knights-Los-Angeles-Times":{"title":"","content":"\n# Kings open season with heartbreaking loss to Golden Knights - Los Angeles Times\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e For the first time in years, the Kings are out of their rebuild stage as they look to chisel a clear path to becoming Stanley Cup contenders.\n\nHelene Elliott\n\n---\nWhen [Todd McLellan](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2020-12-11/todd-mclellan-expecting-the-unexpected-in-his-second-season-with-kings) was hired to coach the downtrodden [Kings](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey) in 2019, he compared them to marathon runners at Mile 1. With a hard-fought playoff series loss behind him and the deepest, most skillful lineup he has had at his disposal, McLellan updated that analogy as he began his fourth season.\n\n“We’ve settled into the race now,” he said. “We’ve climbed some hills. We got in some valleys. I think in marathons there’s runners that break away and sometimes the pack catches them again. I would say we’re in that pack. We’re no longer in Miles 1 through 5. We’re way further into it.\n\n“But if crossing the finish line and putting a medal around your neck is the Stanley Cup championship, we still have a lot of running to do.”\n\nTrue. But they’re striding purposefully now, not stumbling. They have structure, defined lines and a mobile defense corps that’s injury-free.\n\n“We wasted an outstanding goaltending effort by not getting a point tonight,” McLellan said of goaltender Jonathan Quick’s effort against a 51-shot barrage.\n\nStill, looking at the big picture, they’re no longer running on a treadmill to failure. Their path is clear. They just have to avoid hitting the wall.\n\n“We made a step last year but now we have to make sure we’re taking the ability to move past that and keep that going,” general manager Rob Blake said Monday in discussing the season. “I think there’s less and less concerns through our lineup. I think there still are at different times and there will be at times as the season goes on, but I do think we have players that can fill some certain roles and we do have some depth in the right positions if needed.”\n\nThe impact of acquiring and signing [left wing Kevin Fiala](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-06-29/kings-acquire-left-wing-kevin-fiala-from-minnesota-wild) to a seven-year, $55.125-million contract extends beyond hoping he will replicate the career-best 33 goals and 85 points he scored for Minnesota last season and join [Kempe](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-07-10/kings-adrian-kempe-agree-4-year-22-million-dollar-extension) and [center Anze Kopitar](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2021-05-06/column-1-000-point-milestone-reaffirms-kopitar-as-one-of-l-a-s-most-accomplished-athletes) to form an elite first line.\n\n“I think Rob has made some really good moves and it just shows us that he believes in us and he spent that money for a really good player that we needed,” said [center Phillip Danault](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2021-08-11/kings-phillip-danault-new-home), who added an offensive dimension to his trademark solid defense during his first season with the Kings. “Rob did a big move, and now it’s our time to show it on the ice.”\n\n ![Vegas' Jack Eichel, right, shoots under pressure from Kings' Phillip Danault, foreground, and Viktor Arvidsson.](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/abea0c6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4959x3306+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F14%2F38%2F8f7fc87b4aebbffd953b028376ad%2Fgolden-knights-kings-hockey-15940.jpg)\n\nVegas Golden Knights’ Jack Eichel, right, shoots under pressure from Kings’ Phillip Danault, foreground, and Viktor Arvidsson during the first period on Tuesday at Crpyto.com Arena.\n\n(Jae C. Hong / Associated Press)\n\nWhether Danault can match the 27 goals and 51 points he scored last season alongside Thousand Oaks native Trevor Moore and Viktor Arvidsson is one of the “ifs” that will go a long way toward determining the Kings’ fate. The same is true for Kempe’s career-high 35 goals and 54 points.\n\nIf those were flukes, scoring will continue to be a problem. If Danault and Kempe can match or surpass those totals, there will be less pressure on their kids to produce, though 2020 No.2 pick Quinton Byfield and 2017 No.11 pick Vilardi — on the third line with Alex Iafallo — must contribute.\n\n“Yes, I can do it again,” Danault said. “I can’t wait to see what this year is going to bring, and obviously I’m waiting for what I’ve wanted to achieve my whole life — winning the Cup.”\n\nDanault’s offensive output last season was a bonus. “We definitely have an expectation of Phil that now increases offensively, but I think a lot of it surrounds around his leadership. I felt that he added a big touch to that,” Blake said. “That created excitement some of those players bought in. And now we have to get that out of Kevin Fiala, we have to get it out of some of our young guys who are going to take a little bit more prominent roles on the team.”\n\nMcLellan said he’d seen no signs of Kempe faltering. “Is he a 35-goal scorer? I sure hope so,” McLellan said. “But I know he’s a 20-minute player for sure most nights, and that’s just as important as being a 35-goal scorer.”\n\nUm, sure. But another big season from Kempe is essential, even if new assistant coach Jim Hiller pulls off a miracle and fixes their feeble power play. “When you get into tight situations or an overtime situation and you’re relying on a big player to step up, he’s now at that level for us,” Blake said of Kempe.\n\nThe only change on defense to start the season, other than Drew Doughty and Sean Walker returning from injuries, was the presence on the roster of 19-year-old Brandt Clarke, the eighth pick in the 2021 draft. Clarke didn’t play Tuesday but he might not wait long because McLellan wants to limit the burden on defenseman Sean Durzi, who is coming off shoulder surgery.\n\nGoaltending is their biggest “maybe.” Quick started Tuesday and Cal Petersen backed him up; Petersen started the opener last season but struggled and lost the job. Petersen was shaky in training camp and if he doesn’t find his footing soon, Blake might have to look elsewhere to support Quick, 36.\n\nIn the meantime, the Kings’ marathon continues. They won’t win the race this season, but the finish line isn’t so impossibly far away anymore.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.67614781Z","tags":null},"/reference/Kings-prep-for-Rooke-Faceoff-with-Quinton-Byfield-but-without-Alex-Turcotte":{"title":"","content":"\n# Kings prep for Rookie Faceoff with Quinton Byfield, but without Alex Turcotte – Daily News\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e The Kings believe Byfield, 20, still has “a lot of room left to play harder,” but Turcotte, 21, has yet to be cleared to practice and will not travel for the six-team event in San Jose this weekend…\n\nAndrew Knoll\n\nMetadata: \n\n2022-09-15\n[[Los Angeles Daily News]]\n[Original Link](https://www.dailynews.com/2022/09/15/kings-prep-for-rookie-faceoff-with-quinton-byfield-but-without-alex-turcotte/)\n\n---\n-   ![Jordan Spence was among the Kings players practicing at Toyota...](https://www.dailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/LDN-L-KINGS-0916-9.jpg?w=620)\n    \n    Jordan Spence was among the Kings players practicing at Toyota Sports Performance Center in El Segundo on Thursday ahead of the six-team Rookie Faceoff tournament this weekend in San Jose.

(Photo by Chuck Bennett, Contributing Photographer)\n\n\nEL SEGUNDO –– As the Kings prepared for a three-game sojourn in San Jose for the [2022 Rookie Faceoff tournament](https://www.sjbarracuda.com/tickets/rookie-face-off-2022), there was at least one somewhat surprising presence and one discouraging absence on the practice ice.\n\nCenter Quinton Byfield was in the mix once again, despite the 2020 second overall draft pick’s participation in nearly half the Kings’ games last season. He was the most NHL-experienced player on the ice, and the most prominent along with Brandt Clarke, whom the Kings selected eighth overall last year.\n\n“I think there’s a lot of room left to play harder, because of (Byfield’s) size and strength, he just doesn’t know it yet,” said Ontario Reign coach Marco Sturm, who ran the practice and coached Byfield with the Kings last season. “He will figure it out. It takes time and experience, but this year he should do it more than he did in the past, and I think he will.”\n\nSturm added that Byfield, 20, “looked like a man” among his less experienced and mostly more fresh-faced peers.\n\nThe remaining top-10 pick in the Kings’ prospect pool, 21-year-old center Alex Turcotte (No. 5 overall in 2019) was nowhere to be found, despite having been listed on the initial list of camp participants. Turcotte sustained two concussions last season, curbing his development and overshadowing his eight-game stint with the big club.\n\nSturm offered little in the way of a detailed update on Turcotte, saying only that his spirits were high but that the doctors were still evaluating his condition before giving an all-clear. Turcotte will not travel to San Jose for games against Colorado on Friday, Vegas on Saturday and San Jose on Monday.\n\n“As of right now, he’s not cleared, that’s all that I know,” Sturm said. “We want him healthy. He’s been through a lot in the past so we want to take our time and when the doctor says he’s ready to go, then he is.”\n\nThough two concussions, one during the regular season and one during the postseason, might be daunting to surmount, Turcotte isn’t the only Kings prospect to overcome injuries during his development period.\n\nForwards Rasmus Kupari and Gabe Vilardi, a pair of former first-rounders, were on the ice working with other veterans and goalie coach Bill Ranford on Thursday. But both had spent substantial time on the sidelines earlier in their careers. Kupari sustained a severe knee injury while competing for the Finnish junior national team and Vilardi went through a lengthy process to recover from back surgery and related complications early in his career.\n\nCenter Akil Thomas, who was on the ice with the rookie tournament group on Thursday, also confronted serious injury, most notably a double shoulder surgery ahead of last season. Thomas admitted that missing training camp and the first two months of the season presented mental and physical challenges. He shook them off, however, to finish with 11 points in his final 14 games last season and four goals in four playoff matches.\n\nThomas, whom Sturm said he expected to assume a leadership role in Ontario if he doesn’t make the Kings’ roster, said that he anticipated a similar path back to action for Turcotte.\n\n“Hopefully it’s just a bump in the road. Everyone deals with injuries and whatnot. Obviously, his is taking a little longer than expected, but I’m sure he’ll be good to go sooner than later,” Thomas said. “He’ll take some time to find himself again, but I’m sure he will.”\n\nSturm said it was too early to tell if Turcotte would be available for the Kings’ training camp later this month.\n\nOne player who was already looking forward to training camp was Clarke, who lauded the caliber of opponents the Kings would face in San Jose and said he was seeking to make a strong impression in September in order to join the team full-time in October.\n\n“My goal is to play on this team this year, be a contributor on this team this year, and in the next couple weeks I’m going to try and do the best I can to show that I can hang with these guys,” Clarke said.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.67614781Z","tags":null},"/reference/Stanley-Cup-Contender-Checklist-Analyzing-the-rosters-from-the-last-decade-of-champions":{"title":"","content":"\n# Cup Checklist: Analyzing the rosters from the last decade of champions - The Athletic\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e There are lessons to be learned from past winners; guidelines for how a team’s roster should be made up.\n\nDom Luszczyszyn\n\nMetadata: \nBoston Bruins,Chicago Blackhawks,Los Angeles Kings,Pittsburgh Penguins,St. Louis Blues,Washington Capitals,NHL\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](https://theathletic.com/2077279/2020/09/21/cup-checklist-analyzing-the-rosters-from-the-last-decade-of-champions/)\n\n---\nThere’s no exact formula for winning the Stanley Cup. The [Lightning](https://theathletic.com/team/lightning/) have been a popular pick to win it all for years, but it took them five years since their last Stanley Cup Final berth to make it back. Few would have picked the [Stars](https://theathletic.com/team/stars/) this season, especially with their starting goaltender injured, but they found a way and now they’re three wins away from being champions.\n\nBuilding a roster to win it all isn’t easy, and even building a good team often isn’t enough in a sport with as much chaotic energy as hockey. But there are lessons to be learned from past winners; guidelines for how a team’s roster should be made up. Stylistically they all differ, but from a total value perspective, there are similar elements that can be looked upon as goals for roster-building. The last two Cup winners were led by an elite centre worth roughly three wins, but there’s a big difference between the way Ryan O’Reilly and [Nicklas Backstrom](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/capitals/nicklas-backstrom/) play, for example.\n\nAn elite top line centre being a prerequisite to winning the Stanley Cup shouldn’t come as a huge surprise; it’s a talking point that’s been championed for a long time. Over the past decade only one team, the 2011 [Bruins](https://theathletic.com/team/bruins/), won the Stanley Cup without a projected top line centre. [David Krejci](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/bruins/david-krejci/) was just on the cusp and [Patrice Bergeron](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/bruins/patrice-bergeron/) hadn’t hit his full stride yet as one of the game’s best two-way players. However, both played at that level come playoff time. \n\nOn average, the top centre on a Stanley Cup winning team is worth around 3.8 wins in the regular season; that’s by far the most important piece for a contender. But there’s more to the puzzle than just one player.\n\nThis isn’t a new study by any means, it’s one I did for [The Hockey News](https://www.si.com/hockey/news/eight-simple-rules-for-building-a-stanley-cup-contender) four years ago and one that Cam Lawrence – who works for the [Florida Panthers](https://theathletic.com/team/fla-panthers/) – [also did](https://canucksarmy.com/2015/08/21/building-a-contender-part-5-conclusion/), but it’s worth diving into it again with more data. This time around, I’m armed with projected values for each player at the time of the playoffs to better assess their true talent level, plus a couple extra seasons of results. I’ll also be looking at each position on the depth chart, not just the core players, to give a better idea of where certain players should fit on a Cup-contending roster.\n\nIt’s not just the average that matters, though. It would be foolish to treat 3.8 wins for a top line centre as a “you must be this tall to ride” measuring stick – it’s a range. No team is ever average or above relative to a Cup winner at every position on the roster and having a range of acceptable values helps illustrate where a player falls and how far off a team is. It’s even OK to be below average in a few areas. The key is to make up ground elsewhere and build a roster with as few concessions as possible.\n\nIt should be noted as well that rather than averaging out by left and right wingers or defencemen, the best wingers or defencemen on a given line or pair were grouped together. While most Cup winners are predominantly stronger on the right side, that distinction probably doesn’t matter and this properly groups [Alex Ovechkin](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/capitals/alex-ovechkin/) with [Patrick Kane](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/blackhawks/patrick-kane/) and [John Carlson](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/capitals/john-carlson/) with [Duncan Keith](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/oilers/duncan-keith/), rather than with [Brandon Saad](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/blues/brandon-saad/) and [Michal Kempny](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/capitals/michal-kempny/), respectively. \n\nHere’s how the roster for a Stanley Cup winner looks, with an acceptable range of one standard deviation on either side.\n\n[![](https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2020/09/18144149/Screen-Shot-2020-09-18-at-2.42.23-PM.png)](https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2020/09/18144149/Screen-Shot-2020-09-18-at-2.42.23-PM.png)\n\nBased on the above chart, a team that fancies itself a contender is looking at the following checklist in terms of top of the lineup players.\n\n-   Elite first-line centre that’s among the very best players in the world.\n-   Elite first-line winger to support the elite centre.\n-   Two other top-line wingers on each of the top two lines.\n-   Top-line centre to play behind the elite centre. \n-   Two more top-six forwards for depth in the middle six.\n-   Elite No. 1 defenceman.\n-   A second No. 1 defenceman to play behind him. \n-   A top pairing defenceman to help anchor a strong second pair with the No. 2. \n-   Another top-pairing calibre defender to crush soft minutes on the third pair. \n-   A top 10 calibre starting goaltender.\n\nAnd that’s without mentioning two capable third-liners, another steady top four defenceman who can play on the top pair, and making sure no one on the fourth line or bottom pair is replacement level. It’s a tall order, especially making sure all the pieces fit together beyond numbers on a page. Chemistry matters.\n\nSo while that’s a handy checklist under ideal circumstances, there’s no hard-and-fast rule. That’s where the ranges come in. A team can get away with not meeting the criteria in one area if they surpass it elsewhere and certain areas are more negotiable than others. Only the elite center (9/10), elite defenceman (officially 8/10, but one of the misses is because Keith had an off year), and top pairing defenceman on the second pair (9/10) were found on 80 percent of the champions. Every other archetype on the checklist was there six out of 10 times.\n\nA top 10 goalie would be great, but as long as he’s an above average starter it’s probably fine, especially with a strong defence in front of him. Having an elite winger on the top line is ideal, but a team can probably get away with someone that’s a shade below if they have strong depth in the middle six. \n\nThere’s other lessons that can be gleaned from this too, and those are the areas that are probably _not_ worth sweating over. Three areas come to mind: third-line center, top pair next to the star and the fourth line.\n\nDepth down the middle is crucial to building a Cup contender, but on average 86 percent of the value is confined to the top two centres. The past 10 Cup winners have been built off strong duos (O’Reilly/Schenn, Backstrom/Kuznetsov, Crosby/Malkin, Kopitar/Carter, Krejci/Bergeron). Meanwhile, only [Tyler Bozak](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/blues/tyler-bozak/), [Nick Bonino](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/sharks/nick-bonino/) and [Mike Richards](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/capitals/mike-richards/) were considered to be centres above third-line calibre. The same goes for the wingers. Only 14 out of 30 third-liners were top six calibre.\n\nThere’s also the idea that a team’s cornerstone defenceman needs to play with another top pairing guy to maximize the top pair. But the beauty of most elite defencemen is they generally don’t need much help. We’re seeing that play out this year with [Victor Hedman](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/lightning/victor-hedman/) lugging around [Zach Bogosian](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/lightning/zach-bogosian/) or [Luke Schenn](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/canucks/luke-schenn/), but there’s some historical precedent to it. Sure there’s Keith with [Brent Seabrook](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/lightning/brent-seabrook/), but there’s also been [Zdeno Chara](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/islanders/zdeno-chara/) with [Dennis Seidenberg](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/islanders/dennis-seidenberg/), [Drew Doughty](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/kings/drew-doughty/) with [Willie Mitchell](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/fla-panthers/willie-mitchell/), John Carlson with Michal Kempny and [Alex Pietrangelo](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/golden-knights/alex-pietrangelo/) with [Joel Edmundson](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/canadiens/joel-edmundson/). Good, steady players that coaches can trust in tough minutes – but they’re players that really aren’t that difficult to find.\n\nLastly, the average fourth line for a Cup contender looks like … an average fourth line. There’s nothing special here aside from a few years of [Matt Cullen](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/penguins/matt-cullen/) being awesome. If there’s a place to cut corners on a roster it’s here, especially since teams can ramp up the ice time of the top six in the playoffs.\n\nBut there’s an even more important reason the fourth lines don’t matter nearly as much here, and it’s because of the other part of this average Cup contender equation: how the players actually perform in the playoffs. That detail is often underreported on the analytics side when it comes to investigating a player’s total value, but it’s an important one – especially in comparison to how those players are projected to perform.\n\nWhen the average first-line Cup-winning centre is projected to be worth 3.8 wins, that’s under the expectation of playing against an average team under average circumstances. But the playoffs are not that. They’re a gruelling grind against increasingly difficult competition where matchups become even more important in a seven-game series.\n\nSo top line centres on Cup winners don’t provide as much value as projected. In fact, they have the largest drop-off of any position on the depth chart, losing 0.9 wins of value. That’s a matter of goals being a lot harder to come by in the postseason and facing the toughest matchups night after night. \n\nThe lessened offence means most of the forwards lose value on average (about 0.3 wins worth) with none being hit harder than the fourth line. The trio already carries little value to begin with, and loses another 1.8 on top of that, meaning in the playoffs they provide sub-replacement level value on average. Again, it’s the matchups taking over as there are fewer places to hide a fourth line. With the top line and fourth line losing lots of value, the middle six on a Cup-winning team generally does pick up the slack; that’s possibly where the idea that a strong third-line centre is crucial to a championship-calibre team comes in. They get the second largest bump among forwards, suggesting it’s not that a team necessarily needs a strong third-line centre, but they do need one that can elevate his game in the playoffs. Though the Bruins didn’t win last year, [Charlie Coyle](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/bruins/charlie-coyle/)’s playoff excellence definitely comes to mind.\n\nAs for the defence, they’re dead even with projections on aggregate, but the value distribution changes dramatically. Most third pairs are a little better, while those usually strong second pairs really struggle relative to expectations on Cup-winning teams. Perhaps that’s due to them being used more often as shutdown pairs, but it’s certainly an interesting trend. \n\nThe top pair is where the biggest positive change comes from among a champion’s skaters. If you’re wondering why talking heads always wax poetic about the importance of having an elite No. 1 defender, it’s because of how they’ve generally elevated their game in the playoffs, becoming the most important skaters on the team when it matters most. On average, a team’s best defenceman has been 0.8 wins better in the playoffs, bringing their total value up to 3.3 wins on average (while top line centres drop to 2.9 wins). Pietrangelo, Carlson, Letang, Keith, Doughty, Chara all brought the heat in their Cup-winning seasons and unsurprisingly it’s Hedman and [Miro Heiskanen](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/stars/miro-heiskanen/) putting in work to lead Tampa Bay and Dallas to the final. Those types of defenders are the key to a lengthy playoff run.\n\nBut the most important player of all when it comes to the playoffs is, of course, the goalie, projected to be worth three wins, but earning closer to five on an average Cup winner.\n\n[![](https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2020/09/18152436/Screen-Shot-2020-09-18-at-3.23.50-PM.png)](https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2020/09/18152436/Screen-Shot-2020-09-18-at-3.23.50-PM.png)\n\nOn average, goalies on Cup-winning teams are _two_ _wins_ _better_ than projected. That says it all about building a Stanley Cup winning roster. A team can have the best group of skaters, but without a hot goalie, it’s tough to go very far. \n\nAs Mike Tyson once said, “everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.” In hockey that equates to the minute something goes wrong in between the pipes, essentially rendering any Cup checklist moot.\n\nGoaltending is by far the most important piece to any Cup-winning team and it’s no surprise that both [Andrei Vasilevskiy](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/lightning/andrei-vasilevskiy/) and [Anton Khudobin](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/stars/anton-khudobin/) have been very strong en route to their team’s respective final’s berth. The issue when it comes to goaltending is that it’s notoriously hockey’s most volatile position. That’s part of the chaos that’s bred in the postseason and it was only a year ago that Vasilevskiy was a big part of Tampa Bay’s demise, posting a grizzly .856 save percentage in the team’s four-game, first-round defeat. He’s turned the tables in these playoffs with a .931 save percentage and unsurprisingly, the team has followed.\n\nThese aren’t a strict set of rules, but they can be seen as guidelines based on past Cup winners. Any team checking a majority of the boxes should be well on their way to contending and with a little postseason luck on their side might hoist the Stanley Cup.\n\n_(Photo: Dave Sandford / NHLI via Getty Images)_\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.67614781Z","tags":null},"/reference/Stanley-Cup-contender-checklist-The-Athletic":{"title":"","content":"\n# Stanley Cup contender checklist: How does each playoff team stack up? – The Athletic\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e Referencing the Cup Checklist, we looked at what each NHL playoff team already has and what it still might need to be considered Cup-worthy.\n\nShayna Goldman, Dom Luszczyszyn\n\nMetadata: \nBoston Bruins,Tampa Bay Lightning,Toronto Maple Leafs,Florida Panthers,Carolina Hurricanes,New York Rangers,Pittsburgh Penguins,Washington Capitals,Dallas Stars,Colorado Avalanche,St. Louis Blues,Nashville Predators,Minnesota Wild,Calgary Flames,Edmonton Oilers,Los Angeles Kings,Vancouver Canucks,Vegas Golden Knights,NHL\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](https://theathletic.com/3186979/2022/03/16/stanley-cup-contender-checklist-how-does-each-playoff-team-stack-up/)\n\n---\n# \n\nStanley Cup contender checklist: How does each playoff team stack up?\n\n![DENVER, COLORADO - MARCH 13: Nazem Kadri #91 of the Colorado Avalanche skates against Trevor Lewis #22 of the Calgary Flames at Ball Arena on March 13, 2022 in Denver, Colorado.

Stylistically, there isn’t one right answer for how to build a team, as long as it’s constructed with good players that fit properly throughout the lineup.\n\nThe Stanley Cup recipe is a difficult one to master as there are different ways to interpret it, but looking at how it was cooked before offers some helpful patterns toward success. Based on a decade of championship meals from the 2010s, there are 10 common elements to look for when crafting a team worthy of contending. Every fine meal starts with a grocery list, and this one — the [Cup Checklist](https://theathletic.com/2077279/2020/09/21/cup-checklist-analyzing-the-rosters-from-the-last-decade-of-champions/) — is no different.\n\n-   Elite first-line center that’s among the very best players in the world.\n-   Elite first-line winger to support the elite center.\n-   Two other top-line wingers on each of the top two lines.\n-   Top-line center to play behind the elite center. \n-   Two more top-six forwards for depth in the middle six.\n-   Elite No. 1 defenseman.\n-   A second No. 1 defenseman to play behind him. \n-   A top-pairing defenseman to help anchor a strong second pair with the No. 2. \n-   Another top-pairing caliber defender to crush soft minutes on the third pair. \n-   A top-10 caliber starting goaltender.\n\nIt’s possible to make a great-tasting meal that’s Cup-worthy without every ingredient accounted for, but the best meals are the ones that have as many ingredients accounted for as possible. Not every team has it all, but the ones that have the most are the ones that are usually closest to competing for the Stanley Cup.\n\nSo does your team’s meal belong on Master Chef or Kitchen Nightmares? That’s the question teams have to be asking themselves going into the trade deadline because it’s the last chance to go to the market and improve their dish with a secret ingredient or two before it heads to the oven.\n\nEvery team will find themselves shopping over the next week with one common goal — to make the best meal possible. Some teams only need a finishing touch, some teams need spices to kick the flavor up a notch, and some teams are missing an entire side dish.\n\n\n### **Cup Checklist legend**\n\n_Gold Checkmark: Exceeds expectations, above acceptable range from average Cup-winner_ \n\n_Black Checkmark: Right on target, in line with average Cup-winner_\n\n_Grey Checkmark: Passable, below average relative to average Cup-winner_\n\n_Red X: A hole in the lineup, below acceptable range from average Cup-winner_\n\n\n\n### **Los Angeles**\n\n[![](https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/03/15153734/Screen-Shot-2022-03-15-at-3.33.51-PM.png)](https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/03/15153734/Screen-Shot-2022-03-15-at-3.33.51-PM.png)\n\nThe [Kings](https://theathletic.com/team/kings/) are one of this year’s biggest surprises and the model is still very steadfast that what we’re seeing out of them is a mirage.

Los Angeles isn’t ready for that yet. It might be worth pursuing some players with term — Jakob Chychrun comes to mind — but rentals should be out of the question.

Alex Iafallo spent much of last season in that spot, but his long scoring droughts led to him being dropped in the lineup.\n\nFiala is listed at 5 feet 10 and 205 pounds and is known as a swift skater with excellent acceleration and game-breaking abilities. He was headed toward being a restricted free agent but reportedly signed a seven-year, $55.125-million contract with the Kings that carries an annual salary cap hit of $7.875 million. He was a teammate of Kings winger [Viktor Arvidsson](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-03-04/viktor-arvidsson-kings-blue-jackets-overtime-nhl) in Nashville for several seasons.\n\n[Subscribe to Continue Reading](https://edge.platform.latimes.com/v1/destination/1?int_source=marketing_content\u0026int_medium=MD\u0026int_campaign=LAFA22\u0026int_id=3437\u0026returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.latimes.com%2Fsports%2Fhockey%2Fstory%2F2022-06-29%2Fkings-acquire-left-wing-kevin-fiala-from-minnesota-wild\u0026content_id=00000181-b134-dc75-a1fd-b9f5e2230000\u0026int_content=fallback_paywall)\n\nA native of Switzerland, Fiala was chosen 11th in the 2014 draft by Nashville. He scored 45 goals for the Predators in 204 games before they traded him to the Wild. In 215 games with the Wild he scored 79 goals and 186 points, including career bests in goals (33), game-winning goals (seven) and points (85) this season. He has scored 124 goals and 283 points in 419 games over eight NHL seasons.\n\nThe Kings chose Faber 45th overall in the second round of the 2020 draft. On Wednesday he was appointed a co-captain of the University of Minnesota hockey team for the upcoming season. He’s considered a potential top-four NHL defenseman but the Kings have a good amount of depth there, especially among right-handed shooters.\n\nThe Kings did not make general manager Rob Blake available for comment on Wednesday but said he will participate in a Zoom call on Thursday.\n\n___\n\nGet the latest on L.A.'s teams in the daily Sports Report newsletter.\n\nYou may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times.\n\n[![](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7a5578f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1125x1125+438+0/resize/100x100!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fba%2F21%2F8771bf6c69fecba403ad486e1659%2Fimg-5d1bb3e6-turbine-la-xard34z494df-20190702)](https://www.latimes.com/people/helene-elliott)\n\nHelene Elliott joined the Los Angeles Times’ sports department in 1989.

No. 2 center [Phillip Danault](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2021-08-11/kings-phillip-danault-new-home) made a strong impression in his Kings debut but ranked third with 51 points, behind Kopitar (67) and [Adrian Kempe](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-07-10/kings-adrian-kempe-agree-4-year-22-million-dollar-extension) (54).\n\nIt was imperative for Kopitar to lead the Kings in scoring as they built up to their 2012 and 2014 Stanley Cup championships, as they reached their peak, and then to keep them credible through their painful decline. A No. 1 center must carry his team, and Kopitar has done that at an elite level at both ends of the ice. Only Jeff Carter, in 2016-17, has interrupted the Slovenian center’s dominance since a 20-year-old Kopitar succeeded Michael Cammalleri as the team’s scoring leader in 2007-08.\n\nDanault hinted he could be their prime point producer when he scored a career-best 27 goals last season. Kempe more than doubled his career-high to score 35 goals but he’s a shooter and doesn’t pile up assists. Winger [Kevin Fiala](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-06-29/kings-acquire-left-wing-kevin-fiala-from-minnesota-wild) scored 33 goals and 85 points for Minnesota last season and could match or top that with extensive power play time. [Quinton Byfield](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2021-04-28/quinton-byfield-kings-nhl-debut-against-ducks) must prove he can handle a third-line center role before he can become an impact scorer.\n\nDoughty can see Kopitar being pushed. But not passed. “It’s going to be hard to beat Kopi in scoring, ever. He’s our No. 1 guy for all that type of stuff,” Doughty said. “Guys like Fiala or Kempe or Danault maybe have an opportunity to outscore him, but to be honest, I don’t really see it happening. I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s 15 of 16.”\n\nKopitar turned 35 in August, but he thinks the game quickly and doesn’t rely on speed alone. Danault’s arrival allowed coach Todd McLellan to drop Kopitar’s average ice time from 21 minutes 11 seconds to 20:46 last season, though Kopitar still led the Kings’ forwards and ranked third overall behind defensemen Doughty (25:44) and Matt Roy (20:59). He recorded a career-high 71 blocks and attempted 353 shots, his most since 2011-12, and won the Mark Messier Leadership Award.\n\n ![Kings center Anze Kopitar scores against Seattle Kraken goaltender Philipp Grubauer.](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2747e02/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3800x2533+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F76%2F22%2Fb06bcd114615ba5f0e3943a19913%2Fkraken-kings-hockey-99552.jpg)\n\nKings center Anze Kopitar scores against Seattle Kraken goalie Philipp Grubauer on March 26 at Crypto.com Arena.\n\n(Ashley Landis / Associated Press)\n\nMcLellan said Kopitar, Danault, Byfield and energetic center Blake Lizotte will dictate their playing time this season through their performances. Finding time for all of them would be a good problem to have.\n\n“Kopi is still a high-end player that’s capable of playing high-end minutes on our team or any other team in the league,” McLellan said. “You could drop him on the Stanley Cup champs and they’re going to play him those minutes because he’s a quality player.”\n\nKopitar, who has been the Kings’ captain since the “C” was awkwardly stripped from Dustin Brown in 2016, was grateful Danault took on some of his workload. But Kopitar isn’t conceding anything to age.\n\n“I feel good, I feel like I’m in good shape and still young enough to log all the minutes,” said Kopitar, who centered Fiala and Kempe during training camp and will skate alongside them to open the season.\n\n“Whoever wins the scoring title, it’s good for me or whoever it’s going to be. But it’s a matter of a team game. That’s what we’ve done in years past and that’s what we have to do. It’s a matter of making sure the team plays the way we need to play to make the playoffs, and then go deep and ultimately go all the way again.”\n\nSigning Danault as a free agent in 2021 was a morale-boosting move by general manager Rob Blake. It told players he recognized they’d made enough progress that investing in a top-six forward made strategic sense; Danault exceeded expectations and played a vital role in their return to the playoffs.\n\n[By acquiring Fiala](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-06-29/kings-acquire-left-wing-kevin-fiala-from-minnesota-wild) and quickly signing him to a seven-year, $55.1-million contract Blake told players that they deserved to have another asset who could help them go beyond one playoff round next time.\n\n“The feeling’s good, obviously,” Kopitar said. “I think it was a big step last year, especially with all the injuries that went through this locker room throughout the season, and a much-needed gaining of experience. Because playing in a Game 7 it’s a different type of deal, versus being a 4-1 series \\[loss\\] or 4-0. The majority of young guys who hadn’t experienced that, they now know how it feels like and what to expect.”\n\nBrown’s retirement leaves Kopitar, Doughty and goaltender [Jonathan Quick](https://www.latimes.com/sports/newsletter/2022-05-02/jonathan-quick-kings-playoffs-sports-report) as the only holdovers from the Cup-winning teams. Doughty is signed through 2026-27 but Quick is in the final season of his contract and Kopitar is signed through 2023-24. The window for them to win together is narrowing.\n\n ![Kings center Anze Kopitar controls the puck against the Florida Panthers in March.](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/40dfbd7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2815x1877+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa5%2F8c%2F6457b16649a09a44679acffa2f51%2Fkings-preview-hockey-96376.jpg)\n\n(Ashley Landis / Associated Press)\n\nIt’s not shut, but there’s some urgency. “I really do think before the three of us retire we’ll have one more Cup in us, at least,” Doughty said.\n\nIt’s not impossible. But for it to happen soon, Kopitar must be his old self and his younger teammates must make a good run at taking the team scoring crown from him.\n\n“We’re on, I guess, maybe the old side of things right now but between me, Quickie and Drew, I think we still have quite a bit left,” Kopitar said.\n\n“With the young guys developing as fast and as good as they did, I think it’s most definitely an opportunity to win again.”\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-19T07:15:46.67614781Z","tags":null}}
