What will the other teams in the division do?\n\t1. Coaching\n\t2. Free agents\n\t3. Players asking to be traded\n\t4. Teams looking to move into the playoffs\n\t5. Vegas\n\t\t1. Fits almost all of those things\n\t\t2. Very little cap space\n\t6. Vancouver\n\t\t1. JT Miller\n\t\t2. Quinn Hughes\n\t\t3. Elias Petterson\n\t7. Anaheim\n\t\t1. Lots of cap space\n2. What happens at the draft?\n\t1. 19th overall in the first round\n\t2. Six picks, no seventh rounder\n\t3. Third rounder went to Nashville in the [Viktor Arvidsson trade](https://www.nhl.com/kings/news/la-kings-trade-draft-picks-for-viktor-arvidsson/c-325544088)\n\t4. Own Pens third rounder from [Jeff Carter trade](https://www.nhl.com/news/jeff-carter-traded-to-penguins-by-kings/c-323556688)\n\t5. Last year the Kings weren't quality over quantity, an artifact of the COVID year\n\t6. Blockbuster deals usually require trading a first rounder, but questioning the need for such\n\t7. 50 context limit and 90 player reserve list\n\t\t1. Didn't count players in junior\n\t\t2. If every RFA and UFA signed, 49 contracts \n3. Re-signing Adrian Kempe\n\t1. Arbitration eligible\n\t2. How many years of UFA are you buying?\n4. Re-signing Mikey Anderson\n\t1. Walker and Roy both signed second contracts for around $3M/year\n\t2. The Athletic said he's the 8th best shorten defensemen in the league\n5. Left defense\n\t1. Anderson/Bjornfot Young guys\n\t2. Edler/Maata veterans who might not have been anticipated to return, but now might\n\t3. Bjornfot is only 20/21, had great tools, already 100 NHL games played, fell out of the lineup. Great with Roy, not great with Durzi. Might need a steady defenseman. He had a better season then just how it ended.\n6. Right defense\n\t1. Drew doughty is a lock. Roy is probable.\n\t2. Walker off of injury\n\t3. Durzi and Spence showed they can play. \n\t4. Faber, Grans, Clarke\n\t5. Spence and Grans can play on Ontario\n\t6. Durzi is no longer eager exempt. Clarke can only play in junior or the NHL \n\t7. What does the organization think is most important? Continuity, development, experience? Defense, offense?\n\t8. Didn't even mention Strand, Stetcher, Moverare, Wolanin\n7. RFA forwards other than Kempe\n\t1. JAD, Grundstrom, Lemieux, Villardi, Lias Andersson \n\t2. Grundstrom has a playoff game and did well. Maybe the most improved. Consistent when I'm the lineup. Impactful bottom six. Dustin Brown light.\n\t3. JAD \u0026 Villardi: both probably qualified, figure out where they slot on training camp. \n\t4. LW1 and LW3 are up for grabs. And probably 4 total wing spots\n8. UFA veterans\n\t1. AA, Frk, Tynan\n\nhttps://lakingsinsider.com/2022/09/12/10-offseason-questions-final-update/","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T11:07:29.19803917Z","tags":null},"/Adrian-Kempe":{"title":"Adrian Kempe","content":"\n# Adrian Kempe\n\nNHL.com | Twitter\n-|-\n[Adrian Kempe](https://www.nhl.com/player/adrian-kempe-8477960) | [@adriankempe](https://twitter.com/adriankempe)\n\nPosition | Shoots | Height | Weight | Age | Birthday | Birthplace | Draft\n-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-\n C | L | 6'2\" | 200 | 26 | 1996-09-13 | Kramfors, SWE | 2014 LAK, 1st rd, 29th pk (29th overall)\n\n##### Unprocessed Articles\n- \n\n## NHL  Coverage\n- \n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\n- \n\n\n## Post-Draft Coverage\n- \n\n\n## Pre-Draft\n- ","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T11:07:29.19803917Z","tags":null},"/Alex-Turcotte":{"title":"Alex Turcotte","content":"\n# Alex Turcotte\n\nNHL.com | Twitter\n-|-\n[Alex Turcotte](https://www.nhl.com/player/alex-turcotte-8481532) | [Turcotte__71](https://twitter.com/Turcotte__71)\n\nPosition | Shoots | Height | Weight | Age | Birthday | Birthplace | Draft\n-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-\nC | L | 5'11\" | 185 | 21 | 2001-02-26 | Elk Grove, IL, USA | 2019 LAK, 1st rd, 5th pk (5th overall)\n \n\n## NHL  Coverage\n- \n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\n- \n\n\n## Post-Draft Coverage\n- \n\n\n## Pre-Draft\n- https://www.broadstreethockey.com/2019/6/12/18661726/alex-turcotte-draft-profile-stats-analysis-analytics-highlights-2019-nhl-draft\n- https://www.diebytheblade.com/2019/5/7/18534846/draft-profile-alex-turcotte\n- https://www.habseyesontheprize.com/nhl-entry-draft-picks-2019/2019/6/14/18663582/alex-turcotte-2019-nhl-draft-prospect-profile-video-highlights-stats-scouting-report-analysis\n- https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/blackhawks/2019-nhl-draft-profile-c-alex-turcotte\n- https://www.thedraftanalyst.com/2019-nhl-draft/2019-draft-profile-c-alex-turcotte/","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T11:07:29.19803917Z","tags":null},"/All-The-Kings-Men":{"title":"All The Kings Men","content":"\n# All The Kings Men\n\nURL | Feed | Twitter\n-|-|-\n[All The Kings Men Homepage](https://www.nhl.com/kings/fans/podcast) | [ATKM Feed](https://feeds.simplecast.com/pFyX1PZC) | [@KingsMenPodcast](https://twitter.com/KingsMenPodcast) \n\n\n\n## Episodes\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T11:07:29.19803917Z","tags":null},"/An-enthusiastic-Gabe-Vilardi-has-made-an-impression-on-teammates-and-coaches-in-camp":{"title":"An enthusiastic Gabe Vilardi has made an impression on teammates and coaches in camp","content":"\n# An enthusiastic Gabe Vilardi has made an impression on teammates and coaches in camp\n\n| Link | Date Published | Site |\n|---|---|---|\n| [An enthusiastic Gabe Vilardi has made an impression on teammates and coaches in camp](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/05/an-enthusiastic-gabe-vilardi-has-made-an-impression-on-teammates-and-coaches-in-camp/)  | 2022-10-05  | [[LA Kings Insider]]\n\n## Contributors:\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n## Players\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Trevor Moore]]\n- [[Phillip Danault]]\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n## Summary\n- It’s certainly been an impressive start to training camp for Gabe Vilardi. That start goes beyond the two goals he scored last night. It goes beyond the spot on the first power play unit he’s manned early in training camp. It goes beyond the opportunity he’s currently seizing by skating with the second forward line.\n\n## Notes\n### On Attitude\n\n\u003e It looks like he’s having a lot of fun and I think that’s a huge part of it. Give him credit for being enthusiastic and being excited and his teammates love playing with him right now that’s a real good sign. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e When Gabe is having fun, it’s infectious and I think he plays his best hockey when he’s having fun. I think when he’s stressed, or he’s not feeling great about his game, it weighs on him. It feels like he’s in a great headspace \\[right now] and we need that going forward. -- [[Trevor Moore]]\n\n\u003e You can tell his vibes are so positive and he wants to be a game changer. It’s definitely a big difference I’ve seen so far this year and we need him. We need him to be like that and the more players we have like that, the better we’ll be. -- [[Phillip Danault]]\n\n### On Skill\n\n\u003e Gabe has always been a big, strong kid, you can see that when he wins puck battles. He’s working really hard right now and I think it’s showing. The skill has always been there, it’s just a matter of him getting that confidence and doing those little things. -- [[Trevor Moore]]\n\n### On the switch from Center to Wing\n\n\u003e I’ve got to continue to work on \\[the defensive zone], you can always get better with your wall play and that’s important for me when playing as a winger, taking care of my own zone first. I’ve been on the wing for around a year now and I’m still adjusting. I’m going to continue to work and take it day-by-day. -- [[Gabe Vilardi]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T11:07:29.19803917Z","tags":null},"/Arthur-Kaliyev":{"title":"Arthur Kaliyev","content":"\n# Arthur Kaliyev\n\nNHL.com | Twitter\n-|-\n[Arthur Kaliyev](https://www.nhl.com/player/arthur-kaliyev-8481560) | [@Arthur_Kaliyev](https://twitter.com/Arthur_Kaliyev)\n\nPosition | Shoots | Height | Weight | Age | Birthday | Birthplace | Draft\n-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-\nRW | L | 6'2\" | 210 | 21 | 2001-06-26 | Tashkent, UZB | 2019 LAK, 2nd rd, 2nd pk (33rd overall)\n\n##### Unprocessed Articles\n- \n\n## NHL  Coverage\n- \n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\n- \n\n\n## Post-Draft Coverage\n- \n\n\n## Pre-Draft\n- ","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T11:07:29.19803917Z","tags":null},"/Gabe-Vilardi":{"title":"Gabe Vilardi","content":"\n# Gabe Vilardi\n\nNHL.com | Twitter\n-|-\n[Gabe Vilardi](https://www.nhl.com/player/gabriel-vilardi-8480014) | [@Gabe_Vilardi13](https://twitter.com/Gabe_Vilardi13)\n\nPosition | Shoots | Height | Weight | Age | Birthday | Birthplace | Draft\n-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-\nW | R | 6'3\" | 215 | 23 | 1999-08-16 | Kingston, ON, CA| 2017 LAK, 1st rd, 11th pk (11th overall)\n\n##### Unprocessed Articles\n- \n\n## NHL  Coverage\nDate | Title\n---|---\n2022-10-05 | [[An enthusiastic Gabe Vilardi has made an impression on teammates and coaches in camp]]\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\nDate | Title\n---|---\n\n\n\n## Post-Draft Coverage\nDate | Title\n---|---\n\n\n\n## Pre-Draft Coverage\nDate | Title\n---|---\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T11:07:29.19803917Z","tags":null},"/LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# LA Kings Insider\n\nURL | Feed | Twitter\n-|-|-\n[Homepage](https://lakingsinsider.com/) | [Feed](https://lakingsinsider.com/feed/) | [@lakingsinsider](https://twitter.com/lakingsinsider) \n\n\n## Articles\n| Title | Date Published |\n|---|---|\n| [[Three days in, teammates and coaches weigh in on the exciting addition of Kevin Fiala]] | 2022-09-24 |\n|  [[Taylor Ward feeling ready for first NHL training camp with fast start at Rookie Faceoff]] | 2022-09-19 |\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T11:07:29.19803917Z","tags":null},"/Quinton-Byfield":{"title":"Quinton Byfield","content":"\n# Quinton Byfield\n\nNHL.com | Twitter\n-|-\n[Quinton Byfield](https://www.nhl.com/player/quinton-byfield-8482124) | [@byfield55](https://twitter.com/byfield55)\n\nPosition | Shoots | Height | Weight | Age | Birthday | Birthplace | Draft\n-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-\n C | L | 6'5\" | 220 | 20 | 2002-08-19 | Newmarket, ON, CAN | 2020 LAK, 1st rd, 2nd pk (2nd overall)\n\n##### Unprocessed Articles\n- \n\n## NHL  Coverage\n- \n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\n- \n\n\n## Post-Draft Coverage\n- \n\n\n## Pre-Draft\n- [A Development Plan for Quinton Byfield](https://jhanhky.substack.com/p/a-development-plan-for-quinton-byfield?s=r) -

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T11:07:29.19803917Z","tags":null},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site.

Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide.

However, there’s a lot more talent in the USA Hockey pipeline, and one of those names is Alex Turcotte. The 18 year old Wisconsin Badger-commit was a force this season on an already stacked team, and has all the tools to be a top line player at the NHL level.\n\n**2019** [**NHL Draft**](http://www.sbnation.com/nhl-draft) **Profile: Alex Turcotte**\n\nPosition/team: C/USNTDP Juniors, USHL (University of Wisconsin commit)  \n2018-19 Statistics: 12 G, 22 A in 16 GP  \nSize: 5’11” 185\n\n**Pre-draft rankings**\n\nNo. 4 (NA Skaters) by [NHL Central Scouting](http://www.nhl.com/ice/draftprospectbrowse.htm)  \nNo. 5 by [Future Considerations](https://futureconsiderations.ca/top-rankings-2019/)  \nNo. 4 by [ISS Hockey](https://www.isshockey.com/iss-hockey-releases-iss-top-31-for-june-rankings-of-the-top-prospects-for-the-2019-nhl-draft/)  \nNo. 3 by [Pronman/The Athletic](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516590\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://theathletic.com/970746/2019/05/21/pronmans-2019-nhl-draft-board-top-107-prospects/\u0026referrer=sbnation.com\u0026sref=https://www.broadstreethockey.com/2019/6/12/18661726/alex-turcotte-draft-profile-stats-analysis-analytics-highlights-2019-nhl-draft\u0026xcust=___sb__p_18425767__t_w__d_D)\n\n## What’s there to like?\n\nA whole lot, as a matter of fact. Turcotte possesses one of the more explosive games in this year’s draft class outside the obvious in Jack Hughes and Kaapo Kakko. Something that I noticed a lot in him is the different ways he can beat defensemen and the goalie. His speed isn’t dominant like his USA teammate in Hughes, but when he gets going he’s tough to stop. Not only does he possess a good top speed, but he’s elusive and can break the puck out efficiently with his skating talent alone. Combine this with his stellar ice vision, passing ability, and dangles you have a multi-dimensional center breakout option that is extremely difficult to defend against.\n\nAnd there in lies potentially Turcotte’s greatest ability: to drive play. Turcotte is able to push play with simply his skating with how explosive he becomes at top speed and his elusiveness. These abilities are so vital in today’s NHL and especially at the center position. If you have a center who can break the puck up with ease, it makes the defensemen’s job all the more simple and relieves some of the pressure they face to carry the puck. As seen by the following [data](https://public.tableau.com/profile/mitchell.brown1648#!/vizhome/CHLComparison/Dashboard3) from the fantastic [Mitchell Brown](https://twitter.com/mitchlbrown?lang=en), Turcotte enters the zone almost just as well as Jack Hughes.\n\n ![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AV-zEKNgTA2oLT07Fbdg7NidBK4=/0x0:966x434/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:966x434):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16334230/Screenshot_2019_06_11_at_6.51.03_PM.png) \n\nDespite his smaller stature at just 5’11” Turcotte consistently hovers around the crease. He’s not afraid to mix it up down low and be physical with his opposition which creates another facet that teams have to prepare for. He’s not going to be a wrecking ball out there, but he’s physical enough that defensemen are going to think twice about the guy chasing them.\n\nNot only does Turcotte wow you with his offensive abilities, he’s no slouch defensively either. His 185 pound frame allows him to compensate for his height, and makes him all the more difficult to deal with offensively and defensively. He’s routinely in position in his own zone and is relentless with his puck pursuit. His aggressive forechecking combined with his speed to recover and overall hockey instincts make him a true threat on the defensive side of the puck.\n\nHe’ll never be the goal scorer that his teammate Cole Caufield is, but his passing ability combined with scoring wingers should make for a dynamic line. Turcotte’s natural passing ability combined with his elite hockey sense to know where the puck and his teammates are and are going to be, make him a lethal threat on the offensive side of the puck. I envision him being an elite play-driving forward at the NHL level with the ability to rack up high assist numbers. Turcotte is easily (if you couldn’t tell by now) one of my favorite players of this draft class.\n\n## What’s not to like?\n\nHonestly the only true fault with Turcotte is for a centerman, he’s not the biggest guy in the world. But once again with his tenacity on the forecheck and overall pace of play, I don’t see it being a major issue. If he can get closer to the 200 pound mark and still retain his speed and explosiveness, I think it would easily compensate his height at the NHL level. If not, worst case he moves to the wing where he can still be a dynamic playmaker and solid defensive winger.\n\n## How would he fit in the [Flyers](https://www.broadstreethockey.com/)’ system?\n\nHe would be right there with Morgan Frost and Joel Farabee and that’s not even up for debate. Turcotte is by far one of the most talented forwards of this draft class and one of the most well-rounded ones as well. He would be a top prospect in the organization the moment he’d be drafted, but sadly, I can’t imagine a way he slips that far.\n\n## Could the Flyers actually get him?\n\nWhich leads me to the next point of no, I don’t conceive a way where the Flyers do get him. The only way I can envision the Flyers drafting Alex Turcotte is by trading up into the top five which doesn’t seem likely. If the Flyers are going to trade the 11th overall pick it seems more than likely it will be trading for a proven NHL talent, rather than acquiring another draft pick in the process. It would be a massive surprise if he falls even outside the top seven and hell if he slips outside of the top five I’d be on the phones immediately looking to get a deal done. The Flyers do have nine draft picks to spare, so might as well use them to get a guy like Turcotte.\n\n## Highlights\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LX-OUssDzyI?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T11:07:29.202039193Z","tags":null},"/reference/2019-NHL-Draft-Alex-Turcotte-Die-By-The-Blade":{"title":"","content":"\n# Draft Profile: Alex Turcotte - Die By The Blade\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e DBTB –\n \nThe Buffalo Sabres fanbase received a bit of disappointment at the NHL Draft Lottery, as they fell from #5 overall to #7.

But do not despair. The good news is that regardless of selection #5 or #7, they will add an excellent, high-end prospect to a fairly deep pool of young players.\n\nThe question is, who is that prospect?\n\nThere is a pile of players in the #3-#12 range that Jason Botterill could believably target given the Sabres need for more talent is pretty broad. All sorts of skill sets, from big playmaking centermen to small, quick goal scoring wings can be had at that #7 spot. I’ll take this opportunity to profile one here.\n\n**ALEX TURCOTTE, C, US DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM**\n\nAnother guy (see Zegras, Trevor or Boldy, Matthew) from the US Development Program who has lived in the shadow of Jack Hughes for the past two years, the 6’0 185# Turcotte spent much of last year laboring behind Hughes. He eventually took over as the U-17 top centerman and showed well once Hughes was called up to the U-18 NTDP team full-time. After his strong performance leading the U-17 team, and performing well in limited time with the U-18 team, the left-shot Turcotte came into his draft season as a guy who was thought to be a serious challenger for #2 overall. That talk got derailed early, as he went down with a nagging hip/back injury and missed the first dozen or so games for the NTDP. His return was anything but triumphant, as he immediately went down with another injury – a shoulder, presumably – in his first game back. So he missed basically the first two months before coming back right before Christmastime, an absence that saw him drop in my rankings. But once he did come back, the NTDP really threw him in the deep end, as Hughes was up with the USA World Juniors team at the time. And the Illinois native didn’t disappoint.\n\nHe finished with an eye-popping 62P in 37 games, including 27 goals. That’s actually slightly better than Hughes as far as PPG (2.17 to 2.0) which isn’t too shabby when you’re playing second fiddle to the top prospect in the Draft. Leading up to the U-18 Championships, where most scouts were waiting to see what Turcotte could do, he managed to get sick and was iffy to play right up until game-time. All he did there was put up 9P in 7 games! So he’s not only extremely skilled, but he’s a gamer! You can watch some of that action [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9N_eVbwfJY) (I apologize for the music). See what a little Thera-Flu can do?\n\nSo what does this kid bring to the table? Turcotte’s game is one of speed, power, and aggression. Has a powerful stride that recalls some of Eichel’s jaunts through the Neutral Zone. A single stride just propels him down the ice. He’s better playing a linear game where he takes a lot of straight lines than someone like a Zegras or Hughes, who have superior edges and lateral movement and lean on that to take advantage of defenders. Turcotte would rather go through you than around you. He’s got remarkable timing – he can find seams at top speed and make a good judgment about exploiting them, with or without the puck. What’s special about him is his tempo. Turcotte always plays with pace, whether offensively or defensively. His skating might not be as graceful or as dazzling as a Hughes or Zegras, but it’s the explosion and the strength of his lower body that gets him where he needs to be ahead of everyone else.\n\nBlessed with exceptional mitts, Turcotte can take bouncing pucks and turn them into pretty saucer passes or pick pucks out of the air on the fly and beat guys wide to attack the net. And attack the net he does. Not afraid of physical play, he seems to relish it, and will fearlessly power through checks or sticks to get to his spot around the cage. Around the net is where he does a lot of his damage, both in terms of scoring goals or setting them up. His play style makes it really tough to take the puck away, either in open ice or along the wall, as he uses that strong lower body much like Crosby to protect the puck from defenders and maintain his balance even against much bigger players. And in open ice, look out. He's got the burst and the superior stick handling to make a defender look silly. Intense competitor who’s motor never slows down, he understands how to manipulate a defense to get open looks while at the same time always being cognizant of his defensive responsibilities and rarely leaves open ice where the other team can get a good chance. Defensively, more than willing. Turcotte has a great feel for defending off the puck, and he’s so confident in his on-puck skills that he will happily pressure a puck carrier without any concern about losing his man or getting beat. Which rarely happens. Very good in the dot as well, I think somewhere in the 58% range. [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvR0e2wpj3c) are some more highlights from the NTDP games for your viewing pleasure.\n\nDoes this guy have a weakness? Not many. His shot is sub-par, honestly. It lacks velocity and accuracy, so he rarely uses it from distance, preferring to operate around the crease, which isn't that big of a drawback, as he's more of a pass-first guy than a shooter. Make no mistake, his speed, hands and smarts make him a very effective finisher in transition. A true puck hound, his speed and determination make him a nightmare on the forecheck but his frenetic style can lend itself to getting banged up, which may become an issue as he plays bigger opponents who can keep up with him skating-wise. In other words, he takes a lot of hits. As far as his competition, I think he’s benefited to some degree from playing behind Hughes, so he hasn’t faced as much of the best defenders night-in, night out. So I’m a little concerned about how high-end his offensive skill is: is he a Couturier/Kesler type of player, which is VERY good, or is there more? Can he carry a line and produce like a Bergeron/Couture? I’m inclined to think the former, but I would not at all be surprised by the latter. Either way, you're getting a heck of a player. If you’re looking for a comparable for Turcotte, one that always gets me is Dougie Gilmour. Not quite as aggressive as Killer (who is?), he's got the same combination of high-end speed, skill, two-way play, and desire in a similarly sized package.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T11:07:29.202039193Z","tags":null},"/reference/2019-NHL-Draft-Alex-Turcotte-Eyes-On-The-Prize":{"title":"","content":"\n# 2019 NHL Draft prospect: Alex Turcotte could become an elite centremen - Eyes On The Prize\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e There aren’t many players who will be taken before the American in the first round.\n\nDavid St-Louis@DavidSt_Louis\n\nMetadata: \n\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](https://www.habseyesontheprize.com/nhl-entry-draft-picks-2019/2019/6/14/18663582/alex-turcotte-2019-nhl-draft-prospect-profile-video-highlights-stats-scouting-report-analysis)\n\n---\nThe elusive number-one center. It’s said that the way to acquire one is through the draft, as rare are the occasions when a trade or a free-agent acquisition nets you the golden piece around which to build a team. Organizations have to collect their chips and play the lottery, hoping the balls fall in their favour to give them a chance at such a prospect.\n\nAlex Turcotte might not be a number-one-overall talent, but he arguably represents the best chance in the 2019 class after Jack Hughes to add a prospect with such a ceiling.\n\nBirthplace: **Island Lake, Illinois, USA**  \nDate of birth: **February 26, 2001**  \nShoots: **Left**  \nPosition: **Centre**  \nHeight: **5’11”**  \nWeight: **185 lbs.**  \nTeam: **U.S. National Team Development Program**\n\nCircumstances didn’t favour a great season from the centreman. He missed time due to an injury and on the biggest stage for prospects to prove themselves, the World Under-18 Championship, mononucleosis afflicted him. It makes his draft-year performance even more impressive in retrospect. His close to two-point-per-game pace with the USNTDP wasn’t surpassed by anyone other than Hughes, and Turcotte, contrary to his teammate, wasn’t always flanked with the most prolific goal-scorer in the history of the program in Cole Caufield.\n\n ![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a7E2PRhZvD0dKos8oby6ThXHal4=/0x0:554x403/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:554x403):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16343957/Screenshot_2019_06_14_Alex_Turcotte_at_eliteprospects_com.png) [EliteProspects](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/290043/alex-turcotte) \n\nFew draft-eligible prospects could clam to play the game at the same intensity as Turcotte. His high motor is backed by a solid work ethic and understanding of the game. The centreman has the same care for his play on the defensive and offensive side of the ice. He drives the play on the attack, but as soon as possession is contested, he moves back in a sound defensive position, ready to track the puck back to his zone and help his defence.\n\nHe also reads passing lanes well and closes hard on his checks, tirelessly using his stick and body to separate the opposition from possession. The forward might only be 5’11”, but he can play the game with a physical edge.\n\nThe other element that fuels Turcotte’s two-way game is his skating. He is very quick and his wide stance gives him solid balance. The drawback of that stance is that it gives him less speed due to a shorter stride when he moves in a straight line. But considering Turcotte likes to rush up and down the ice with a prominent usage of crossovers, he still has more than enough momentum to burst past defenders when joining the attack.\n\nHe is just as agile a handler as he is a skater. He can open up and pivot, once again feet wide apart to help to protect, and he attacks defenders head-on to thread the puck through their skates.\n\n_Alex Turcotte wears #19 with the USNTDP_\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/54l2wrSFvFY?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nThe first clip in the video above is especially impressive. He rushes from the wide lane, but he doesn’t continue along the wall. He crosses over to the the middle of the ice, brings the puck inside the stick and feet of a defender, then bounces off the check off the opponent and slides the puck behind him to Matthew Boldy for a scoring chance at the door-step.\n\nThere are other examples of Turcotte’s capabilities in the video: his explosive cutbacks, his abrupt change of direction, and his quick hands fending off multiple opposing stick in tight.\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OKaYcGScxsg?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nOff the rush, Turcotte is more of a playmaker, but when his team is established in the offensive zone, to find him you have to look around the net.\n\nThis is where a lot of goals are scored, and the centreman understands how to maximize his success. This season in the USNTDP, he was the net-front presence on their power play. He distinguished himself not really by superior strength or size, but with his ability to get first touch on rebounding pucks and slide to the back post, in position to be on the receiving end of the high-skill plays of his teammates.\n\nHere’s a few sequences illustrating some aspects of Turcotte’s game: his reads, his patience in possession to wait for passing lanes to open, and how he works to steal pucks, find outlets and continuously get open around the net and the slot, pushing against defenders, circling high in the zone to escape his coverage.\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SO_JvLulm_k?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nTurcotte’s highlight reel will probably never be as long as some of his teammates; he isn’t as creative or as flashy. That being said, it’s very likely that he is the second player selected from the U.S Under-18 Developmental Program at the draft, due to the many elements of his play that will translate very well to the professional game. The centreman is effective because, all over the ice, he supports his teammates and makes plays that are conducive to enxtended possession.\n\n ![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vuktPCcjQTvpWo9WftuoPhOGzLk=/0x0:470x482/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:470x482):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16336849/1.png) \n\nFrom Mitch Brown’s [CHL tracking project](https://patreon.com/user?u=13951676)\n\nIt’s therefore no surprise just how well he scores on the shot rates in the advanced stats. He is at the top of the percentile for both Corsi for (ability to generate shot attempts) and Corsi against (ability to limit shot attempts). He also dominates almost all offensive categories, which speaks to his ability to be both a playmaker and scorer depending on the situation.\n\n### Rankings (not all rankings are final)\n\nButton/TSN: **#10**  \nDobber Prospects: **#3**  \nElite Prospects: **#6**  \nFuture Considerations: **#5**  \nHockey Prospect: **#4**  \nMcKenzie/TSN: **#11**  \nNHL Central Scouting: **#4** (NA skaters)  \nPronman/The Athletic: **#3**\n\nNext year, Turcotte will play for the University of Wisconson.

Turcotte, who’s father Alfie was a first-round pick of the Montreal Canadiens in 1983, was a key contributor for both the NTDP’s under-17 and under-18 programs, including a midseason promotion to the latter where he produced 16 points in 19 games in a limited role. Turcotte is a low-maintenance center in that he can excel in both optimal and non-optimal conditions, plus handle physicality better than most offensive forwards. He is a fast, agile skater with a wide, powerful stride and the balance of a seasoned NHL power forward. Getting knocked off the puck while he’s either static or moving is something you rarely see.\n\nTurcotte possesses superior vision and passing ability, and it’s clear from his first shift that he understands the game’s intricacies and nuances that require a center to develop chemistry with his linemates. He plays smart hockey with his head on a swivel and attacks with decisiveness, maintaining situational awareness no matter how fast he’s motoring up ice. Turcotte is one of the few draft-eligible forwards who can time his passes with precision while moving as fast as he can. Although he seems to like to defer to the pass, Turcotte owns a hard, accurate wrist shot with a quick release, and he’s proven to snap off high-velocity shots within tight windows.\n\n\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NTDP?src=hash\u0026amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003e#NTDP\u003c/a\u003e: Jack Hughes (Ranked No. 1) scored twice in his return as the 18’s crushed Adrian College 8-3.

From scoring 48 points in 68 games in his first juniors season, Arthur Kaliyev went on to score 102 points, good for 6th in the OHL, and in fact seven behind current Flyer prospect Morgan Frost. Kaliyev was named to the OHL 2nd all star team, and though he still has more to prove, Kaliyev is looking like a sure fire 1st round prospect.\n\n## 2019 [NHL Draft](http://www.sbnation.com/nhl-draft) Profile: Arthur Kaliyev\n\nLeft Wing / USA / Hamilton (OHL)\n\n2018-19 Statistics: 51 G, 51 A in 67 GP\n\nSize: 6-foot-2, 190 pounds\n\n#### Pre-draft rankings\n\nNo. 7 (North American Skaters) by NHL Central Scouting\n\nNo. 30 by Future Considerations\n\nNo. 23 by ISS Hockey\n\nNo. 13 by TSN/Mckenzie\n\n### What’s there to like?\n\nKaliyev is a forward who I’d describe as simply a pure goalscorer. He possesses an excellent wrist shot, and he is effective at getting to the slot for prime scoring chances. Speaking of his shot, he picks corners like he isn’t even trying. This certainly helps when he can read offensive plays as effectively as he does. It’s not luck that he is always finding himself in good scoring positions. It’s very reminiscent of Oskar Lindblom in how effective he is at being in the right place at the right time. His mental processing of the offensive side of the game, along with the goal scoring abilities of a pure sniper, make him an incredibly dangerous weapon when crossing the opposing blue line.\n\nHe’s also improved his playmaking. Kaliyev has become far more patient with the puck, and is good at keeping the puck moving in the offensive zone. He now runs the Hamilton power play, being set up along the half-boards. Even if he is projected as a sniper, his overall offensive game is very good. There isn’t one aspect of his offensive game that I could find fault with.\n\n### What’s not to like?\n\nHe is a player that is willing to take a risk to extend a play, which is a double edged sword. When the risk doesn’t pay off, Kaliyev can get caught out of the play or give away the puck. This is more evident as well because he does not have any particularly defensively oriented instincts. While some may argue that he is there to score, not back check, Kaliyev can sometimes get into habits reminiscent of Jake Voracek on defense, which can be frustrating.\n\nHe’s probably not going to be a guy that carries a line, and will require a playmaking center to feed him the puck. In fairness, this can be said about a lot of wingers. He’s good at taking on defenders one on one, but this isn’t always a reliable skill in the more bruising NHL.\n\n### How would he fit in the [Flyers](https://www.broadstreethockey.com/)’ system?\n\nThere’s one type of player the Flyers lack: a true sniper. Kaliyev would fulfill this role, and would look to project into a very good first line scorer. Imagining Giroux regresses, the first line could be Kaliyev-Couturier-Konecny. The thought of that delights me. Heck, eventually, it could even be Kaliyev-Frost-Konecny. I would like one order of that, please.\n\n### Could the Flyers actually get him?\n\nIf they don’t trade the pick, they absolutely could. It would be a surprising pick, given Kaliyev’s ranking, but it’s 100% possible. Teams like to draft more important positions like center and defense high in the first round, rather than scoring wingers. But, given the Flyers’ organizational needs, I wouldn’t object to the Flyers shocking everybody and taking Kaliyev early. It won’t happen, but hey I can dream.\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TwnkMElynFo?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T11:07:29.202039193Z","tags":null},"/reference/2019-NHL-Draft-Arthur-Kaliyev-Eyes-On-The-Prize":{"title":"","content":"\n# 2019 NHL Draft: Questions linger about Arthur Kaliyev’s NHL projections - Eyes On The Prize\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e Kaliyev has feasted on Junior defence, but there are a few signs that he will be able to adapt to better competition.\n\nDavid St-Louis@DavidSt_Louis\n\nMetadata: \n\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](https://www.habseyesontheprize.com/nhl-entry-draft-picks-2019/2019/6/13/18662114/arthur-kaliyev-2019-nhl-draft-prospect-profile-video-highlights-stats-scouting-report-analysis)\n\n---\nPolarizing is the appropriate word to describe Arthur Kaliyev. Depending on the method used to evaluate him — a more analytics-intensive approach or scouting for tools, game sense, and projectability — Kaliyev can either come out as one of the better potential picks in the draft or one with a lot of question marks, some would say even red flags.\n\nBirthplace: **Tashkent, Uzbekistan**  \nDate of birth: **June 26, 2001**  \nShoots: **Left**  \nPosition: **Wing**  \nHeight: **6’2”**  \nWeight: **190 lbs.**  \nTeam: **Hamilton Bulldogs (OHL)**\n\nThe main issue in ranking Kaliyev is that he operates quietly. He isn’t a _put your head down, hustle, and skate the puck into the net_ kind of player. He isn’t a power foward who overpowers his peers in front of the net (even if his stature would suggest he could be), and he isn’t a flashy dangler who goes through entire teams to score.\n\nKaliyev drifts, glides, floats away from the sight of the opposing team and, to an extent, spectators, and comes up with a few goals, inflating his totals higher and higher, forcing eyes onto him after they glance at the stat sheet to figure out just what is going on.\n\nHe is quite unique. It’s hard to reconcile 51 goals — an incredible feat for a draft-eligible player, one that hasn’t been matched by many over the years and puts him in company of players like Alex DeBrincat and Jeff Skinner — to what appears to be a detached playstyle. The sheer numbers are impressive, but will he be able to replicate his success as he rises in the levels of hockey?\n\n ![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sbhri9HfaWJX2B4jPJuWoaMijaI=/0x0:768x176/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:768x176):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16341162/Screenshot_2019_06_12_Arthur_Kaliyev_at_eliteprospects_com.png) [EliteProspects](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/316114/arthur-kaliyev) \n\nThe number-one element that will help him score goals at the next level is his shot. Kaliyev is a deadly weapon from the right faceoff circle, his off-side as a left-shot winger. He scored 20 of his 51 goals on the power play, and a good part of those markers where from that position.\n\nKaliyev fires pucks with a short-windup slapshot. He understands that the most important aspect of his release is speed: how quickly he can get a puck sliding toward him to fly to the net before the goalie has time to get to his left post. He takes a quick peek at the net as he is about to receive a pass and adjusts his shot to best have it slip by the netminder’s coverage.\n\nThe first sequence in the video below has a great camera angle of Kaliyev’s work at the right circle. He stands very low in the zone, below the dot and closer to the goal line. It doesn’t give him as much net to shoot at, but it’s the furthest distance for the goalie to travel to block his shot. As the puck slides to him, he engages the rotation of his body by opening up his hips and pointing his right foot toward the net, adding power to his shot but still controlling his release to place the puck between the post and the glove of the goalie.\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tjc2C07lhXY?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nThat’s not to say that Kaliyev can’t just hammer it home, which he does a couple of times in the video from the same power-play spot. He simply adapts his release to the situation. There’s a clip in the video where the winger one-times a pass that falls completely behind him, strictly using his body rotation to get it on net. He also chooses a catch-and-release wrist-shot motion when he feels that more elevation will be necessary to beat the goalie. Finally, when he faces a fully-set netminder, his shot becomes a playmaking weapon. He shoots for rebounds, keeping the puck low or transforming his firing motion into a hard pass to the back post for a tap-in attempt, and fakes using his release to thread a pass to teammates in the slot.\n\nHe can take the puck through the defence himself at times. He will chain a few rapid moves to thread the puck inside opposing sticks and skates and get a one-on-one chance with the goalie. But he is at his best when being set up.\n\nThe winger is all about finding quiet ice. He controls his skating, trying to join the attack deceptively and remain unchecked for the longest time possible. This is how he scores his goals at even strength. Being left alone in the offensive zone can be a product of some lapses in defensive coverage — and there are a lot of them in Junior hockey — but also of the skating routes he chooses and his ability to anticipate offensive and defensive schemes.\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NVj2RquiNjY?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nIn the clips above, you can see Kaliyev slow down, move east-west to remain in a passing lane, or change the position of his stick (bringing it behind him, for example) to create a new seam in which to receive the puck. He also waits for the defence to be pushed back before drifting into the zone. Trailing the play gives him space to get closer to the net and fire. When the puck gets to the point, the winger doesn’t immediately rush the net, but aims to arrive at the back post at the same time as the blue-line shot hits the net. Stick on the ice, he gets prime rebound occasions.\n\nThose natural tendencies contribute to making him the goal-scorer that he is. Being able to find and create space and time yourself for the best opportunities are skills. The drawback is that it makes him play at a slower pace compared to his peers, and this is where the common questions surrounding the prospect come from.\n\nKaliyev is the guy who will sometime forfeit defensive positioning or a battle for a loose puck to take a step toward the offence, anticipating or hoping that his team wins possession and he gets an opportunity to set himself up for a scoring chance at the other end of the ice. The good ones start from rapid transitions, and he definitely knows that. The winger can also force some passes as he takes the puck from zone to zone, as his preferred play is to arrive as the shooting option in the offensive zone.\n\nIt comes down to this: It’s rare to see the scorer use the full extent of his motor. Sometimes it’s for good reason (as in the above examples of his goals), but other times it would benefit him to raise the tempo. He isn’t a top skater, but even considering his upright form and his lack of knee-bend, Kaliyev can still muster some speed, especially with the usage of crossovers.\n\nAlthough the player he is up against in this sequence is Kevin Bahl (who isn’t exactly a speedster), you can see Kaliyev, enticed by the breakaway opportunity, separate with quick bursts and take the puck to the net.\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4XZOWmAQyqY?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nHis shot should allow him to produce at the NHL level, but if he wants to have further success and feature on the goal-scoring leaderboard he will have to adjust his feel for where the space is in the offensive zone and his goal-scoring timing to the much higher pace. That will require him to work on his skating and generally play the game a few higher gears.\n\nThe faith in his capacity to do that is reflected in the rankings of the prospect over different scouting services.\n\n### Rankings (not all rankings are final)\n\nButton/TSN: **#13**  \nDobber Prospects: **#18**  \nElite Prospects: **#11**  \nFuture Considerations: **#30**  \nHockey Prospect: **#34**  \nMcKenzie/TSN: **#13**  \nNHL Central Scouting: **#7** (NA skaters)  \nPronman/The Athletic: **#14**\n\nOn draft day, it’s likely that Kaliyev falls in the middle of the first round due to the risk he represents. There are other top prospects who don’t have the same concerns about their intensity who will likely go before the goal-scorer, but the package of skill he has also won’t let him fall too far in the first round.\n\nIt’s possible one lottery team with more analytically inclined views could find hidden value in the player. The dominant production that places him in somewhat elite company is one thing, but Kaliyev also comes out as quite an interesting prospect in Mitch Brown’s CHL tracking project.\n\n ![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3pcVoagCCMrGELgwM2fdyWILCq4=/0x0:471x472/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:471x472):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16334342/2.png) \n\nFrom Mitch Brown’s [CHL tracking project](https://www.patreon.com/user/posts?u=13951676)\n\nAs expected, he’s near the top of all shooting categories, but the passing grades also paint him as capable playmaker and transition skater, especially when it comes to getting the puck in the offensive zone.\n\nWhat’s really interesting is the entry defence category. Kaliyev scores highly in backchecking involvement, which runs counter to what is often perceived as a weakness in his game. This can’t be interpreted as proof of a strong two-way game for the forward since it’s supplementary information, but it’s still interesting to note his effectiveness in tracking pucks back and breaking plays in the neutral zone.\n\nHis playmaking capabilities, those defensive stats, and his work at times on the penalty kill could be good indications that there is more to Kaliyev than his goal-scoring identity. He represents an interesting project to take on for a team’s development staff as they look to broaden his game and push it to the next level to match how he will have to perform against professionals.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T11:07:29.202039193Z","tags":null},"/reference/2019-NHL-Draft-Arthur-Kaliyev-RSN":{"title":"","content":"\n# 2019 NHL draft profile: What's the read on Arthur Kaliyev? | RSN\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e The 2019 NHL entry draft is Friday and Saturday in Vancouver, British Columbia.

But we're really confident we're going to get a good player.\"\n\nThis week, we are breaking down options for the Flyers at No. 11.\n\n## **Arthur Kaliyev**\n\n**Position:** Right winger  \n**Height:** 6-foot-2  \n**Weight:** 194  \n**Shoots:** Left  \n**Team:** Hamilton\n\n### **Scouting report**\n\nKaliyev might be the second-best goal-scorer in the draft behind only USNTDP product Cole Caufield.\n\nThere's a lot to like with the New York native, from his size to his shot. He understands angles and spacing as he scored 51 goals in 67 regular-season games for the OHL's Hamilton Bulldogs. Kaliyev isn't just a finisher, either. He tallied 51 assists, giving him 102 points on the season.\n\nThis was an interesting tidbit on Kaliyev from [TSN's Bob McKenzie](https://www.tsn.ca/americans-set-to-dominate-first-round-of-the-nhl-draft-1.1323878):\n\n\u003e Inconsistency of effort has created a polarizing effect among scouts. In the TSN survey of 10 scouts, one had Kaliyev in the top 10 and another had him outside the top 40. The others had him spread out in between, totaling six votes in the first round and four in the second. No other prospect ranked in the first round has such a wide variance.\n\nNHL Central Scouting has Kaliyev ranked as the seventh-best North American skater, ahead of Caufield, Matthew Boldy and Peyton Krebs.\n\n### **Fit with Flyers**\n\nKaliyev has been a teammate of Flyers prospect Matthew Strome the past two seasons, so the club's development and scouting staff has likely seen a good bit of the winger.\n\nIt all comes down to what the Flyers think of Kaliyev (as well as the teams ahead of them).\n\nThere aren't a ton of flawless teenage prospects. Kaliyev will turn 18 years old next week and his game/effort in all three zones can be worked on over time.\n\nThere's no doubt a 51-goal scorer in just his second year of junior hockey is intriguing.","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T11:07:29.202039193Z","tags":null},"/reference/2019-NHL-Draft-Arthur-Kaliyev-The-Draft-Analyst":{"title":"","content":"\n# 2019 Draft Profile: RW Arthur Kaliyev : The Draft Analyst\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e One of the top wingers for the 2019 NHL Draft is shredding the OHL after an impressive rookie season a year ago.\n\n\n\nMetadata: \n\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](https://www.thedraftanalyst.com/2019-nhl-draft/2019-draft-profile-rw-arthur-kaliyev/)\n\n---\n**2019 NHL Draft**\n\n### Arthur Kaliyev\n\n### **Hamilton Bulldogs (OHL)**\n\n**Steve Kournianos**  |  10/08/2018 |  Nashville  |  \\[hupso\\]\n\nPhoto courtesy of Terry Wilson/OHL Images\n\n![](https://www.thedraftanalyst.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/arthur-kaliyev.jpg \"arthur-kaliyev\")\n\nProfile\n\n**Position:** Right Wing  \n**Shoots**: Left  \n**Height / Weight**: 6’1, 190 lbs  \n**Born:** June 26th, 2001 | Delray Beach, FL  \n**Nation:** United States\n\n\nScouting Report\n\nA goal-scoring winger with an excellent shot, Kaliyev was impressive last season as a rookie for the Hamilton Bulldogs, who won the OHL postseason title and nearly captured the Memorial Cup. His 30 goals were the most by any 16-year-old OHL’er since Alex Galchenyuk scored 31 for Sarnia in 2010-11. There are several aspects of Kaliyev’s game that stand out, namely his shot and ability to get open for clean looks at the net. He can finish in a variety of ways on both his forehand and backhand, and his one-timer from the circles is devastatingly accurate. Kaliyev’s ability to make quick bursts to the net from a static position creates a dilemma for defenders, since affording him too much room to shoot is equally as dangerous and playing him tight.\n\nAlthough Kaliyev has a strong upper body and powerful leg drive, he isn’t a physically-intimidating power forward. He uses his above-average speed and stickhandling to quickly counter up ice and maintain possession while being harassed, but you wouldn’t classify him as a crease crasher. Kaliyev spends a significant amount of time away from puck battles but can hold him own in the corners. He has soft hands and is a very good passer for a sniper, and Kaliyev appears to develop immediate chemistry with any center or linemate. Kaliyev likely isn’t the first player a coach will summon to kill a penalty or suffocate an opponent’s late-period rally, but his goal scoring ability for a teenager most certainly is elite.\n\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AAPG?src=hash\u0026amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003e#AAPG\u003c/a\u003e: C Alex Turcotte (Ranked No. 3) slows it down, jukes a few times before sending a perfect pass to LW Arthur Kaliyev (Ranked No. 18), who blisters one past Dustin Wolf. \u003ca href=\"https://t.co/1rgP26zdka\"\u003epic.twitter.com/1rgP26zdka\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u0026mdash; Steve Kournianos (@TheDraftAnalyst) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDraftAnalyst/status/1042571999883800576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eSeptember 20, 2018\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e \u003cscript async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T11:07:29.202039193Z","tags":null},"/reference/2019-NHL-Draft-Trevor-Zegras-Broad-Street-Hockey":{"title":"","content":"\n# 2019 NHL Draft Profile: Trevor Zegras, an American two-way forward with exceptional skating ability - Broad Street Hockey\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e Another American could crack the top 10.\n\nJohanGartner@JohanGartner\n\nMetadata: \n\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](https://www.broadstreethockey.com/2019/6/14/18661567/2019-nhl-draft-profile-trevor-zegras-a-two-way-forward-with-exceptional-skating-ability-american)\n\n---\nThe US National U18 team has a lot of really good prospects this year with the likes of [Jack Hughes](https://www.broadstreethockey.com/2019/6/12/18662032/2019-nhl-draft-profile-the-jack-hughes-and-kaapo-kakko-experience-is-upon-us-chuck-fletcher-flyers) and [Cole Caufield](https://www.broadstreethockey.com/2019/6/13/18677146/cole-caufield-draft-profile-stats-analysis-highlights-2019-nhl-draft) leading the way. Another really good prospect is the Bedford, NY native Trevor Zegras, who is projected to go early in the first round. Lets have a look and see if he could be someone the [Flyers](https://www.broadstreethockey.com/) might have interest in for this upcoming draft.\n\n#### **BSH 2019 Draft Profile: Trevor Zegras**\n\n**Position/Team:** C/W / US National U18 Team (Boston University commit)\n\n**2018-19 Statistics:** 26 G 61 A, in 60 GP\n\n**Size:** 6’0” 174 lbs\n\n#### **Pre-draft rankings**\n\n#5 [Hockeyprospect.com](https://www.eliteprospects.com/draft-center/2019/hockeyprospect.com)\n\n#8 [Future Considerations](https://www.eliteprospects.com/draft-center/2019/future-considerations)\n\n#10 [ISS hockey](https://www.eliteprospects.com/draft-center/2019/iss-hockey)\n\n#6 [McKeens hockey](https://www.eliteprospects.com/draft-center/2019/mckeen-s-hockey)\n\n#8 [Bob McKenzie](https://www.tsn.ca/hughes-kakko-in-tight-race-for-top-spot-1.1284470)\n\n## What’s there to like?\n\nWhere to start? Zegras is, first of all, a two-way forward with terrific skating ability. His mobility helps him dictate the play and his first step or two really sets him apart from other players. He loves to get under the skin of the opponents, and while he is mainly a playmaker, he has great hand-eye coordination and he is dangerous with deflections around the net — great hockey IQ.\n\nZegras takes pride in his defensive play and he uses the great speed of his to back-check and position himself where he is needed. He reads the plays really well and uses his active stick to create turnovers for counter-attacks. He has that ability to “always be on the right side of the puck”. He also relies on his smarts and speed all over the ice which always makes him a threat.\n\n## What’s not to like?\n\nZegras is a very well-rounded player who has the tools to become a very good NHL player, but he may need a year or two at Boston University to continue to work on his game and bulk up. He can be a perimeter player in the offensive zone at times, which is something that might fix itself when he gets stronger.\n\n## How would he fit in the Flyers’ system?\n\nFlyers are still working on signing Kevin Hayes to fill the second line center role, and if he signs the Flyers will be pretty stacked at center, especially with Morgan Frost in the pipeline as well. The good thing with Zegras is that he’s very flexible and can also play the wing, which is where he would most likely play if the Flyers drafted him.\n\n## Could the Flyers actually get him?\n\nZegras has been ranked anywhere between fifth and tenth depending on which ranking you check, and while there’s a possibility that he can fall all the way to 11th, I’d be surprised if he actually went outside of the top 10. His skill-set, along with him playing a “pro game” already, will help his chances of being drafted before it’s the Flyers turn to pick.\n\n## **Highlights**\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hH6XFpEhLr4?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T11:07:29.202039193Z","tags":null},"/reference/2019-NHL-Draft-Trevor-Zegras-Die-By-The-Blade":{"title":"","content":"\n# Draft Profile: Trevor Zegras - Die By The Blade\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e DBTB –\n \nThe Buffalo Sabres fanbase received a bit of disappointment at the NHL Draft Lottery, as they fell from #5 overall to #7.

But do not despair. The good news is that regardless of selection #5 or #7, they will add an excellent, high-end prospect to a fairly deep pool of young players.\n\nThe question is, who is that prospect?\n\nThere is a pile of players in the #3-#12 range that Jason Botterill could believably target given the Sabres need for more talent is pretty broad. All sorts of skill sets, from big playmaking centermen to small, quick goal scoring wings can be had at that #7 spot. I’ll take this opportunity to profile one here.\n\n**TREVOR ZEGRAS, C/LW, US DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM**\n\nA 5’11 1/2, 170# left-shot forward who is comfortable in the middle or on the wing, Zegras is a 2001-born player from downstate in Bedford, New York. An absolutely dynamite playmaking forward, he’s one of the top passers in the Draft Class. Most importantly, he can make elite plays at top speed. Has been very good all year, having scored the game-winner at the All-American Top Prospects game at the start of the season, and named the best player for the USA at the 5 Nations tournament in February. Notched an impressive 87 points in 60 games for the NTDP, shockingly only 4th on the NTDP in terms of points-per-game. Added 9 points in 5 games for the US in the Under-18 World Championships, despite coming off a shoulder injury in the preliminary games that kept him out of the first couple of round-robin games in that tournament. You can catch some of those highlights [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klPcg4P0m7w). That pass starting at 00:25 seconds is ridiculous.\n\nZegras possesses an uncanny knack for understanding space, creating it, and using it to his advantage. Misdirection is one of the most important weapons in his arsenal. Uses a variety of fakes, look offs, and changes of direction to distract opponents while putting sauce right on the tape of his linemates. Even on simple plays, he will throw in a small flourish – a change of pace, or a look-away, to freeze a defender for a half-second. He’s almost over-confident with the puck, as he’ll make behind-the-back passes, between his legs, no-look or try to saucer a pass through a half-dozen sticks when he sees an opening, and more often than not can put the puck into areas of the ice where only his teammates can reach it and turn it into a positive play. Very smart player who reads the defense instantly and finds a counter. Wizard-like hands are always in motion, and he’s equally good on his fore- or back-hand. Can dangle you to death with his incredible stick-handling.\n\nOne of the top skaters in the Class, he’s super quick and can explode out of a dead stop or changes in direction. He moves laterally with both ease and sharpness, and every stride seems designed to get him an advantage. Using his lateral mobility he can protect the puck by driving off defenders with speed or stepping around them. Will walk a defender to the outside, but Zegras prefers to threaten to go by a defender, get them on their heels, and then pull up to open up all kinds of space for himself to find a teammate. Thanks to his ridiculous handle and that skating, he can create clean zone entries at will. He’s particularly dangerous running the Power Play off the half-wall or at the point, with his NTDP coach pointing out that Zegras will be the best special teams player on whatever college team he goes to right out of the box (FYI – he’ll be at Boston University next season). High praise. You can check out some of his game (without Hughes) [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-jv-71HZLM).\n\nA feature to his game he shares with Eichel is his ability to think the game at high speed. He recognizes openings and defenses even when skating full steam and has the presence of mind always try making a play rather than play it safe.\n\nAll that said, he’s still got some blemishes to his game. Some will claim his gaudy numbers are a result of playing with Jack Hughes, but he drove his own line for more than a few games this season with Hughes out for the [World Juniors](https://www.sbnation.com/world-junior-hockey) and Turcotte out with injury. You might be able to say that Hughes’ gaudy stats might not be so impressive without Zegras feeding him. So he doesn’t need to play with great players, but his playmaking ability is best employed when he’s skating with other talented offensive players who know where to be on the ice. He isn’t a pure goal scorer, and can tend to overpass, leaving good scoring opportunities on the table in favor of the extra pass. He’ll need to pick his spots better as the competition improves. Looking to shoot more often would help, but he doesn’t have a big shot. In fact, his clapper is rather pedestrian, and although he’s very accurate in picking spots, neither his wrist shot nor his release are exceptional. Yet there’s an that innate sense of where the puck is, and he can find it in a crowd and lift it in a second with those butter-soft hands of his.\n\nZegras is dogged on the puck, which makes him a very dangerous forechecker and very willing backchecker. That said, he needs some work when defending off the puck, where he can get too eager to blow the zone and loses his guy. In a way, his defensive game resembles [Jeff Skinner](https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/297073/jeff-skinner). As a very accomplished puck possession player, he’s still very slight (6’0, 170#), so he can get pushed around pretty easily by bigger D-Men and forwards on the wall, and all the slick moves in the world won’t help when you’re pinned against the boards. So he’ll need to bulk up.\n\nZegras is a true game breaker. To me, the only player who has a better pure skill/speed combination in this Draft is Jack Hughes.\n\nThis is a FanPost written by a member of the community.

A member of the U.S. Under-18 team this year, he was part of an ensemble that could really make his offensive talents shine.\n\nBirthplace: **Bedford, NY, USA**  \nShoots: **Left**  \nPosition: **Centre/Wing**  \nHeight: **6’0”**  \nWeight: **168 lbs.**  \nTeam: **U.S. National Under-18 Team**\n\nWith the development program, he recorded 87 points in 60 games. That includes the team’s season in the USHL and contests against NCAA opponents. He also ended the year with nine points in five games at the World Under-18 Championship after missing the start of the tournament due to injury.\n\n ![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lp7AboLFKMatStlPitwaFPhx7rI=/0x0:549x318/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:549x318):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16234408/Screenshot_2019_05_10_Trevor_Zegras_at_eliteprospects_com.png) [EliteProspects](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/424453/trevor-zegras) \n\nWhat drives Zegras’s offensive success is his passing ability. The forward can make very difficult feeds look easy with his incredible vision. This talent makes him stand out from just about everyone else in this 2019 draft class. Rare are the games when he doesn’t impress one way or another with beautiful setups that would not be attempted by most players, or even occur to them.\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1yX9e9lZqHA?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nTake a look at this collection of plays made by the forward during the season. Zegras can use his backhand or forehand just as efficiently to set up a lot of different passes:\n\n-   Send the puck into space for a teammate to skate into;\n-   Use the boards to make indirect feeds halfway across the ice;\n-   Challenge the defence to create a pocket behind him in which to drop the puck, giving a teammate a chance to release from the slot;\n-   Do the same, but instead follow it by lobbing a pass to a teammate driving to the net;\n-   Slide the puck across the Royal Road (from one side of the ice to the other) through multiple sticks and skates, or;\n-   Spin on himself, or go through his legs inside the defensive coverage, to create passing lanes that weren’t previously there.\n\nHe shows a lot of diversity and creativity in his feeds. It allowed him to collect assists at a rhythm of better than one per game.\n\nZegras isn’t overly deceptive in his passes, contrary to many other playmakers who rely on manipulating the defence to open passing lanes. Instead, on top of his ingenuity he relies on his precision, his quick execution, and a stickhandling ability that rivals some of the best handlers in the draft to create many of his memorable plays.\n\nThose abilities also allow him to create chances for himself. He combines his shifty handling with heel pushes and turns within his wide-skating base to get inside the sticks and skates of defenders, constantly altering his stick grip to adjust his manoeuvres as opponent’s flail away at the puck.\n\nHere are a few sequences taken from both games versus the Russian Under-18 team that showcase Zegras’s hands.\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ngNGecoiZ_0?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nThe forward would be even more dangerous if he were to combine his attacks with the speed he possesses more often. As he consistently looks for passing targets, he slows down upon entering the offensive zone to look for support, exploiting the space between the defenders and the backcheck that was present at his level of play but won’t be as common at higher levels. By keeping his feet moving, using his high agility and finding a better mix between shooting and passing, Zegras would be just as dangerous with the puck on his stick against better opponents; no matter their defensive response, he would have an answer.\n\nIt’s a safe bet that he will learn to adapt as the challenges grow. He is incredibly skilled, and he could be counted on for different roles inside the U.S. National Team Development Program. He played both on the wing and at centre this season, and some of his best games came when he acted as the number-one center for the team during Jack Hughes’s absence for the [World Juniors](https://www.sbnation.com/world-junior-hockey). In that time, Zegras showed himself capable of playing a solid two-way game while retaining the full force of his offence.\n\nHe is capable of some physical play, but most of his defensive success comes from timely stick lifts while tracking the puck back to his zone, stealing it in between blue lines to immediately spring his team on offence.\n\nThis ability was reflected in his advanced stats. The forward was one of the most involved in the backcheck in all of the tracked data. Looking broadly at the numbers, his offensive prowess also led to him ranking at the top of many scoring categories, especially the ones related to playmaking: expected primary assists, shot assists, and one-timer assists.\n\n ![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DqK7pFrfXpgpnqn2SB_nZFg-nN4=/0x0:474x477/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:474x477):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16212369/1.png) \n\nFrom Mitch Brown’s [tracking project](https://www.patreon.com/user/overview?u=13951676)\n\nIn June, Zegras is projected to be selected in the top 10 of the draft by many scouting services. His passing talent makes him a very desirable target for a team looking for help on the power play or a setup man for their shooters. That being said, it’s also possible to see the USNTDP forward fall slightly outside the projections to an organization picking in the middle of the first round. His offensive game isn’t as well-rounded as some of the other top picks. His tendency to force passes might have some teams hesitate to call his name on the podium with an early pick.\n\n### Rankings (not all rankings are final)\n\nElite Prospects: **#21**  \nFuture Considerations: **#10**  \nHockey Prospect: **#10**  \nISS Hockey: **#9**  \nMcKeen’s Hockey: **#7**  \nMcKenzie/TSN: **#10**  \nNHL Central Scouting: **#6** (NA skaters)\n\nNext year, Zegras will join some of his supporting cast at Boston University, where he will get an occasion to be the main engine behind the team’s offence over a full season.

It’s what I’m really good at.\"\n\n**NHL player comparable:** Patrick Kane\n\n**Fit for Blackhawks:**\n\nTalk to any player on USA Hockey's National Team Development Program and they'll say Zegras was the most offensively gifted player of the group, which is saying a lot when you consider some of the names he's up against (Matthew Boldy, Cole Caufield, Jack Hughes, Alex Turcotte, to name a few).\n\nAt the NHL scouting combine, Zegras mentioned Kane several times as somebody he tries modeling his game after. The vision, the passing, the skating, the playmaking ability, the hockey IQ. He has it all offensively, and also doesn't get enough credit for his two-way game.\n\nZegras is somebody that has quickly been rising on draft boards, and it's because he has the potential to be a 90-point player in the NHL as a center. His name has been discussed by the Blackhawks at No. 3 and he's certainly a tempting option. Pair Zegras with Kane for the next decade and it's scary to think about the numbers the two could put up together.","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T11:07:29.202039193Z","tags":null},"/reference/2019-NHL-Draft-Trevor-Zegras-The-Draft-Analyst":{"title":"","content":"\n# 2019 Draft Profile: C Trevor Zegras : The Draft Analyst\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e 2019 NHL Draft\n\n\n\nMetadata: \n\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](https://www.thedraftanalyst.com/2019-nhl-draft/2019-draft-profile-c-trevor-zegras/)\n\n---\n**2019 NHL Draft**\n\n### Trevor Zegras\n\n### **U.S. U18 (NTDP)**\n\n**Steve Kournianos**  |  09/04/2018 |  Nashville  |  \\[hupso\\]\n\nPhoto courtesy of Rena Laverty\n\n![](https://www.thedraftanalyst.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Zegras-PIC-RENA-690x438.jpg \"Zegras PIC - RENA\")\n\nProfile\n\n**Position:** Center  \n**Shoots**: Left  \n**Height / Weight**: 6’0, 167 lbs  \n**Born:** March 20th, 2001 | Bedford, NY  \n**Nation:** United States\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"895\" height=\"503\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i7DwgB23YVk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n\nScouting Report\n\nSlick playmaking center with exceptional hockey sense who last year took over the NTDP’s top line after Jack Hughes and Alex Turcotte were promoted, and spent a good chunk of this season as a left wing. Zegras, who is committed to Boston University, is very dangerous with the puck and appears quite comfortable handling the responsibilities inherent in leading a talented squad’s offense. He is both crafty and fancy with the puck, and his passes almost always are on the tape with authority. Zegras’s pass accuracy remains consistent anywhere on the ice and he’s just as dangerous threading the needle while manning the half wall as he is in open ice. His ability to stickhandle while keeping his head up allows him to be the first to identify trailers or back-door cutters, and Zegras will use no-look centering passes on the power play to exploit an open passing lane. He’s also capable of tricking goalies with a hard, accurate shot that he can tuck under the bar from bad angles.\n\nZegras plays engaged with or without the puck and stays in motion in all three zones. He locks in on the puck regardless of where it is or whether or not he’s in control. Once he’s corralled it, Zegras can use a variety of stutter steps, gear changes or pirouettes to motor past, around or through traffic. His agility is outstanding, and he always seems to make the right reads when anticipating puck travel. Zegras is a strong, agile skater with very good straight-line speed who can stay low to the ice and maintain his elite balance as he zips through the neutral zone into opposing territory. His zone entries are surgical and designed to create time and space while maintaining possession. He is very good on faceoffs and will play physical along the boards. Zegras also has a mean streak and will get involved in scrums after the whistle.\n\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/U18?src=hash\u0026amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003e#U18\u003c/a\u003e: Happy Greek Easter to Trevor Zegras (Ranked No. 4) who flashes his skill with a neat pass to Cam York for an absolute laser.

The way in which he plays the game can immediately translate to the NHL and his terrific skill set will allow him to play the same style effectively against the best in the world.\n\nByfield’s case is different.\n\n### Beginning with the end in mind\n\nTo paraphrase the concept from _The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People_, we need to first understand what we are looking to get out of Byfield as an NHLer. By elaborating on our expectations and laying out the ideal outcome of his development process, we’ll have a better idea of what to prioritize.\n\n_Byfield’s best-case scenario in the NHL:_\n\n_1) Plays center_\n\n_2) Is a plus-value contributor both special teams_\n\n_3) Challenges for 20 minutes of ice time or more per game_\n\n_4) Scores at at a point-per-game pace once his game is at maturity_\n\n**If we were to throw Byfield into the fire at the start of the 2020-21 season, I anticipate that he will fail on all four counts.**\n\n### Show me how you move; tell me who you are\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hZNswSiGo94?rel=0\u0026amp;autoplay=0\u0026amp;showinfo=0\u0026amp;enablejsapi=0\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" gesture=\"media\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowautoplay=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"728\" height=\"409\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nAbove are Byfield’s first two shifts against the Niagara Ice Dogs on February 28, 2020 (video via InStat).\n\nThe sequences are fairly representative of Byfield’s overall game - his exceptional acceleration, strength and reach are on display, and he looks to be a factor all over the ice by hounding the puck aggressively.\n\n[![Future Watch: top ten 2020 draft prospects to watch at the Hlinka ...](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a7ac87b-ce5c-423c-b112-1e65d412c4fb_900x600.jpeg \"Future Watch: top ten 2020 draft prospects to watch at the Hlinka ...\")](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a7ac87b-ce5c-423c-b112-1e65d412c4fb_900x600.jpeg)\n\n_(Image: Terry Wilson, OHL Images)_\n\nBut once he gets a first touch on the puck, Byfield becomes his own worst enemy. His default skating stride is so hunched over that he needs to quickly reset his posture or risk losing the puck.\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46dec6ea-23f9-440b-bd46-0ea377209659_1024x576.jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46dec6ea-23f9-440b-bd46-0ea377209659_1024x576.jpeg)\n\n_(Image: NHL.com)_\n\nEvgeni Malkin is also a relatively hunched-over skater. But the Russian’s posture is more vertical, allowing him to keep his chin up and to go from free skating to puck handling with a minimum of fuss.\n\nMalkin’s shoulders are roughly in line with his knees, while Byfield’s shoulders are way in front, preventing him from rotation on-axis and shift laterally on his first touch.\n\nByfield’s postural issue flares up in other aspects of the game. Because his center of gravity is way forward, he has trouble loading his ankles and staying low through sharp turns. When he decides to cut back to shake off a defender, he straightens his legs, then quickly sinks his pelvis to dig into the ice and change direction. This is sub-optimal because an NHL caliber defenseman can either push him off the puck as he lifts his body or catch up to him and get a stick on the puck when he slows to a near-standstill in the middle of his turn.\n\nThe huge variability in his posture throughout a possession might even have positional implications. Give Byfield a quick pass on his backhand low in the defensive zone and see what happens: he stiffens up, his feet get stuck and he bobbles the puck. Hardly ideal for a center who is counted on to be flawless under pressure on breakouts.\n\n_Byfield’s worst-case scenario in the NHL:_\n\n_1) Plays left wing_\n\n_2) Is a middle-six forechecking specialist_\n\n_3) Plays 10-14 minutes per game, mostly in a shutdown and PK role_\n\n_4) Scores less than 30 points a year_\n\nWhat I’m describing above is still a tremendously valuable player. But it would a far cry from what Byfield’s capable of.\n\nAny NHL coach can do a job of channeling Byfield’s exceptional athleticism and hunger into hunting for loose pucks, taking the body and killing the opposing team’s offensive sequences.\n\nBut it will take some doing to help Byfield use his skills to create as opposed to destroy.\n\n### Embrace the chaos\n\nIn _The Art of Learning_, chess prodigy and martial arts champion Josh Waitzkin describes a particular challenge in his journey toward excellence:\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d4827fc-bb57-41cc-9744-1e2793c62bd5_550x205.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d4827fc-bb57-41cc-9744-1e2793c62bd5_550x205.png)[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F172c5608-5e2a-42a7-a9b5-e90958bbd973_534x328.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F172c5608-5e2a-42a7-a9b5-e90958bbd973_534x328.png)\n\nWaitzkin was never quite able to reconcile Dvoretsky and Razuvaev’s opposing views through the medium of chess. He was an attacking, daring, creative player who loved chaos and relished the process of finding solutions while his opponents sat stumped. But he was coached to play a structured, patient and _prophylactic_ game that wasn’t his. The outcome was predetermined. While Waitzkin was one of the best young players in the world, he never reached his potential as a senior and left chess to pursue an entirely different discipline.\n\nByfield is similar in the sense that he still plays a raw, instinctive, major-junior style of hockey as opposed to the fast but intensely structured version of the sport we see at the NHL level. He is at his best capitalizing on broken plays and sniffing for offense in the grey areas of the play rather than confined to a spot and told to wait his turn.\n\nFor him to be a star the game should flow freely like rapids. This is against the instincts of NHL coaches who seek to control the ebb and flow of the game and remove unexpected elements in the name of _consistency._\n\nTechnically Byfield will need to change _his_ game. But tactically he should be given a chance to change _the_ game_._\n\n### The Plan\n\nHere what I suggest:\n\n-   Byfield plays the entire next season in the OHL, aiming to be the best player on the best team in the country.\n    \n-   Whichever NHL team drafts him hires an player development analyst to break down every game and a player development coach to skate with him every week.\n    \n-   Byfield does not play an NHL game until his technical mastery matches that of Malkin at age 20, his first year in Pittsburgh (85 points, Rookie of the Year).\n    \n-   In his first NHL season his KPI is the number of possessions (touches) per 60 minutes of ice time - any defensive shortcomings will only be evaluated through the prism of “is he getting enough pucks?”\n    \n\nAfter that the rest will take care of itself.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T11:07:29.202039193Z","tags":null},"/reference/2020-NHL-Draft-Kasper-Smontival-The-Draft-Analyst":{"title":"","content":"\n# 2020 Draft: Top Prospects (Finland) : The Draft Analyst\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e Finland continues to produce premier NHL talent and the 2020 draft is no different.\n\nNortheastern Hockey Blog@NUHockeyBlog·February 12, 2022\n\nMetadata: \n\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](https://www.thedraftanalyst.com/2020-nhl-draft/2020-draft-top-prospects-finland/)\n\n---\nKasper Simontaival  \nRight Wing | Tappara U20, Nuorten SM-Liiga | 5’9, 177 | 1/11/02 | 41gp-20g-25a-45pts\n\n![](https://www.thedraftanalyst.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/DoRn6YyWsAEYPlK-1030x687.jpeg)\n\nSimontaival is pure offense.

He may not be the biggest kid on the ice, but Simontaival plays with intensity and is always looking to ram his offensive prowess right down his opponents’ throats. He spends a lot of time hovering near his own line in search of passes to pick off and turn into instant odd-man rushes.\n\nSimontaival has been a threat anywhere he’s played. From a top-six role in the Mestis to a first-line winger at the junior and international level, Simontaival has been able to use his quickness and attack-first mentality to generate multiple chances for himself or his linemates. Creating time and space is rarely a problem for someone with quick feet and advanced puck control like Simontaival, and his anticipation off the hop is quite high. In the last U18 5 Nations tournament, Simontaival played alongside a pair of physical forwards in 2021 draft prospect Samuel Helenius and winger Eetu Liukas, and he was actively engaged in boards battles and fought for pucks before he dished them out for one-timers or chances near the net.\n\nFrom a skating standpoint, Simontaival maintains a slightly hunched posture but can drop a quick first step. Having a low center of gravity might make one think his stride is short or choppy, but Simontaival’s stride is long and clean, and he can outpace pressure even from an equal starting point. He’s nimble and agile in tight spaces, and Simontaival is consistent in his ability to fake or juke an opponent to lean the wrong way and beat them to a spot for a clean look. He has very strong edges, and there are several stylistic comparisons to Chicago Blackhawks prospect Niklas Nordgren.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T11:07:29.202039193Z","tags":null},"/reference/2022-How-LAK-Creates-Offense-Hockey-Tactics-Newsletter":{"title":"","content":"\n# How LAK Creates Offense - by Jack Han\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e The ideas behind the Kings' leap\n\nJack Han\n\nMetadata: \n\n[[2022]]\n[[The Hockey Tactics Newsletter]]\n[Original Link](https://jhanhky.substack.com/p/how-lak-creates-offense?s=r)\n\n---\n# How LAK Creates Offense\n\n### The ideas behind the Kings' leap\n\n\u003ctable class=\"meta-author-wrap with-photo alternative-meta\"\u003e\u003ctbody\u003e\u003ctr class=\"meta-author-wrap-row\"\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"account-hover-wrapper\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"user-head \"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://substack.com/profile/9301555-jack-han\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"profile-img-wrap\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_90,h_90,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e719d6-ebcc-4423-b835-333080ea4499_558x575.jpeg\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd class=\"meta-author-contents\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"meta-right-column\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"meta-author\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"account-hover-wrapper\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://substack.com/profile/9301555-jack-han\"\u003eJack Han\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ctable class=\"post-meta   custom alternative-meta\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"\u003e\u003ctbody\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd class=\"post-meta-item audience-lock\"\u003e\u003csvg role=\"img\" width=\"15.058823529411764\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 17\" fill=\"none\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke=\"#000\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" style=\"height: 16px; width: 15.0588px;\"\u003e\u003cg\u003e\u003ctitle\u003e\u003c/title\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M5 6L5 3.9C5 2.57452 6.11929 1.5 7.5 1.5C8.88071 1.5 10 2.57452 10 3.9V6\" stroke=\"#262626\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M2 7.5C2 6.94772 2.44772 6.5 3 6.5H12C12.5523 6.5 13 6.94772 13 7.5V12.5C13 13.0523 12.5523 13.5 12 13.5H3C2.44771 13.5 2 13.0523 2 12.5V7.5Z\" fill=\"#262626\" stroke=\"#262626\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/g\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd class=\"post-meta-item post-date\" title=\"2022-02-26T14:27:41.545Z\"\u003e\u003ctime datetime=\"2022-02-26T14:27:41.545Z\"\u003eFeb 26\u003c/time\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/tbody\u003e\u003c/table\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003ctable class=\"post-meta  alternative-meta custom\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"\u003e\u003ctbody\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd class=\"post-meta-item icon\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003ca href=\"javascript:void(0)\"\u003e\u003csvg role=\"img\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 22 22\" fill=\"none\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke=\"#000\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"recommend-icon post-meta-icon\" style=\"width: 16px; height: 16px;\"\u003e\u003cg\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eShare\u003c/title\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M11.6247 14.5716C6.00049 14.5716 3.41296 16.7144 1 21.0001C1.00018 11.0001 5.37535 7.42871 11.6247 7.42871\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M11.6662 1L21 11L11.6662 21\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M11.6641 14.5723L11.6641 21.0008\" stroke-linecap=\"round\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M11.6602 1L11.6602 7.42857\" stroke-linecap=\"round\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/g\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/tbody\u003e\u003c/table\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/tbody\u003e\u003c/table\u003e\n\n[\n\n![Twitter avatar for @JhanHky](https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/JhanHky.jpg)Jack Han @JhanHky\n\nLAK is gonna be good this year...](https://twitter.com/JhanHky/status/1441036676885778433?s=20\u0026t=dKyh70tmSmXy1R4TAV3lwg)[\n\nSeptember 23rd 2021\n\n6 Retweets84 Likes\n\n](https://twitter.com/JhanHky/status/1441036676885778433?s=20\u0026t=dKyh70tmSmXy1R4TAV3lwg)\n\nHeading into the 2021-22 NHL season, I was more optimistic than most about the Los Angeles Kings’ playoff chances.\n\nMicah Blake McCurdy’s HockeyViz model had LAK as [a bubble playoff team with mediocre play-driving](https://hockeyviz.com/txt/preview2122).

F3 loiters high in the zone and shades toward the strong side.\n\nThe narrowness of LAK’s 2-1-2 deters against strong-side breakouts.

He dominated his second U16 season, posting 42 goals and 20 assists through just 22 games. He played his first two games of U20 hockey in the 2017-18 season, and went on to continue to impress in the 2018-19 season with the U20 team — he recorded nine goals and 18 assists in 27 games.\n\n![Kasper Simontaival Tappara](https://thehockeywriters.com/ezoimgfmt/s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Kasper-Simontaival-Tappara.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng%3Awebp%2Fngcb57)\n\nKasper Simontaival of Tappara (Arno Hamalainen\\_)\n\nDuring the 2018-19 season, Simontaival also began playing with Tappara of the Liiga, with two assists in five games. In his pre-draft season, he played most of his games with the U20 team, totaling 25 goals and 32 assists in 48 games, but he also got in four games in the Liiga.\n\nAt the 2020 NHL Entry Draft, the Los Angeles Kings [selected Simontaival in the third round](https://thehockeywriters.com/kings-2020-draft-successes/), 66th overall. He followed that up with another season withTappara of the Liiga, scoring three goals and four assists in 30 games. He also [played at the World Junior Championship](https://thehockeywriters.com/kings-prospects-impressing-2021-wjc-preliminaries/) (WJC) for Finland, scoring at a point-per-game pace — four goals and three assists in seven games.\n\nSo far this season, Simontaival has played 18 games with KalPa of the Liiga, recording three goals and five assists.\n\n## Scouting Report\n\nSimontaival is an elite playmaker. His hockey IQ and creativity are rare, and they have carried and will carry him throughout his career. He is a great option to have in a prospect pool, as his ability to make something out of nothing is unique.\n\nSimontaival doesn’t have many downfalls. Some have struggled with his skating, but it is not a big issue by any means, and he is not as stellar defensively — an issue that comes along with his size.\n\n## NHL Projection\n\nWhile it is tough to determine where Simontaival might end up in the Kings’ lineup given their plethora of forward prospects, he could be a top-six player one day. Most of the team’s forward depth lies at center, so there is room for him on the right side. Craig Button has compared Simontaival to [Cam Atkinson](https://thehockeywriters.com/docs/cam-atkinson/). They are both smaller players — Atkinson is 5-foot-8, 176 pounds — who are offensively gifted; in his career thus far, Atkinson has scored 230 goals and 208 assists in 672 games.\n\n![Cam Atkinson, Philadelphia Flyers](https://thehockeywriters.com/ezoimgfmt/s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cam-Atkinson-Flyers-2-1200x900.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb57)\n\nCam Atkinson, Philadelphia Flyers ([Amy Irvin](https://www.facebook.com/38Photography) / The Hockey Writers)\n\nWhile it might be a stretch to say Simontaival will have a similar career, if he continues to develop as he has been and raises his defensive game to an NHL level, he could be a big part of the Kings’ future.\n\n## Quotables\n\n\u003e _Prolific goal-scorer with quick, quality hands…his shot is a legit threat…can also deliver dangerous passes._\n\u003e \n\u003e [Draftin Europe](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/397010/kasper-simontaival)\n\n\u003e He may not be the biggest kid on the ice, but Simontaival plays with intensity and is always looking to ram his offensive prowess right down his opponents’ throats.

Byfield has a total of 14 minutes on the power play for his whole career. Byfield's averaging fourth line minutes. Expecting much more than fourth line production is lunacy. He's essentially playing the same number of minutes as guys like Kyle Clifford, Jordan Nolan, and Andy Andreoff in years past.  \n    \u003e   \n    \u003e Hell, in Kempe's rookie season, he scored two goals and six points in 25 games playing 12:00 per game, and two of Kempe's four assists came on the power play.

Give Kopi 9 minutes with Brown and whomever and zero PP time and watch him fail.  \n    \u003e   \n    \u003e At least AI is on line 3 and hopefully that helps. I think with Todd, you need to earn trust of everyone, to play top 6....Arty has really propelled himself and done that.  \n    \u003e But, he may be on a short leash. We'll see. I don't think ALL players that should get top 6 minutes, may never get that approval mark...or hit that threshold Todd  \n    \u003e wants / demands. It is a good thing to excel and earn it, like Moore has...but talented offensive players need to play in the top 6. I think Lias has the talent to,  \n    \u003e but may not get that chance, here. I know he's had some bleh games, but know he has the talent. If he plays bottom 6 and does not get any PP time, will be a shame.  \n    \u003e He's top 3 in the entire organization, 5 feet from the net. Won't get many chances there in the bottom 6. He and Grundstrom are the first to get scratched, no matter  \n    \u003e how hard they play, or the results.  \n    \u003e   \n    \u003e QB will be fine. He's skating well, getting off some good shots, making good plays...like the spin and sharp pass to Grundstrom, for that goal. Thank God  \n    \u003e Carl goes to the net like that, or that play never happens....as Brown does not go to the net like that, anymore. But, he's out there, to protect QB,  \n    \u003e as Rob said. ?\n    \n    [Peter James Bond II](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlmembers/peter-james-bond-ii.247251/), [Thursday at 6:02 PM](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlposts/183267772/ \"Permalink\") [Report](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlposts/183267772/report) [Bookmark](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlposts/183267772/bookmark)\n    \n    [683](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlthreads/quinton-byfield-2nd-overall-2020-draft-discussion-part-ii.2817801/page-28#post-183267772 \"Permalink\") [Unlike](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlposts/183267772/like) [\\+ Multi-Quote](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlthreads/quinton-byfield-2nd-overall-2020-draft-discussion-part-ii.2817801/reply?quote=183267772 \"Toggle Multi-Quote\") [Reply](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlthreads/quinton-byfield-2nd-overall-2020-draft-discussion-part-ii.2817801/reply?quote=183267772 \"Reply, quoting this message\")\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T11:07:29.202039193Z","tags":null},"/reference/Kings-Arvidsson-Finds-a-Home-on-the-Second-Line":{"title":"","content":"\n# Kings' Arvidsson Finds a Home on the Second Line\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e Los Angeles Kings forward Viktor Arvidsson has found his feet in Los Angeles, especially after his move onto the second line.\n\nAustin Stanovich\n\nMetadata: \n\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](https://thehockeywriters.com/kings-arvidsson-finds-home-second-line/)\n\n---\n# Kings’ Arvidsson Finds a Home on the Second Line\n\nFebruary 9, 2022 by [Austin Stanovich](https://thehockeywriters.com/author/astanovich/ \"View all posts by Austin Stanovich\")\n\n-   [](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthehockeywriters.com%2Fkings-arvidsson-finds-home-second-line%2F \"Share this post!\")\n-   [](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthehockeywriters.com%2Fkings-arvidsson-finds-home-second-line%2F\u0026text=Last summer, Los Angeles Kings general manager Rob Blake made a series of moves intended to take the team from rebuilding bottom-feeders to playoff hopefuls.

The first of those moves was trading a 2021 second-round pick and a 2022 third-round pick to the Nashville Predators [in exchange for Viktor Arvidsson.](https://www.nhl.com/news/viktor-arvidsson-nashville-los-angeles-trade/c-325543696) The initial plan was for Arvidsson to come in and be the goal-scoring winger [Anze Kopitar](https://thehockeywriters.com/docs/anze-kopitar/) has been missing for the last few seasons. Unfortunately, that didn’t happen, but Arvidsson has still found success with the team and is now one of their best offensive weapons.\n\n## Arvidsson on the First Line\n\nAt the beginning of this season, Arvidsson played with Kopitar on the first line, with Dustin Brown and Adrian Kempe rotating out as his wing partners. The initial line of Arvidsson-Kopitar-Brown was okay — it posted solid possession numbers and marginally outscored opponents. Conceptually, the line made sense; Brown would provide physicality and puck retrieval, Arvidsson could provide speed and finishing, while Kopitar was the dominant, two-way playmaker he’s always been. Unfortunately, Arvidsson struggled to finish, couldn’t find chemistry with Kopitar, and Brown was clearly not a first-line player anymore. The line wasn’t a liability by any means, but they were not good enough for a first line. if(typeof \\_\\_ez\\_fad\\_position!='undefined'){\\_\\_ez\\_fad\\_position('div-gpt-ad-thehockeywriters\\_com-medrectangle-3-0')};\n\n![Viktor Arvidsson Los Angeles Kings](https://thehockeywriters.com/ezoimgfmt/s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Viktor-Arvidsson-Kings-2.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng%3Awebp%2Fngcb57)\n\nViktor Arvidsson, Los Angeles Kings ([Jess Starr](https://www.instagram.com/jmstarr_/)/The Hockey Writers)\n\nThe team didn’t give up on Arvidsson on the top line right away, though. They swapped Brown out for Kempe, hoping the two Swedes could find chemistry and jump-start the line. It was successful in that it improved the line’s possession numbers, but the line struggled to score, and couldn’t keep pucks out of their own net. The line would only score once and would concede five before coach Todd McLellan decided to shake things up.\n\n**Related: [Kings Begin Summer Shopping With Arvidsson Trade](https://thehockeywriters.com/kings-arvidsson-trade-positives/)**\n\nHindsight being 20/20, Kempe and Arvidsson were always a poor fit as wing partners. Both players look to generate offense in a similar fashion, using their speed to back defenders off while producing a very high shot volume. The line’s combination of size, speed, and skill allowed them to dominate possession numbers and even produce better chances than their opponents, but they were ultimately one-dimensional and couldn’t consistently produce real offense. if(typeof \\_\\_ez\\_fad\\_position!='undefined'){\\_\\_ez\\_fad\\_position('div-gpt-ad-thehockeywriters\\_com-box-4-0')};\n\n## if(typeof \\_\\_ez\\_fad\\_position!='undefined'){\\_\\_ez\\_fad\\_position('div-gpt-ad-thehockeywriters\\_com-medrectangle-4-0')};Arvidsson on the Second Line\n\nA great safety net for players who are struggling on the Kings this season has been putting them with Phillip Danault, as the second-line center has seemingly improved every winger who has been placed with him. [Arvidsson has been no different](https://mayorsmanor.com/2021/11/projected-lineup-la-kings-vs-ottawa-senators-in-game-20/), finding success with both Alex Iafallo and Trevor Moore playing opposite of him. The Moore-Danault-Arvidsson line has been particularly impressive, with one of the best goal percentages in the NHL, outscoring opponents 12-2. They’ve also been dominant in possession, controlling over 60 percent of both shot attempts and shots on net. The newly crowned “Nice Line” was pivotal in a great month of January where the team went 8-4-2, and Arvidsson is a key member of their success.\n\n![Viktor Arvidsson Los Angeles Kings](https://thehockeywriters.com/ezoimgfmt/s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Viktor-Arvidsson-Kings-1200x800.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb57)\n\nViktor Arvidsson, Los Angeles Kings ([Jess Starr](https://www.instagram.com/jmstarr_/)/The Hockey Writers)\n\nA very hard worker, much like Danault and Moore, Arvidsson injects a dose of skill and speed into the line. A good presence on the forecheck, a high-volume shooter, and one of the league’s best at creating off the rush, he complements his two linemates perfectly. Danault is a play driver who dominates in the corners and along the wall, while [Moore is a Swiss Army knife](https://hockeyroyalty.com/2022/01/20/la-kings-the-emergence-of-trevor-moore-and-why-its-good-for-hockey-in-california/) who can perform any role asked of him.\n\nIt’s on the rush where Arvidsson does the most damage — according to AllThreeZones.com, only Johnny Gaudreau has generated more offense off the rush than Arvidsson this season. According to the same website, he’s also generating the most shots per 60 minutes, with a staggering 22.81 shots per 60. His finishing let him down massively at the beginning of the season, scoring just twice in his first 10 games, and just six times in his first 25 games. He’s starting to find his scoring touch, though, with seven goals in his last 14 games; we’re beginning to see shades of the two-time 30-goal scorer he once was.\n\nWhile it’s very unlikely he’s able to break the 30-goal mark again this season, especially considering he’s missed seven games already, I do expect him to continue this upward trajectory. His play earlier in the season deserved more goals and he’s now being rewarded for solid play. It will be interesting to see how long the Moore-Danault-Arvidsson line can keep up this level of dominance, but I think regardless of what happens with that line we can expect this version of Arvidsson to stay, if not improve.if(typeof \\_\\_ez\\_fad\\_position!='undefined'){\\_\\_ez\\_fad\\_position('div-gpt-ad-thehockeywriters\\_com-banner-1-0')};\n\n## A Smart Acquisition\n\nThe [NHL expansion draft last](https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/31858223/seattle-kraken-expansion-draft-live-results-players-selected-30-nhl-teams) summer created a unique opportunity for Blake to go out and grab a player for much cheaper than they should have been, and he capitalized. Under normal circumstances, a player with Arvidsson’s pedigree and underlying numbers, which showed a bounce-back was inevitable, would never have been traded for so little. He’s already surpassed his point total from last season and is only getting better as the season progresses. This was always a perfect low-risk, high-reward move for the Kings, and they’re very close to cashing in on the high-reward portion of the deal.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T11:07:29.202039193Z","tags":null},"/reference/Kings-Select-Kasper-Simontaival-Round-3-Pick-66-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"","content":"\n# Kings Select Kasper Simontaival (Round 3, Pick 66) - LA Kings Insider\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e The LA Kings have selected forward Kasper Simontaival with the 66th overall pick in the 2020 NHL Draft!

I wouldn’t call him a top playmaker, but he can find the seams on the ice well and flash high-end vision. His shot is more impressive to me than his passing, although I think both are certainly strong points. The main areas of concern for Simontaival are his small frame and just fine skating. I think his edgework is good and he’s shifty in small spaces, but he lacks any real speed and his stride breaks down more than you’d like for a small forward. He does compete well and is good around the net, but he isn’t that strong in puck battles or defensively.\n\n**[Via ESPN’s Chris Peters](https://www.espn.com/nhl/insider/story/_/id/29994322/2020-nhl-draft-rankings-final-top-100-prospects-class-chris-peters-plus-position-rankings)**  \nHe’s small but quick with excellent hands and a desire to create. Simontaival put up big numbers in Finland’s top junior league this season but couldn’t quite find his game against pros. There’s a lot of room for him to improve certain elements of his game, but I think his speed helps lessen any size worries.\n\n**[Elite Prospects 2020 Draft Guide](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/397010/kasper-simontaival)**  \nHe’s a true dual-threat winger with two-way upside, a sturdy frame, and the type of competitiveness necessary to hang in there as a vertically-challenged forward.

The [Lightning](https://theathletic.com/team/lightning/) have been a popular pick to win it all for years, but it took them five years since their last Stanley Cup Final berth to make it back. Few would have picked the [Stars](https://theathletic.com/team/stars/) this season, especially with their starting goaltender injured, but they found a way and now they’re three wins away from being champions.\n\nBuilding a roster to win it all isn’t easy, and even building a good team often isn’t enough in a sport with as much chaotic energy as hockey. But there are lessons to be learned from past winners; guidelines for how a team’s roster should be made up. Stylistically they all differ, but from a total value perspective, there are similar elements that can be looked upon as goals for roster-building. The last two Cup winners were led by an elite centre worth roughly three wins, but there’s a big difference between the way Ryan O’Reilly and [Nicklas Backstrom](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/capitals/nicklas-backstrom/) play, for example.\n\nAn elite top line centre being a prerequisite to winning the Stanley Cup shouldn’t come as a huge surprise; it’s a talking point that’s been championed for a long time. Over the past decade only one team, the 2011 [Bruins](https://theathletic.com/team/bruins/), won the Stanley Cup without a projected top line centre. [David Krejci](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/bruins/david-krejci/) was just on the cusp and [Patrice Bergeron](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/bruins/patrice-bergeron/) hadn’t hit his full stride yet as one of the game’s best two-way players. However, both played at that level come playoff time. \n\nOn average, the top centre on a Stanley Cup winning team is worth around 3.8 wins in the regular season; that’s by far the most important piece for a contender. But there’s more to the puzzle than just one player.\n\nThis isn’t a new study by any means, it’s one I did for [The Hockey News](https://www.si.com/hockey/news/eight-simple-rules-for-building-a-stanley-cup-contender) four years ago and one that Cam Lawrence – who works for the [Florida Panthers](https://theathletic.com/team/fla-panthers/) – [also did](https://canucksarmy.com/2015/08/21/building-a-contender-part-5-conclusion/), but it’s worth diving into it again with more data. This time around, I’m armed with projected values for each player at the time of the playoffs to better assess their true talent level, plus a couple extra seasons of results. I’ll also be looking at each position on the depth chart, not just the core players, to give a better idea of where certain players should fit on a Cup-contending roster.\n\nIt’s not just the average that matters, though. It would be foolish to treat 3.8 wins for a top line centre as a “you must be this tall to ride” measuring stick – it’s a range. No team is ever average or above relative to a Cup winner at every position on the roster and having a range of acceptable values helps illustrate where a player falls and how far off a team is. It’s even OK to be below average in a few areas. The key is to make up ground elsewhere and build a roster with as few concessions as possible.\n\nIt should be noted as well that rather than averaging out by left and right wingers or defencemen, the best wingers or defencemen on a given line or pair were grouped together. While most Cup winners are predominantly stronger on the right side, that distinction probably doesn’t matter and this properly groups [Alex Ovechkin](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/capitals/alex-ovechkin/) with [Patrick Kane](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/blackhawks/patrick-kane/) and [John Carlson](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/capitals/john-carlson/) with [Duncan Keith](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/oilers/duncan-keith/), rather than with [Brandon Saad](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/blues/brandon-saad/) and [Michal Kempny](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/capitals/michal-kempny/), respectively. \n\nHere’s how the roster for a Stanley Cup winner looks, with an acceptable range of one standard deviation on either side.\n\n[![](https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2020/09/18144149/Screen-Shot-2020-09-18-at-2.42.23-PM.png)](https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2020/09/18144149/Screen-Shot-2020-09-18-at-2.42.23-PM.png)\n\nBased on the above chart, a team that fancies itself a contender is looking at the following checklist in terms of top of the lineup players.\n\n-   Elite first-line centre that’s among the very best players in the world.\n-   Elite first-line winger to support the elite centre.\n-   Two other top-line wingers on each of the top two lines.\n-   Top-line centre to play behind the elite centre. \n-   Two more top-six forwards for depth in the middle six.\n-   Elite No. 1 defenceman.\n-   A second No. 1 defenceman to play behind him. \n-   A top pairing defenceman to help anchor a strong second pair with the No. 2. \n-   Another top-pairing calibre defender to crush soft minutes on the third pair. \n-   A top 10 calibre starting goaltender.\n\nAnd that’s without mentioning two capable third-liners, another steady top four defenceman who can play on the top pair, and making sure no one on the fourth line or bottom pair is replacement level. It’s a tall order, especially making sure all the pieces fit together beyond numbers on a page. Chemistry matters.\n\nSo while that’s a handy checklist under ideal circumstances, there’s no hard-and-fast rule. That’s where the ranges come in. A team can get away with not meeting the criteria in one area if they surpass it elsewhere and certain areas are more negotiable than others. Only the elite center (9/10), elite defenceman (officially 8/10, but one of the misses is because Keith had an off year), and top pairing defenceman on the second pair (9/10) were found on 80 percent of the champions. Every other archetype on the checklist was there six out of 10 times.\n\nA top 10 goalie would be great, but as long as he’s an above average starter it’s probably fine, especially with a strong defence in front of him. Having an elite winger on the top line is ideal, but a team can probably get away with someone that’s a shade below if they have strong depth in the middle six. \n\nThere’s other lessons that can be gleaned from this too, and those are the areas that are probably _not_ worth sweating over. Three areas come to mind: third-line center, top pair next to the star and the fourth line.\n\nDepth down the middle is crucial to building a Cup contender, but on average 86 percent of the value is confined to the top two centres. The past 10 Cup winners have been built off strong duos (O’Reilly/Schenn, Backstrom/Kuznetsov, Crosby/Malkin, Kopitar/Carter, Krejci/Bergeron). Meanwhile, only [Tyler Bozak](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/blues/tyler-bozak/), [Nick Bonino](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/sharks/nick-bonino/) and [Mike Richards](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/capitals/mike-richards/) were considered to be centres above third-line calibre. The same goes for the wingers. Only 14 out of 30 third-liners were top six calibre.\n\nThere’s also the idea that a team’s cornerstone defenceman needs to play with another top pairing guy to maximize the top pair. But the beauty of most elite defencemen is they generally don’t need much help. We’re seeing that play out this year with [Victor Hedman](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/lightning/victor-hedman/) lugging around [Zach Bogosian](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/lightning/zach-bogosian/) or [Luke Schenn](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/canucks/luke-schenn/), but there’s some historical precedent to it. Sure there’s Keith with [Brent Seabrook](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/lightning/brent-seabrook/), but there’s also been [Zdeno Chara](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/islanders/zdeno-chara/) with [Dennis Seidenberg](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/islanders/dennis-seidenberg/), [Drew Doughty](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/kings/drew-doughty/) with [Willie Mitchell](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/fla-panthers/willie-mitchell/), John Carlson with Michal Kempny and [Alex Pietrangelo](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/golden-knights/alex-pietrangelo/) with [Joel Edmundson](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/canadiens/joel-edmundson/). Good, steady players that coaches can trust in tough minutes – but they’re players that really aren’t that difficult to find.\n\nLastly, the average fourth line for a Cup contender looks like … an average fourth line. There’s nothing special here aside from a few years of [Matt Cullen](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/penguins/matt-cullen/) being awesome. If there’s a place to cut corners on a roster it’s here, especially since teams can ramp up the ice time of the top six in the playoffs.\n\nBut there’s an even more important reason the fourth lines don’t matter nearly as much here, and it’s because of the other part of this average Cup contender equation: how the players actually perform in the playoffs. That detail is often underreported on the analytics side when it comes to investigating a player’s total value, but it’s an important one – especially in comparison to how those players are projected to perform.\n\nWhen the average first-line Cup-winning centre is projected to be worth 3.8 wins, that’s under the expectation of playing against an average team under average circumstances. But the playoffs are not that. They’re a gruelling grind against increasingly difficult competition where matchups become even more important in a seven-game series.\n\nSo top line centres on Cup winners don’t provide as much value as projected. In fact, they have the largest drop-off of any position on the depth chart, losing 0.9 wins of value. That’s a matter of goals being a lot harder to come by in the postseason and facing the toughest matchups night after night. \n\nThe lessened offence means most of the forwards lose value on average (about 0.3 wins worth) with none being hit harder than the fourth line. The trio already carries little value to begin with, and loses another 1.8 on top of that, meaning in the playoffs they provide sub-replacement level value on average. Again, it’s the matchups taking over as there are fewer places to hide a fourth line. With the top line and fourth line losing lots of value, the middle six on a Cup-winning team generally does pick up the slack; that’s possibly where the idea that a strong third-line centre is crucial to a championship-calibre team comes in. They get the second largest bump among forwards, suggesting it’s not that a team necessarily needs a strong third-line centre, but they do need one that can elevate his game in the playoffs. Though the Bruins didn’t win last year, [Charlie Coyle](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/bruins/charlie-coyle/)’s playoff excellence definitely comes to mind.\n\nAs for the defence, they’re dead even with projections on aggregate, but the value distribution changes dramatically. Most third pairs are a little better, while those usually strong second pairs really struggle relative to expectations on Cup-winning teams. Perhaps that’s due to them being used more often as shutdown pairs, but it’s certainly an interesting trend. \n\nThe top pair is where the biggest positive change comes from among a champion’s skaters. If you’re wondering why talking heads always wax poetic about the importance of having an elite No. 1 defender, it’s because of how they’ve generally elevated their game in the playoffs, becoming the most important skaters on the team when it matters most. On average, a team’s best defenceman has been 0.8 wins better in the playoffs, bringing their total value up to 3.3 wins on average (while top line centres drop to 2.9 wins). Pietrangelo, Carlson, Letang, Keith, Doughty, Chara all brought the heat in their Cup-winning seasons and unsurprisingly it’s Hedman and [Miro Heiskanen](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/stars/miro-heiskanen/) putting in work to lead Tampa Bay and Dallas to the final. Those types of defenders are the key to a lengthy playoff run.\n\nBut the most important player of all when it comes to the playoffs is, of course, the goalie, projected to be worth three wins, but earning closer to five on an average Cup winner.\n\n[![](https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2020/09/18152436/Screen-Shot-2020-09-18-at-3.23.50-PM.png)](https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2020/09/18152436/Screen-Shot-2020-09-18-at-3.23.50-PM.png)\n\nOn average, goalies on Cup-winning teams are _two_ _wins_ _better_ than projected. That says it all about building a Stanley Cup winning roster. A team can have the best group of skaters, but without a hot goalie, it’s tough to go very far. \n\nAs Mike Tyson once said, “everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.” In hockey that equates to the minute something goes wrong in between the pipes, essentially rendering any Cup checklist moot.\n\nGoaltending is by far the most important piece to any Cup-winning team and it’s no surprise that both [Andrei Vasilevskiy](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/lightning/andrei-vasilevskiy/) and [Anton Khudobin](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/stars/anton-khudobin/) have been very strong en route to their team’s respective final’s berth. The issue when it comes to goaltending is that it’s notoriously hockey’s most volatile position. That’s part of the chaos that’s bred in the postseason and it was only a year ago that Vasilevskiy was a big part of Tampa Bay’s demise, posting a grizzly .856 save percentage in the team’s four-game, first-round defeat. He’s turned the tables in these playoffs with a .931 save percentage and unsurprisingly, the team has followed.\n\nThese aren’t a strict set of rules, but they can be seen as guidelines based on past Cup winners. Any team checking a majority of the boxes should be well on their way to contending and with a little postseason luck on their side might hoist the Stanley Cup.\n\n_(Photo: Dave Sandford / NHLI via Getty Images)_\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T11:07:29.202039193Z","tags":null},"/reference/Stanley-Cup-contender-checklist-The-Athletic":{"title":"","content":"\n# Stanley Cup contender checklist: How does each playoff team stack up? – The Athletic\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e Referencing the Cup Checklist, we looked at what each NHL playoff team already has and what it still might need to be considered Cup-worthy.\n\nShayna Goldman, Dom Luszczyszyn\n\nMetadata: \nBoston Bruins,Tampa Bay Lightning,Toronto Maple Leafs,Florida Panthers,Carolina Hurricanes,New York Rangers,Pittsburgh Penguins,Washington Capitals,Dallas Stars,Colorado Avalanche,St. Louis Blues,Nashville Predators,Minnesota Wild,Calgary Flames,Edmonton Oilers,Los Angeles Kings,Vancouver Canucks,Vegas Golden Knights,NHL\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](https://theathletic.com/3186979/2022/03/16/stanley-cup-contender-checklist-how-does-each-playoff-team-stack-up/)\n\n---\n# \n\nStanley Cup contender checklist: How does each playoff team stack up?\n\n![DENVER, COLORADO - MARCH 13: Nazem Kadri #91 of the Colorado Avalanche skates against Trevor Lewis #22 of the Calgary Flames at Ball Arena on March 13, 2022 in Denver, Colorado.

Stylistically, there isn’t one right answer for how to build a team, as long as it’s constructed with good players that fit properly throughout the lineup.\n\nThe Stanley Cup recipe is a difficult one to master as there are different ways to interpret it, but looking at how it was cooked before offers some helpful patterns toward success. Based on a decade of championship meals from the 2010s, there are 10 common elements to look for when crafting a team worthy of contending. Every fine meal starts with a grocery list, and this one — the [Cup Checklist](https://theathletic.com/2077279/2020/09/21/cup-checklist-analyzing-the-rosters-from-the-last-decade-of-champions/) — is no different.\n\n-   Elite first-line center that’s among the very best players in the world.\n-   Elite first-line winger to support the elite center.\n-   Two other top-line wingers on each of the top two lines.\n-   Top-line center to play behind the elite center. \n-   Two more top-six forwards for depth in the middle six.\n-   Elite No. 1 defenseman.\n-   A second No. 1 defenseman to play behind him. \n-   A top-pairing defenseman to help anchor a strong second pair with the No. 2. \n-   Another top-pairing caliber defender to crush soft minutes on the third pair. \n-   A top-10 caliber starting goaltender.\n\nIt’s possible to make a great-tasting meal that’s Cup-worthy without every ingredient accounted for, but the best meals are the ones that have as many ingredients accounted for as possible. Not every team has it all, but the ones that have the most are the ones that are usually closest to competing for the Stanley Cup.\n\nSo does your team’s meal belong on Master Chef or Kitchen Nightmares? That’s the question teams have to be asking themselves going into the trade deadline because it’s the last chance to go to the market and improve their dish with a secret ingredient or two before it heads to the oven.\n\nEvery team will find themselves shopping over the next week with one common goal — to make the best meal possible. Some teams only need a finishing touch, some teams need spices to kick the flavor up a notch, and some teams are missing an entire side dish.\n\n\n### **Cup Checklist legend**\n\n_Gold Checkmark: Exceeds expectations, above acceptable range from average Cup-winner_ \n\n_Black Checkmark: Right on target, in line with average Cup-winner_\n\n_Grey Checkmark: Passable, below average relative to average Cup-winner_\n\n_Red X: A hole in the lineup, below acceptable range from average Cup-winner_\n\n\n\n### **Los Angeles**\n\n[![](https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/03/15153734/Screen-Shot-2022-03-15-at-3.33.51-PM.png)](https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/03/15153734/Screen-Shot-2022-03-15-at-3.33.51-PM.png)\n\nThe [Kings](https://theathletic.com/team/kings/) are one of this year’s biggest surprises and the model is still very steadfast that what we’re seeing out of them is a mirage. The depth remains a question mark across the board and the elite core simply isn’t what it needs to be to contend. It’s enough to be a playoff team — especially with the way [Viktor Arvidsson](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/kings/viktor-arvidsson/) and [Drew Doughty](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/kings/drew-doughty/) have performed this year — but contending is a whole other ball game. Los Angeles isn’t ready for that yet. It might be worth pursuing some players with term — Jakob Chychrun comes to mind — but rentals should be out of the question. Either way, there shouldn’t be pressure to make a splash for this year’s playoffs.","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T11:07:29.202039193Z","tags":null}}
