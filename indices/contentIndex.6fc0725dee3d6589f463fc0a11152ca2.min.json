The LA Kings host the Vegas Golden Knights this evening to open up a short, two-game homestand to begin the season.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n- Projected third line: [[Alex Iafallo]] – [[Quinton Byfield]] – [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- Projected fourth line: [[Carl Grundstrom]] – [[Blake Lizotte]] – [[Arthur Kaliyev]]\n- Projected starting goaltender: [[Jonathan Quick]]\n\n\u003e I think when those don’t exist, you should probably worry a little bit. The palms get sweaty, you get a little bit excited. The staff, and I don’t just mean the coaching staff, the whole organizatio, should have jitters, they should be excited. We’ve put a month’s worth of work into opening night and we want to perform well. It’s always an interesting night. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e I think you just get the excitement of the season starting. Sometimes you might feel a bit nervous, but I think that’s good. It means you’re focused, it means you’re ready, it means you’re excited. It’s all good stuff. -- [[Alex Edler]]\n\n\u003e There’s always excitement, a little bit nervous in a good way. With a new team, there’s even a little bit more excitement and I’m just ready to go. With how the summer’s been, now here we are for a new season. It goes fast and I can’t wait to get started in the new rink, with my new team. -- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n\u003e Puck protection is probably number one, the ability to protect in tight, tight areas, he’s got really good hockey vision there and IQ, making plays. He battles to protect pucks and he gives us an element that I’m not sure we have a whole bunch in this organization. He’s a natural scorer, a lot of high-end offense and he’s very creative in the types of plays he wants to make. -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\u003e It’s coming together. Having a couple of weeks now and few games under our belt, that always helps and I think it’s coming along nicely. Are we fully there yet, probably not, but we’re still learning about each other on the go and just trying to create and go from there. -- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\n\u003e I felt on the ice that we took a step closer to where we want to be from Game 1 to the last game on Saturday. It was nice. For me to get comortable with the systems, knowing what to do and with those two guys, learning how they play and just reading the game. I felt very confident on Saturday so I’m hoping for that tonight as well. -- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n### [[Rob Blake]]\n\u003e I think the way you look at it, if you’re in our 12 \\[forwards] or our starting six we would project upstairs, regardless of your situation in the CBA we’re making spot. Now, you have the ability to carry three extra players, whether it’s two forwards or two D, then we have to look a little bit at waivers and understand that we want to protect some of the assets and the players. There’s a few players that didn’t need waivers to go down but we also felt that they can still build their games \\[in the AHL]. Knock on wood, today is as healthy as we’ve been in a full year, on Sunday I think we saw every player back. We know we’re going to deal with injuries and we’re going to need some added depth down there that can come in and play.\n\n\u003e We go over that constantly. If we’re in a healthy situation, we had players that had to be exposed to waivers and you go over when to put them on and when not to. You put them on early, but then a team could claim them and look at them, you put them on later, it allows teams that have had injuries \\[a chance]. Most of our situations, we wanted to get through our camp, make sure we were healthy coming into Sunday, then we’d sit down, discuss the lineup and then players that were waiver eligible and those that weren’t and go forward from there. Losing players on waivers, it’s part of the process, I think we have to understand that. When you start getting better and you have more quality players, you’ll be in those situations.\n\n\u003e It was \\[a tough conversation] with those players. I still think those players can learn in the American League. Eventually, if a player is good enough, he’s an everyday NHL player, there will come a point where he’s not going to learn more in the American League, but I still think we can get some things accomplished with these players and that was our message. You did a terrific job, you’ve done everything we’ve asked you to do so far, we still think you can get better and we’re going to need you down the stretch.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/10-13-Preview-Clarke-Debut-Expected-+-Arvidsson-out-19-55-13-Line-Being-First-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"10-13 Preview - Clarke Debut Expected + Arvidsson out, 19-55-13 Line, Being First - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# 10-13 Preview - Clarke Debut Expected + Arvidsson out, 19-55-13 Line, Being First - LA Kings Insider\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-13 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [10-13 Preview - Clarke Debut Expected + Arvidsson out, 19-55-13 Line, Being First - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/13/10-13-preview-clarke-debut-expected-arvidsson-out-19-55-13-line-being-first/)\n2022-10-13 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[10-13 Preview - Clarke Debut Expected + Arvidsson out, 19-55-13 Line, Being First - LA Kings Insider]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n- [[Jonathan Quick]]\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n- [[Brendan Lemieux]]\n- [[Carl Grundstrom]]\n- [[Alex Iafallo]]\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings conclude a short, two-game homestand tonight, with the Seattle Kraken in town for the first time this season.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e This is the moment I’ve dreamed of for so long. I’ve been watching the NHL for my entire life and now that I’m officially going to be in it, it’s kind of crazy to think about. This is going to be something I’ll never forget, it’ll be pretty cool. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e It wasn’t planned that way, but I think there’s something that can help him in that situation. He’s been around for long enough now, throughout the exhibition season, to see how daily rhythm occurs, prepping for a game. It does change when it gets to the regular season a little bit, but the general prep is the same. The quality of the opponent is much higher and that will be the biggest change for him. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e [[Trent Yawney|Yawns]] and I were just talking about it, there’s enough that’s going on in their world right now. First game, family in town, we don’t want to over burden him with details, we want him to play the game and we want him to enjoy the process. I think the less he has on his mind, the more instinctual hockey, the better chance he has for success. So, we haven’t sat with him and gone through everything, what to expect and what not to expect. If he comes to us, we can certainly help him, but we’ll leave him alone. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e I just want to play my game. Just like the rookie tournament, just like preseason, I just want to come in there and play. Yes, it’s going to be a big moment, yes it’s going to be really exciting, but I think after that first shift I’ll just settle in and do what I do, then I’m just playing hockey again, it’s just another game. There’ll be whirlwind of emotions right off the bat, but I think once I settle in, once the game just starts flowing, I’ll be just fine. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e [[Gabe Vilardi|Gabe]] is a big body and myself, so we’ve got to use that size, wear down their D, get on pucks a little bit quicker, and Al is so good with his stick and he uses his body well. I think we’re a line that can grind down teams and wear them down to get our opportunities like that. -- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\n\u003e Obviously we wanted to win the game, but looking at our line I feel like there was good support all around the rink for us. We talk during the practices we’ve had and during the game, just talking about where we’re going to be depending on the forecheck, where the pieces are in place, so I feel like it was good for us to get that game in. We’ll keep growing. -- [[Alex Iafallo]]\n\n\u003e He can be a little bit of the conscience on the line, he’s a veteran player, he’s a calm individual that doesn’t get overly frustrated. He can talk them through situations and he takes care of somebody’s defensive assignments so that \\[Byfield and Vilardi] can roll a little bit more. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e Once we get in the o-zone, [[Alex Iafallo|Al]] is a very hard-working guy, he’s a smart player, an underrated smart player and Q is so gifted with the puck. We’ve just got to get to the o-zone, we’re good when we get to the o-zone and we’ve got to do the things defensively to get there. -- [[Gabe Vilardi]]","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/10-15-Postgame-For-a-lot-of-years-in-the-league-this-ones-tough-to-explain":{"title":"10-15 Postgame - “For a lot of years in the league, this ones tough to explain”","content":"\n# 10-15 Postgame - “For a lot of years in the league, this ones tough to explain”\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-15 | [[The Forum Report]] | [10-15 Postgame - “For a lot of years in the league, this ones tough to explain”](https://theforumreport.com/10-15-postgame-for-a-lot-of-years-in-the-league-this-ones-tough-to-explain/) |\n| 2022-10-15 | [[The Forum Report]] | [[10-15 Postgame - “For a lot of years in the league, this ones tough to explain”]]                                                                                                       |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jon Rosen]]\n\n\n## Players\n- \n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e In a polar contrast to their traditionally structured and defense-focused games a half-generation earlier, the LA Kings and Minnesota Wild erupted for a Smythe Division-level of offensive entertainment as the Kings ably responded to every Wild challenge in a building often unforgiving to teams trying to iron out their games.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e Fuckin’ hope we never have to win like that again, but give the guys a lot of credit. They battled back every time \\[Minnesota] put us on our heels and it’s not very often the last couple years that we’ve been able to trade goals when we’ve needed them, and this was a night we needed to find some goals, and we found them. A lot of credit goes to the guys. That’s obviously not the way I think we want to be winning these games, but hey … sometimes throughout the season some games are going to call for that. -- [[Cal Petersen]]\n\n\u003e I had to decide there, when they tied it up, I was like, ‘we can’t give up another goal,’ and once we scored, I decided that was it. But we got some huge, huge blocks from [[Phillip Danault|Phil]], from [[Mikey Anderson|Mikey]] down the stretch, so I had some other goalies back there with me. -- [[Cal Petersen]]\n\n\u003e Today I felt pretty good from the start, and obviously a little more motivated playing against my old team. -- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n\n## [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e You can see little snippets of things that are starting to happen, and that’s a positive sign.\n\n\n\u003e I thought that [[Gabe Vilardi|Gabe]] and [[Quinton Byfield]], other than maybe the penalty he didn’t need to take at the end, they were very capable of playing in those situations. … [[Trent Yawney]] has a tremendous amount of confidence in all six guys and he’s willing to put them out there. That’s how you grow as a team and how you grow as individuals. But we’re playing to win, and if we have to cut it back, we will. \n\n\u003e For me, goaltending’s a lot ilke pitching. It’s tough to find your Cy Young Winner in April. You usually find them in September and October, and goaltending around the league is probably like that – it’s finding its way. We have to help our goaltenders as much as we can. We haven’t been as tight as we’ve been, we haven’t broken out as clean, and the \\[penalty parade] puts a lot of pressure on them.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/10-15-Preview-Potential-Lineup-+-Fialas-Return-Minnesota-Natives-Seeking-Identity-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"10-15 Preview - Potential Lineup + Fialas Return, Minnesota Natives, Seeking Identity - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# 10-15 Preview - Potential Lineup + Fialas Return, Minnesota Natives, Seeking Identity - LA Kings Insider\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-15 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [10-15 Preview - Potential Lineup + Fialas Return, Minnesota Natives, Seeking Identity - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/15/10-15-preview-potential-lineup-fialas-return-minnesota-natives-seeking-identity/)\n2022-10-15 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[10-15 Preview - Potential Lineup + Fialas Return, Minnesota Natives, Seeking Identity - LA Kings Insider]]\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n- [[Sean Durzi]]\n- [[Cal Petersen]]\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Mikey Anderson]]\n- [[Blake Lizotte]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings are on the road for the first time this season, as they begin a five-game trip this evening versus the Minnesota Wild.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e It’s interesting how quick bumps and bruises occur. You don’t quite see them during exhibition season, you do a little bit, but when the real season starts, that’s another thing we’re starting to figure out, it’s hard and it’s good for us to have a few of those right now. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e It’s a little weird, but in a good way. I’m happy to be back and excited for the game tonight, to play against my old teammates, see them again and to be back in the old arena, with the fans. I really enjoyed my time here, it’s exciting to be back. -- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n\u003e I don’t think we’ve played great in these two games, we played better in the preseason, I think, but that’s how it goes, it’s up and down. The chemistry will come, we’re three good players and I can see our line being very effective. I think tonight will be a good night. -- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n\u003e For Kevin coming back, this is the first time and it happens real early in the season. For as much as we’d like to make it about Kevin and play really well, we’re not in that luxurious position right now of everything going the way we want it to, so we’ll focus on the team. There are different ways you can acknowledge his return in the locker room, whether it’s the starting lineup or something like that, but it is more about the Kings than it is Kevin tonight. I wish it was the other way, but it just isn’t. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e In the first COVID year, like 40 people were able to come to the game and someone on the Minnesota side got my mom and dad tickets, but other than that, this will be the first one. It’s fun to be back, everything I do is around this part of town, so it’s fun to be back and see everything, see mom, dad and everyone. -- [[Mikey Anderson]]\n\n\u003e It’ll be fun, I’ve been to enough games growing up here where it’ finally fun to have family, friends and everyone in the crowd but at the same time, it’s a big, important game for us, especially with how we’ve started, so we’re trying to get back on track. -- [[Mikey Anderson]]\n\n\u003e We’ve got to decide who we want to be and how we want to play. When you have some success, or a margin of success the year prior, coming back is a hard thing. You tend to wander away from what your identity is, especially when you’ve added talent, and you forget how hard it was. Right now we’re in that funk, where we’ve got to figure out who we want to be and how we’re going to do it. Tonight’s opponent will be a real good challenge for us, because if we keep choosing the route we’re choosing, I don’t think we’re going to have success for a little while, but eventually we’ll get there. -- [[Todd McLellan]]","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/10-17-Preview-Full-Morning-Skate-Today-+-McLellan-on-Offense-Defense-Zone-Entries-and-detROYt-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"10-17 Preview - Full Morning Skate Today + McLellan on Offense-Defense, Zone Entries and detROYt - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# 10-17 Preview - Full Morning Skate Today + McLellan on Offense-Defense, Zone Entries and detROYt - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-17 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [10-17 Preview - Full Morning Skate Today + McLellan on Offense-Defense, Zone Entries and detROYt - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/17/10-17-preview-full-morning-skate-today-mclellan-on-offense-defense-zone-entries-detroyt/) |\n| 2022-10-17 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[10-17 Preview - Full Morning Skate Today + McLellan on Offense-Defense, Zone Entries and detROYt - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                                                               |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The first road trip of the season continues, as the Kings visit Detroit to take on the Red Wings in game two of five in total.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Matt Roy]]\n- [[Alex Iafallo]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n- One Side Up, One Side Down\n- Offensive \n- Defensive\n- Rush Hour 2\n- detROYt\n\n\u003e I think you saw some of it last year.

They can still get better, but they’ve improved and we want to continue to grow that. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e Getting those rush chances and driving the net is going to help us win games. Scoring off the rush is going to be huge, getting shots off of those, not missing any passes and staying consistent there and we’ll be fine. -- [[Alex Iafallo]]\n\n\u003e We’ve got a lot of fast guys on this team, we play the 1-3-1 and create turnovers in the neutral zone and go from the other way, right away,” Vilardi added. “That’s something for sure.

I think, then, you’re starting all over again. Our lines will stay pretty much intact. We’ll look at filling that Iafallo spot with somebody else, whether it’s Arthur, Grnuny or Lemieux, someone like that and we’ll make that decision and go from there. There’s always the opportunity for in-game adjustments if it’s not going well. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e No \\[nothing special] it’s just more of the same. Listen to the training staff, they’ve been great for us in the past and we’ll continue to lean on them. Just take care of your body and all that stuff and we should be good. -- [[Trevor Moore]]\n\n\u003e In those situations, everybody was important, you’ve got to use the full bench and all six D and try to balance it out. I don’t recall our penalty totals in those back-to-back games, obviously there’s a lot of data there, but if you can stay out of the box, you do yourself a favor. Goaltending in back-to-back games is huge, it’s the backbone of playing especially early in the year. Other than that, it’s an old cliche, but you need everybody, especially early when your body and mind may not be used to it. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e They did look like themselves. They checked, they played very well defensively, they kept plays alive, created when they had to create. They did a lot of things that we witnessed for 82 games last year. You know, for individuals, it takes little time to find your own rhythm, to find your group’s rhythm and then your team rhythm and we’re still not there, but we’re doing our best to get to that point. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e I feel like this was the first game I felt like myself again. It was a good step in the right direction, I think. -- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n\n\u003e Yeah, you try to get the pace underneath you and the rhythm of the game. It’s a lot of penalties and stuff and you get off rhythm and have to get back on it. It’s been tough, but I think I’m getting there, I’m just trying to build on it every game. -- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/10-2-Preview-Projected-Lineup-+-Final-4-Plan-Walkers-Long-Awaited-Return-McLellan-Video":{"title":"10-2 Preview – Projected Lineup + Final 4 Plan, Walker’s Long Awaited Return, McLellan Video","content":"\n# 10-2 Preview – Projected Lineup + Final 4 Plan, Walker’s Long Awaited Return, McLellan Video\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-02 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [10-2 Preview – Projected Lineup + Final 4 Plan, Walker’s Long Awaited Return, McLellan Video](http://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/02/10-2-preview-projected-lineup-final-4-plan-walkers-long-awaited-return-mclellan-video/)\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Sean Walker]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings are back at it for their fourth game of the 2022 preseason, as they host the Anaheim Ducks tonight at Crypto.com Arena.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e The plan is to play Quickie, he’ll start today and to play him a full game. If he doesn’t finish the night, something went wrong somewhere, but the plan is that. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e A common theme around the league is you dress a few more veterans at home, you don’t have to travel them to wherever you’re going. They play big, big minutes during the year, so alleviating travel, I think you’re seeing that. The tendency is that the home team at points has a stronger lineup, or a more veteran-type lineup, because that’s where you want to play those individuals, while the road team tends to be a little younger, or guys that won’t play as much during the year. I think that’s a tendency around the league and that’s what we’re seeing again this year. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e We’ve got four left and we play every second night, we’re still trying to evaluate some of the question marks and they need to continue to play, but we have to make sure now that the team is up and running. By the end of the training camp, the veterans should all have three or four games for sure. Maybe not quite today, but moving forward, you’d like to see all your units together at one point, pairs playing with each other on the penalty kill, I think that’s important. We still have a day or two here to evaluate and try to give opportunity to someone. Every player has a lifeline and some players have extended there’s, others, it’s shrunk on them. This is the week. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n### [[Sean Walker]]\n\u003e Very excited, it’ll probably be a lot of nerves for the first game back, even though it’s exhibition, but it’ll be exciting and nervewracking. I’m just trying to go out and play my game.\n\n\u003e I think it’ll just be kind of the first of everything, the first three on two, the first battle along the boards, the first o-zone shift, the first shot on net. I think it’ll be a lot of things, just checking all the boxes and making sure that everything feels good. So I’m definitely excited, just want to go out there, not think about it too much and just play.\n\n\u003e Yeah, we have a great group of guys and I think everybody kind of knew where I was coming from. There were definitely some plays that were hard and guys gave me some good bumps, but you know nothing ever really recreates when you’re playing against another team. It’ll be a good test and I’m excited for it.\n\n\u003e Yeah, get that contact, I think that’s been a big thing. You know, I’ve done all the checklists and the skating, the positioning, whatever that is, but the body contact was probably the main thing. It’ll be a good test and like I said, I’m excited for it.\n\n\u003e The biggest challenge was just not playing. A lot of people talk about the mental side of it, the physical side of it and luckily, I didn’t have too much of a struggle with it. I was able to come here and do my rehab every day, be with the guys every day and the team was great helping me out with anything I needed, getting me tickets to concerts, anything that could keep me busy. So, as much as it was trying year and it was awful because I wanted to be a part of it, I was able to do some things that you’re not able to do when you are playing a season. It was it was really difficult and everything but I made the most of it and I’m ready to be back.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/10-20-Preview-Starting-How-It-Ended-+-Growth-and-Mentality-Third-Line-Makeup-Byfield-On-Trust-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"10-20 Preview - Starting How It Ended + Growth and Mentality, Third Line Makeup, Byfield On Trust - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# 10-20 Preview - Starting How It Ended + Growth and Mentality, Third Line Makeup, Byfield On Trust - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 2022-10-20 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [10-20 Preview - Starting How It Ended + Growth and Mentality, Third Line Makeup, Byfield On Trust - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/20/10-20-preview-starting-how-it-ended-growth-mentality-third-line-makeup-byfield-on-trust/) |\n| 2022-10-20 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[10-20 Preview - Starting How It Ended + Growth and Mentality, Third Line Makeup, Byfield On Trust - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                                                               |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings have reached the second to last destination on their first road trip of the season, as they square off with the Penguins this evening in Pittsburgh.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Cal Petersen]]\n- [[Alex Edler]]\n- [[Alex Iafallo]]\n- [[Arthur Kaliyev]]\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e There are a lot of areas, it’s just not consistent enough yet. Better defensively the last two games, penalty kill has improved, fewer trips to the penalty box, goaltending has got better as the nights have gone on. Coming back and doing it the right way, we were down 3-1 to Seattle and we took some penalties in the third, didn’t give ourselves a chance and in Nashville, we drew penalties, so there are a lot of positive signs.\n\n\u003e Identity is developed with a lot of characteristics that are unmeasurable. You can’t chart them, they don’t show up in the analytics too often and \\[resilliancy] has to become part of the identity. After that, what do we look like while we’re doing it?\n\n\u003e All three of them, they’re all capable, they’re all veterans now in the league. None of them should feel uncomfortable playing in any situation, they have great experience, in fact, all of them should feel fairly confident right now. Arty had a real good bounce back game, he was engaged physically against a physical team, and all three of them have to pick up the clean-up responsibility of the defensive play, and they’re very capable.\n\n\u003e For Arthur, he’s got a tremendous skill set that he’s relied on his whole life and it’s very useful for our group and in the National Hockey League. But, there are other things that have to happen when you’re not in that situation, and we’re trying to get him to expand his game a little bit now that he’s played. It’s a good sign for him and for us if you noticed that.\n\n### [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\u003e It’s the same mindset for me and G, but AI is a key piece to be missing for our team. He does everything, he can play anywhere in the lineup, but Arty is an amazing player as well. He’s super offensive, he has that shot, so we just have to find him and he’s going to bury it. He’s a great replacement.\n\n\u003e It’s just a good feeling to be out there, just being able to contribute on the play. Earning the coach’s trust to put us out there in a lot of different situations, luckily we scored that goal and I think it’s a big confidence booster for all of us. We’re all young guys here, and it’s just a trust factor there.\n\n\u003e Yeah, I think so, we’re playing later into games now. On the road, other teams can put their top lines against us and it’s not just taking us off, it’s trusting us against them, trusting that we can play against them and contribute against them. I think it’s definitely gone up a bunch.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/10-22-Preview-Full-Team-Skate-in-Washington-+-Edler-Returns-Preaching-Defense-Fourth-Line-Fury-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"10-22 Preview - Full Team Skate in Washington + Edler Returns, Preaching Defense, Fourth Line Fury - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# 10-22 Preview - Full Team Skate in Washington + Edler Returns, Preaching Defense, Fourth Line Fury - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 2022-10-22 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [10-22 Preview - Full Team Skate in Washington + Edler Returns, Preaching Defense, Fourth Line Fury - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/22/10-22-preview-full-team-skate-in-washington-edler-returns-preaching-defense-fourth-line-fury/) |\n| 2022-10-22 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[10-22 Preview - Full Team Skate in Washington + Edler Returns, Preaching Defense, Fourth Line Fury - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                                                                    |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The road trip comes to a close this evening in Washington, as the Kings visit the Capitals to complete a five-game swing.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Jonathan Quick]]\n- [[Alex Edler]]\n- [[Drew Doughty]]\n- [[Brendan Lemieux]]\n- [[Blake Lizotte]]\n- [[Carl Grundstrom]]\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e It should help a lot. \\[[[Alex Edler]]]’s got a defensive mindset right now, where he is in his career, he understands the game well, he’s got some size, a good reach, anticipates plays well. I would consider us a much better defensive team any time he’s in the lineup.\n\n\u003e You used the word preach, so when you go to church, the preacher is important, but the people sitting in the pews are the ones that really make the church up and you either believe it or you don’t. Drew can continue to do that, I can do that, everybody else in there can have an opinion, but the church-goers have to buy into it. I’ve said this in the past, the DNA of defending and taking pride in that has been a big part of this team’s run to cups, a big part of its rebuild. I don’t think that’s gone away but I think it has to show up a little bit more.\n\n\n### [[Alex Edler]]\n\u003e I’m just trying to play very solid defensively, that’s when we’re good, when we take care of our own end and you can create a lot of offense just by playing good defense. We’ve just got to focus on that and make sure that we’re taking care of that part of the game.\n\n### [[Drew Doughty]]\n\u003e Yeah, that’s definitely something I’m talking about all the time, we’ve got to play good defense. We’re leaving the goalies out to dry at times, they’re making big saves, sometimes they’re going in, but we’ve got to be better defensively. I know guys want to get their points and play offense but that’s not how you win games in my opinion. We’re not a team that’s going to win games 6-5, we need to be a team that’s giving up two or three goals a night and that’s the most that we’re giving up. I’m not the only one preaching that, everyone’s preaching that, it’s something we know we need to fix.\n\n### [[Brendan Lemieux]]\n\u003e  I think it’s simplicity to be honest with you. We’re just playing simple, we know where each other is on the ice, we’re not looking to do anything cute. We’re playing the game the way a fourth line is supposed to play it, which is simple and making things hard on the other team.\n\n\u003e I just think we played our game, we were generating opportunities, generating chances and creating momentum. Our line’s been going good, I’m happy with the way we’ve been playing. Haven’t seen as much production early, like we did last year, but I think it’s only a matter of time with the way we’ve been playing.\n\n### [[Carl Grundstrom]]\n\u003e I thought we skated well, we helped each other out and we got pucks to the net. \\[Energy and forechecking] is huge for our game, we’ve got to keep doing that to be successful.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/10-24-Practice-Kings-address-areas-of-focus-+-McLellan-on-Lines-Lizotte-on-Identity-Robitaille-Joins-ATKM-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"10-24 Practice - Kings address areas of focus + McLellan on Lines, Lizotte on Identity, Robitaille Joins ATKM - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# 10-24 Practice - Kings address areas of focus + McLellan on Lines, Lizotte on Identity, Robitaille Joins ATKM - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-24 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [10-24 Practice - Kings address areas of focus + McLellan on Lines, Lizotte on Identity, Robitaille Joins ATKM - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/24/10-24-practice-kings-address-areas-of-focus-mclellan-on-lines-lizotte-on-identity-robitaille-joins-atkm/) |\n| 2022-10-24 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[10-24 Practice - Kings address areas of focus + McLellan on Lines, Lizotte on Identity, Robitaille Joins ATKM - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                                                                               |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings hit the ice this morning for their first on-ice practice as a group since Friday, October 14. The team had two main focal points, per Todd McLellan, as they hit the ice today on the heels of a five-game road trip.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Sean Durzi]]\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n- [[Alex Iafallo]]\n- [[Blake Lizotte]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n- [[Luc Robitaille]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e We needed it, we need more of it and being at home will help. We picked two areas of the game that we have to clean up and tried to just concentrate on that. There are other areas, but we picked those two areas and I thought we had their attention, the guys gave each other a good effort in practice today. We paid attention to the details of certain situations and practiced well in those situations, so hopefully we improve.\n\n\u003e What I’ve heard, just from the coaches room, is ‘it’s not a bad trip’ and I don’t think we ever want to hear that, it’s not a bad trip, we should be in a position right now where it should be a good trip. \\[Then you hear], not from the coaches room, ‘well, if you could have held on to that last game, it would have been 4-1 and an outstanding trip.’ Statistically speaking for points, that would be great, but you can look at it the other way. We gave up six and won a game, we missed an empty net and had to go to overtime and win in the shootout, we came back from 3-1. For me, that trip was a wide-open slate and it could have went either way. If we would have come back 1-4 instead of 3-2, I don’t think there’s a big swing in that, it could have been 4-1 as well. What I’m trying to say is it was an inconsistent trip from period to period, shot to shot, goal to goal and that’s something we have to clean up.\n\n\u003e I’m comfortable with two right now, I was comfortable with three. I thought that [[Quinton Byfield]]’s line at the beginning of the year was one of our better lines, there was no concern. They could still be that, Al’s a different player, right now we’ve got Arthur there, it’s a little bit different. I think Lizzo’s line has an identity, they know who they are and they play that way.

What I mean by that is he can play a fast game, a physical game, a thinking game and he plays on both sides of the puck quite well. Often with those guys, you’ll hear that you’ve got to really watch them close to appreciate them, but we’ve talked ad nauseam about this. You often don’t miss them until you miss and we miss him.\n\n### [[Blake Lizotte]]\n\u003e Yeah, I think it’s kind of been building for us over the last four games, I think we’ve found our our energy and found our role. I think our chances for versus chances against is at a great spot right now and unfortunately for us, it’s not bouncing in our favor at the moment. I think we’re finding ways to contribute to the team, whether it’s bringing energy or an o-zone shift or positivity on the bench, I think we’re finding a way to impact the team positively even when we don’t necessarily get on the scoresheet.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/10-24-The-Week-That-Was-The-Week-That-Is":{"title":"10-24 - The Week That Was, The Week That Is","content":"\n# 10-24 - The Week That Was, The Week That Is\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-24 | [[Kings at NHL.com]] | [10-24 - The Week That Was, The Week That Is](https://www.nhl.com/kings/news/1024---the-week-that-was-the-week-that-is/c-336733264) |\n| 2022-10-24 | [[Kings at NHL.com]] | [[10-24 - The Week That Was, The Week That Is]]                                                                                     |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jack Jablonski]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings finished up their season opening five-game road this past week, playing four games over six days.

It’s pretty good opponent for us to have tonight to see if we can get it going in the right direction consistently. It’s been going in the right direction, but inconsistently.\n\n\u003e This team likes to play long and they’re good at it. They also have defensemen that are very active, jumping into the play and they’ve had success doing that. When you talk about a pinch, you often talk about what your defenseman is doing and how he’s doing it and when but that’s the player going south, the other players coming north are as important or more important. There are situations where all five players are involved successfully or unsuccessfully in pinches.\n\n\u003e The last few times we played them they weren’t necessarily healthy. They had some pretty good players out of their lineup and they’ll have their best tonight and that’s real good. They rely on their goaltender to be a stabilizing factor for them and I just wrote in our pre-scout that they play their game and they try and impose it on their opponent, that’s what they do.\n\n### [[Blake Lizotte]]\n\u003e \\[[[Carl Grundstrom]]] is just a workhorse, he throws his weight around and he can score around the net. If you give him a few chances around the net, it’s going to go in. I think Carl brings that bulldog attitude, along with Lemieux, where we can break teams down by using our bodies and our legs on the forecheck. I think that chemistry is at a good spot right now.\n\n### [[Brendan Lemieux]]\n\u003e [[Carl Grundstrom|Grunny]] can play a simple game, but also has the offensive ability and skill to make other plays. I think our line has an identity and how the coaching staff has wanted us to play is that simple style of game over and over and repeat that process.\n\n### [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\u003e Yeah, it was a really good feeling, it was late in the game, down 6-0 to make it 6-1 isn’t the most memorable story ever but it’s still something I’ll cherish for a long time. I have the puck and it’s definitely something I’ll keep forever.\n\n\u003e \\[In the OHL] with Barrie, we were so central that we rarely ever stayed in hotels and a lot of the young guys had school. It was fun to just be around the team for so long, we all bonded, so that was nice. The guys all included me in dinners and what not and I had a great time on the trip.\n\n\u003e Yeah, it’s kind of wild, my buddies are always watching the game and sending me photos standing next to those guys, it’s pretty funny. I feel like in warm up, looking over and \\[Crosby] is doing his warm up on the McDonald’s sign, that’s kind of when I’m looking over there like wow, they’re here. I think when the puck drops, the game starts, it doesn’t really cross my mind. I feel like I’m good in that sense.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/10-26-Practice-Todays-Alignment-+-First-Line-Makes-Progress-The-JADebut-Pinellis-Hot-Start-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"10-26 Practice - Todays Alignment + First Line Makes Progress, The JADebut, Pinellis Hot Start - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# 10-26 Practice - Todays Alignment + First Line Makes Progress, The JADebut, Pinellis Hot Start - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-26 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [10-26 Practice - Todays Alignment + First Line Makes Progress, The JADebut, Pinellis Hot Start - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/26/10-26-practice-todays-alignment-first-line-makes-progress-the-jadebut-pinellis-hot-start/) |\n| 2022-10-26 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[10-26 Practice - Todays Alignment + First Line Makes Progress, The JADebut, Pinellis Hot Start - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                                                                |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Practice Day, Insiders! We’ve reached a bizarro world where the Kings are able to practice twice in three days. Crazy stuff. The team was back on the ice earlier today at Toyota Sports Performance Center, with eyes now set on tomorrow’s opponents, the Winnipeg Jets. Coming off of perhaps the best 60 minutes of the season yesterday evening against the Tampa Bay Lightning, the Kings are looking to build off of that performance with two more here at home over the next three days.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n- [[Jaret Anderson-Dolan]]\n- [[Francesco Pinelli]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Adrian Kempe]]\n\u003e I think it’s coming together more and more. We haven’t scored as much as we’ve wanted to but we’ve still had chances and we’ve got to take care of our own zone first. That’s way we’ve been playing, that’s the way the Kings play, we’ve done that for many years. We take care of our zone, we’re going to get chances and we’re going to frustrate teams and then start getting more chances and goals. We have to keep doing that, I think it showed a little bit yesterday which is a good thing for our line.\n\n\u003e Going back to last year, the way the entire team played we were good in the d-zone and eventually we’ll get our chances. At the start of the season, I think we’ve been playing a little bit too risky offensively. We won some games and scored a lot of goals but defensively hasn’t been where we want it to be. I think we showed up in the right direction yesterday and hopefully we can keep that going.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e When you bring a new offensive player in, I’m talking about Kevin now, you pop him onto that line and everybody’s thought goes to offense and driving plays. Kevin is very good at that. The DNA of Kopi and Juice it’s from our end out and I’m not saying Kevin’s DNA is different, they’re just trying to mesh all of that together. I think Kevin will get to that point with Kopi and Kempe, eventually, where they realize that it starts here and goes that direction.\n\n\u003e \\[[[Jaret Anderson-Dolan]]] does and he has. If we go back to his entry into the lineup in Vegas the year before last, he came in and he had a tremendous game that night and got better as it went along. Then he got a shoulder injury and went back out, that’s not his fault, that’s just what happens in the game and it was tough to get his footing underneath him again. He’s been patient, he’s worked hard, he’s kept himself ready and strange circumstances again last night. He got called upon and I thought he played a real solid game.\n\n### [[Jaret Anderson-Dolan]]\n\u003e If you’re not playing, it’s a chance to get better and to take advantage of the extra ice time out there. It’s something I’ve really tried to key in on, just control what I can and be ready when the time comes.\n\n\u003e Conditioning, that’s all, just trying to keep your game legs as much as you can. When you’re watching the game, try to key in and keep your mental focus so when the time comes, you know what to do in those situations. I’ve been here for a few years now, so it’s the same system and it’s pretty easy to jump back into it.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/10-27-Preview-Arvidsson-Ready-To-Return-+-Potential-Lineup-Durzi-On-The-Left-TM-on-Jets-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"10-27 Preview - Arvidsson Ready To Return + Potential Lineup, Durzi On The Left, TM on Jets - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# 10-27 Preview - Arvidsson Ready To Return + Potential Lineup, Durzi On The Left, TM on Jets - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-27 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [10-27 Preview - Arvidsson Ready To Return + Potential Lineup, Durzi On The Left, TM on Jets - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/27/10-27-preview-arvidsson-ready-to-return-potential-lineup-durzi-on-the-left-tm-on-jets/) |\n| 2022-10-27 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[10-27 Preview - Arvidsson Ready To Return + Potential Lineup, Durzi On The Left, TM on Jets - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                                                             |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings are back in action this evening on home ice, as they host the Winnipeg Jets for the middle game of a three-game homestand.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n- [[Sean Durzi]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n- ### Viktory\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e Arvy is going to be able to go tonight. I thought Arvy was going to be able to go the other night until after warmups, but Arvy should be good to go.\n\n\u003e I sure hope so, he and we are all hoping that’s the case. Injury, double-bout of illness and we’re only a month into the season. It’s been a lot to go through, but it’s adversity. He’ll be fine.\n\n### [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n\u003e Yeah, I hope so. It’s just been bad bounces, being hurt, coming back, being sick, coming back and playing well but getting sick again. Hopefully this is the end and we can just work from here.\n\n- ### Left Side, Strong Side\n### [[Sean Durzi]]\n\u003e First of all, it’s playing within our team system and on the right side, it’s a little bit different. It’s kind of learning that aspect of it and not thinking about it as much and then once you get past that, you get your reps in, you work on it and you can play more freely and naturally like I usually do. Once I started getting used to playing within our system on the left side, I think everything else comes a little bit easier.\n\n\u003e Now that I’ve had a few games under my belt, with defending it’s a little bit different. I grew up on the right, hitting with this shoulder, hip check this way, you do everything the other way and then you switch. I’m comfortable playing the left and I think I can do it really well and with more reps, I’m not thinking about where I have to be within our structure and I can just play freely. When I’m playing freely, I’m at my best and I feel like I’ve been there for the last little bit.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e There’s a lot to learn when you do play your off side. Through no fault of his or anybody else that’s asked to go over there, it takes a while and situations arise that until you experience them, you really don’t know. We understand where to watch for it, we try and teach him those things, but it takes some time and it’s not an easy task.\n\n- ### McLellan Talks Winnipeg\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e Like all the teams, they’ve playedfew games this year, they have a new coaching staff and the coach has been sick so they’re trying to get their new systems and structure into place, but they played very hard. St. Louis, Rangers, in Colorado, those are their wins, so they’re beating some very good teams. Goaltending is outstanding, they seem to have the ability to grind really well below the tops of the circles in the o-zone, to keep a lot of plays alive. When you when you hear those characteristics, it’s the making a pretty good team, so we’ll have our hands full.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/10-29-Preview-Lineup-Changes-Expected-+-Kupari-Recalled-Gabes-Growth-Hockey-101-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"10-29 Preview - Lineup Changes Expected + Kupari Recalled, Gabes Growth, Hockey 101 - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# 10-29 Preview - Lineup Changes Expected + Kupari Recalled, Gabes Growth, Hockey 101 - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date     | Site | Link                                   |\n| -------- | ---- | -------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-31 |      | [10-29 Preview - Lineup Changes Expected + Kupari Recalled, Gabes Growth, Hockey 101 - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/29/10-29-preview-lineup-changes-expected-kupari-recalled-gabes-growth-hockey-101/) |\n\n## Contributors\n- \n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e \n\n\n## Players\n- \n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/10-31-Preview-Quick-Expected-+-Seeking-Consistency-Walkers-Comfort-Kuparis-Focal-Points-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"10-31 Preview - Quick Expected + Seeking Consistency, Walkers Comfort, Kuparis Focal Points - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# 10-31 Preview - Quick Expected + Seeking Consistency, Walkers Comfort, Kuparis Focal Points - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-31 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [10-31 Preview - Quick Expected + Seeking Consistency, Walkers Comfort, Kuparis Focal Points - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/31/10-31-preview-quick-expected-seeking-consistency-walkers-comfort-kuparis-focal-points/) |\n| 2022-10-31 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[10-31 Preview - Quick Expected + Seeking Consistency, Walkers Comfort, Kuparis Focal Points - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                                                             |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings are back on the road for three games in four nights, beginning later this evening in St. Louis versus the Blues.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n- [[Rasmus Kupari]]\n- [[Sean Walker]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### Consistency Coming More Consistently\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e I think we’re getting closer to it, it doesn’t mean that it’s going to be a Picasso tonight but we’re starting to realize the value of certain things again. It’s important and you can hear guys talking about it a lot more, situational decisions. I said the other day, Hockey 101, there’s a lot more talk about Hockey 101 in our locker room right now than there was after games three and four.\n\n\u003e We need to play that way. I know there will be others that think that if they go that way, they’re not going to be able to score. Well, we checked a lot better against Toronto and we were still able to score so I don’t buy that as an excuse……it’s not just one man, one staff or half a team ,it has to be everybody believes that.”\n\n### Walks This Way\n### [[Sean Walker]]\n\u003e Yeah, I’d say so. I think every game is kind of more and more back to normal, it’s just getting the fundamentals down and then going from there. It’s about getting comfortable and confident building off of it from there.\n\n\u003e I think that’s kind of the way we want to play in general anyways, you know, quick ups and if the forward is there, you get him the puck. The legs feel good, I wouldn’t say that’s anything I’m focusing on specifically, if I can skate it, I’m going to skate it but if someone’s open, I’m going to make that play.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e Yeah, closer to it. We’ve talked about him a little bit and you cannot make up for lost time. No matter how hard you try and how bad you want to do it, lost time is lost time and it’s gone. Sometimes when you chase that makeup phase, it becomes really tough……we’ve got to give him opportunities to experience it. The other night was a real good night for him, he did a lot of things well.\n\n### RasmusBerry Beret\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e He’s a big man that skates extremely well and his play without the puck is something we’re proud of,” Todd McLellan said of Kupari this morning. “He does a really good job sorting things out coming back to his end, he defends well, long stick and he’s a very good penalty killer when he has to do those things. Quite often, those first-round draft picks are always relied on to score, is this guy going to score 35 or 40, we want him to score but there are some things he does really well right now. If he keeps doing those things, it will keep them available to us.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/10-4-Preview-Projected-Lineup-+-Petersen-expected-Clarke-goes-5-for-5-Todays-Practice":{"title":"10-4 Preview – Projected Lineup + Petersen expected, Clarke goes 5-for-5, Today’s Practice","content":"\n# 10-4 Preview – Projected Lineup + Petersen expected, Clarke goes 5-for-5, Today’s Practice\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n 2022-10-04   | [[LA Kings Insider]]  | [10-4 Preview – Projected Lineup + Petersen expected, Clarke goes 5-for-5, Today’s Practice](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/04/10-4-preview-projected-lineup-petersen-expected-clarke-goes-5-for-5-todays-practice/)\n\n## Contributors:\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n## Players\n- [[Cal Petersen]]\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings and Ducks square off for the second time in three days, with the setting moving to Honda Center in Anaheim.\n\n## Notes\n\u003e If you see them in our group, they’re usually one-hundred percent, because there’s no way you can put a goalie in there and tell them to take it easy, waste of time.

Just movement, tracking pucks depending on what the injury is, and then they come back into the group. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e He doesn’t lack confidence and he doesn’t portray arrogance. That’s a pretty good quality to have. -- [[Todd McLellan]] on [[Brandt Clarke]] heading into his fifth of five pre-season games\n\n\u003e That’s kind of what I was hoping for, I love playing games. The games are the best part of hockey so yeah, it’s been it’s been really good so far and I’m not looking for a break. I’m not tired, I’ve got that youth in me, so I still have a pretty good engine. I’m not banged up or anything, I’m ready to go every night and I’m pretty happy that they keep putting me in there. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e I think so, yeah, that’s what I’ve been doing and everyone just keeps encouraging me, they keep showing me stuff to do and helping me out but they’re still encouraging me to do my thing. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e He feels comfortable with his toolkit, he can use it anywhere he wants on the ice. It’s different and it’s going to get even more different as early as \\[tonight’s game] as more and more top-six players come into the lineup and rosters get stronger and stronger. He’s discovering his boundaries using his confidence, what can I get away with and what can’t I. So far so good. It will be probably a smaller toolbox as the league gets better, but give him credit for using the tools that he has. -- [[Todd McLellan]] on [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e I’m really confident in myself right now, things have been going pretty well for me and I’m really happy with how I’ve been playing but you have to bring your best each game. You may have played well last game, but you have to step it up even more this game. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/10-6-Preview-Projected-Game-Group-+-Durzi-On-Return-Moverare-on-Opportunity-Utes":{"title":"10-6 Preview – Projected Game Group + Durzi On Return, Moverare on Opportunity, Utes","content":"\n# 10-6 Preview – Projected Game Group + Durzi On Return, Moverare on Opportunity, Utes\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n 2022-10-06   | [[LA Kings Insider]]  | [10-6 Preview – Projected Game Group + Durzi On Return, Moverare on Opportunity, Utes](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/06/10-6-preview-projected-game-group-durzi-on-return-moverare-on-opportunity-utes/)\n\n## Contributors:\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n## Players\n- [[Sean Durzi]]\n- [[Jacob Moverare]]\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings head into their penultimate game of the preseason with their annual trip to Salt Lake City to take on the Vegas Golden Knights.\n\n## Notes\n\n### [[Sean Durzi]] \n\n- Expected to play his first pre-season game, returning from off-season surgery. That surgery apparently was to fix an injury he managed for awhile.\n\n\u003e I think that he had an injury that was ongoing, it was there and it was just time to have it fixed so that it wouldn’t keep continue on. Did it affect this play a lot, I think he’s played a lot with it, maybe he got used to it, but it needed to be fixed. -- [[Todd McLellan]] on [[Sean Durzi]]\n\n\u003e I mean, it wasn’t great, but itt’s something where I knew I would miss some time and I was just waiting for the right time, even if there never really is a right time. I got it done and I’m looking forward to feeling even better. I guess I just got used to it and played through it. -- [[Sean Durzi]]\n\n\u003e Maybe just the speed of making reads defensively again, but obviously that comes with getting games in and that will come. The coaches are pushing me every day and making sure I’m doing things right and that I’m doing it to the best of my abilities and then pushing it to be even better than that. -- [[Sean Durzi]]\n\n\u003e Feeling good, ready to go. I’m excited finally and there’s not much more to do. Just go play. -- [[Sean Durzi]]\n\n\n### [[Jacob Moverare]]\n\u003e I see every day that I get to play here during preseason as an opportunity to show how I can play, play well and earn some trust with the team. -- [[Jacob Moverare]]\n\n\n\u003e I think it’s just about being steady, that’s my main thing that I need to really focus on. I have to prove that they can trust me to be a steady guy. In practice, every 2-on-1, every 3-on-2, I try to not get scored on and I want to hit every pass, focus on the small details. -- [[Jacob Moverare]]\n\n\u003e Both Edler and Royzie are two guys that I try to look at a little bit extra, because they’re both really steady guys. I try to watch them, see what they do and how they play. -- [[Jacob Moverare]]\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/10-7-Practice-Arvidsson-approaches-game-action-+-final-tuneups-Tu-Liga-schedule":{"title":"10-7 Practice – Arvidsson approaches game action + final tuneups \u0026 Tu Liga schedule","content":"\n# 10-7 Practice – Arvidsson approaches game action + final tuneups \u0026 Tu Liga schedule\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n 2022-10-07   | [[LA Kings Insider]]  | [10-7 Practice – Arvidsson approaches game action + final tuneups \u0026 Tu Liga schedule](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/07/10-7-practice-arvidsson-approaches-game-action-final-tuneups-tu-liga-schedule/)\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n## Players\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Training camp practices are in the books!\n\u003e As Todd McLellan said last night and reinforced here this morning, the evaluation process has not ended, especially not with an exhibition contest still on the schedule for tomorrow.

It’s my first game back, so I need to be prepared for that, no time to spare. Just leave it all out there and then hopefully I’ll be ready for the home opener. -- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\n\u003e I got some good rest, you know, I had been playing a lot of hockey so that was nice but you want to be playing hockey every day. That definitely sucked, but they let me ease my way back into it over the last two, three days so I think I’m back up to speed with my cardio and everything. I’m just trying to get back into it. -- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\n\u003e Our net play, quite frankly, hasn’t been good. We spent a large chunk of practice \\[yesterday] just working on that one specific area and would like to see it pay dividends as early as tomorrow. It’ll be a work in progress. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e \\[Yesterday] in practice, we focused on net play. We’ve been struggling a little bit throughout the preseason and that’s something you obviously don’t work during the summer because you’re not trying to hurt guys or anything like that. That’s something that you need to get back through preseason, because you can’t work on it, it’s probably the main things, defending for real and net play. -- [[Drew Doughty]]\n\n\u003e The practices at the start camp are a little slow, too many guys, not getting enough reps. Now that we’ve narrowed it down, we can work on individual things, like at the end of practice, we worked on 2-on-2s, 1-on-1s and stuff like that. If you do have to start a camp, there’s just too many guys and guys aren’t getting reps. So you have to wait until you pare it down. -- [[Drew Doughty]]\n\n\u003e That player has to be a trusting player. The 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th forward, the seventh or eighth D, you have to be a trusting individual because you might not go every night but when your number’s called, we have to be able to trust you to go in and do the job on both sides of the puck.    -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e We have \\[moved players around] throughout exhibition season, some of it by design, sometimes when it just happens. Guys on the left side, the right side, I think [[Jaret Anderson-Dolan|Anderson-Dolan]] has played just about everywhere. You’re trying to calculate where he fits best, or where whoever that group is fits best in case of injury, poor play and how you spot them in. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/11-1-Preview-No-Morning-Skate-in-Dallas-+-McLellan-on-Fiala-Doughty/Anderson-Pairing-The-Big-100-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"Anderson Pairing, The Big 100 - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# Anderson Pairing, The Big 100 - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-11-01 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [Anderson Pairing, The Big 100 - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/11/01/11-1-preview-no-morning-skate-in-dallas-mclellan-on-fiala-doughty-anderson-pairing-the-big-100/) |\n| 2022-11-01 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[11-1 Preview - No Morning Skate in Dallas + McLellan on Fiala, Doughty/Anderson Pairing, The Big 100 - LA Kings Insider]]                                                               |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings are in Dallas this evening to conclude a back-to-back set, with the first matchup of the season against the Stars.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Cal Petersen]]\n- [[Jaret Anderson-Dolan]]\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Rasmus Kupari]]\n- [[Carl Grundstrom]]\n- [[Mikey Anderson]]\n- [[Drew Doughty]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e It’s not necessarily just the last couple of games, throughout training camp and for the most part, the regular season. \\[[[Kevin Fiala]]]’s had a knack for keeping plays alive, really good skill set, very good vision and we witnessed that last night. The game before, I think the combination of players that he’s with right now complement his skill set and as I said earlier, it balances everything out for our team right now. It’s a good look for us and it forces teams to think about how they want to play their D and their matchup forwards a little bit more. We’ll continue to do that until we have to make changes.\n\n\u003e He’s got a lot of experience, he’s a proven point producer, an offensive player, so when you put them on that line, he should be the alpha, he should be the guy that takes control. That’s not to underscore what the other two do for him. The speed, the tenacity, the finish of both \\[[[Rasmus Kupari]]] and \\[[[Carl Grundstrom]]] is a very complimentary pair to to Kevin skill set.\n\n\u003e As expected, \\[[[Mikey Anderson]] and [[Drew Doughty]]] should be leading the way, take care of what happens in our zone first and really our offense comes from how clean we break out. If we can break out clean and get skating up ice, we save a lot of energy and we’re connected, weel good about ourselves heading that way. Mikey and Drew do a good job of initiating that a lot of times.\n\n### [[Drew Doughty]]\n\u003e That’s our job as defensemen, that’s what we’re supposed to do, we’re supposed to defend the other team. Yeah, we’re supposed to get some points too, be more offensive, but we need to get back to playing better defense, that’s what our weakness is right now. and we need to sharpen it up.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/11-3-Preview-Morning-Skate-Notes-+-Fialas-Streak-PP-Unit-Balance-Kaliyev-ready-to-score-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"11-3 Preview - Morning Skate Notes + Fialas Streak, PP Unit Balance, Kaliyev ready to score - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# 11-3 Preview - Morning Skate Notes + Fialas Streak, PP Unit Balance, Kaliyev ready to score - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-11-03 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [11-3 Preview - Morning Skate Notes + Fialas Streak, PP Unit Balance, Kaliyev ready to score - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/11/03/11-3-preview-morning-skate-notes-fialas-streak-pp-unit-balance-kaliyev-ready-to-score/) |\n| 2022-11-03 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[11-3 Preview - Morning Skate Notes + Fialas Streak, PP Unit Balance, Kaliyev ready to score - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                                                             |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings conclude a three-game roadtrip later on this evening with their first game of the season against the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Jonathan Quick]]\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Arthur Kaliyev]]\n- [[Phillip Danault]]\n- [[Sean Durzi]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n- Five For Fiala\n### [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\u003e I think it’s just simplifying the game you know, it’s a part of success, I think, to just shoot some pucks, get to the front, get pucks down deep and grind them out. Just create some offense and I think the big thing is just simplifying our game a little bit.\n\n\u003e For sure, it’s nice to have all the lines going, it’s a team sport and I think especially in our wins so far, we’re playing good for 60 minutes as a team. I think we have to get back to that a little bit, but it helps us a lot to have that depth.\n- Second (?) PP Unit\n### [[Arthur Kaliyev]]\n\u003e I think we have a great combination of everything on that unit. We’re getting a lot of pucks on net, making great plays, keeping pucks alive. Overall, I think we’ve had everything, we’re doing a great job so hopefully we can keep it up.\n\n### [[Phillip Danault]]\n\u003e I think we just keep it simple and we have a secret weapon. We have two good units and I think we’re keeping it simple, attack the net and we’re all on the same page. We’re working to get loose pucks, retrieving pucks and those little details can bring you a long way.\n\n### [[Sean Durzi]]\n\u003e I mean, that’s good news, it’s good to find out that we got four in a row, but I think we just focus on what we can do well, do it to the best of our abilities and hopefully the puck goes in the net. Four games in a row means something’s working. We’re getting on the same page, we talk a lot talking about plays we want to make and where we want to be for each other and that’s really important.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e Second or first, it depends on how you look at it. We haven’t looked at it any different, there are times when they start, there’s other times when Kopi’s unit starts, but they’re getting some things done. Not Picasso goals, but they’re goals. They move the puck well, they are relentless in getting it back and sometimes they simplify things and it works for them.\n\n- To  Build Off that\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e Retrieval points, when you’re on that back side and the puck comes to the net ona certain angle, odds are it’s coming out into your area \\[[[Jim Hiller]]] talks about being ready to score not ready to shoot and there’s a big difference. I think we’re trying to get Arthur into that mindset of that comes to you get ready to score not just to shoot.\n\n### [[Arthur Kaliyev]]\n\u003e I just try to read it, thinking about where the puck is going to be. They put it in a good spot and then it’s just reading about where the rebound went and where the puck is going to be. Then I try to just end up there, right place at the right time.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/11-5-Preview-Full-Team-Skate-+-Striving-For-Consistency-Ras-matazz-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"11-5 Preview - Full Team Skate + Striving For Consistency, Ras-matazz- LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# 11-5 Preview - Full Team Skate + Striving For Consistency, Ras-matazz- LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site | External Link                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| ---------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-11-05 | [[LA Kings Insider]]     | [*11-5 Preview - Full Team Skate + Striving For Consistency, Ras-matazz- LA Kings Insider*](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/11/05/11-5-preview-full-team-skate-striving-for-consistency-ras-matazz/) |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings are back in California this evening to begin a four-game homestand against the Florida Panthers, a trip which continues with games on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday of next week.\n\n| Date | Site | Title / Internal Link | \n| ---- | ---- | --------------------- |\n| 2022-11-05 | [[LA Kings Insider]]    | [[11-5 Preview - Full Team Skate + Striving For Consistency, Ras-matazz- LA Kings Insider]] |\n\n## Players\n- [[Brendan Lemieux]]\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n- [[Jonathan Quick]]\n- [[Mikey Anderson]]\n- [[Rasmus Kupari]]\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e I think your team is in one of two spots – You’re repairing and trying to fix a few things or you’re adding and you’re moving ahead, I don’t think you’re ever in one spot. We have been probably more on the repair and fix side, so when you’re on the repair and fix side, you’re focused on two or three things that you’re trying to really polish up, if you will. When you’re playing really well and you’re on a roll, you start to add new stuff and then your attention goes differently. So the two or three things that we pick can be on both sides of the equation, if you will.\n\n\u003e For the most part \\[[[Rasmus Kupari]]]’s done, defensively, the things that we want from him. His ability to break up plays, hunt on the way back using his legs, defending in those situations have been really good. We’re working with him on his offensive production and the ability to create there. We’re working on faceoffs with him and we think that he can help us on the penalty kill, so there’s been a lot of positive things. But, like every player, there’s still more to accomplish.\n\n\u003e I think Kup has some offensive skills, he’s got tremendous legs and the ability to drive the puck to the net, or even drive deep and delay. Just a little more confidence in those situations and he does have a real good shot. I think he’s a very unselfish individual, so he feels like he wants to be not always shooting, play a give-go game. You’re quick, have good legs, dish it and jump to a hole. Some of it is experience, some is instincts.\n\n### [[Mikey Anderson]]\n\u003e I think a big part of it is having the trust in each other, knowing that your linemates and everyone is trying to do the right thing and do their jobs. Obviously, a lot of our momentum and our play comes from structure, so if we have everyone on the same page within the structure, usually it leads to positive momentum for us. I think that’s something we’ve got to continue to work on, making sure that every shift we’re all on the same page\n\n\u003e I think you can always get better with it. I feel that the last couple games we’ve had more streaks of doing what we need to do, to play a more complete game. I think it’s continually having to think about what we got to do and what’s going to bring us success, then making sure that we trust it and try and do it every shift if we’re able to.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/2020-NHL-Draft-LA-Kings-select-Quinton-Byfield-with-No-2-pick":{"title":"2020 NHL Draft - LA Kings select Quinton Byfield with No 2 pick","content":"\n# 2020 NHL Draft - LA Kings select Quinton Byfield with No 2 pick\n\n| Date     | Site | Link                                   |\n| -------- | ---- | -------------------------------------- |\n| 2020-10-06 | [[SB Nation]]     | [2020 NHL Draft - LA Kings select Quinton Byfield with No 2 pick](https://www.jewelsfromthecrown.com/2020/10/6/21505045/quinton-byfield-los-angeles-kings-nhl-draft-2020-second-overall-pick-sudbury-wolves-ohl) |\n| 2020-10-06 | [[SB Nation]]     | [[2020 NHL Draft - LA Kings select Quinton Byfield with No 2 pick]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Sie Morley]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Byfield is now the highest-drafted Black player by an NHL team.\n\u003e The Kings won the second overall selection in the 2020 NHL Draft Lottery, marking the fourth time in franchise history that the team has selected second.

burgeoning promise but also with more than their share of uncertainties.\n\u003e Here are five burning questions that the men in black and silver will answer over the course of 82 games.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n- [[Phillip Danault]]\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Alex Turcotte]]\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n- [[Jonathan Quick]]\n- [[Drew Doughty]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n- [[Marco Sturm]]\n- [[Jim Hiller]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n1) Will the power play finally produce?\n   \u003e Jimmy brought a fresh set of eyes to our video from last year. It wasn’t tainted with opinion or frustration or joy. He shared a lot of thoughts and ideas with us, so we adopted some of those things. He’s been around some good players and good power plays. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n2) Who are these guys, really?\n   \u003e There’s always a place for progression, no place for regression. I don’t want to think that way, being scared of regression. I just want to get better as a team and as a player, and I’ll do whatever I can to win a Cup here. -- [[Phillip Danault]]\n3) How much will Brandt Clarke play?\n   \u003e He doesn’t lack confidence and he doesn’t portray arrogance. That’s a pretty good quality to have. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n4) Blue chips or red flags?\n   \u003e I know I can make plays, so I just need to be more confident in myself and in my game. The rest will follow. -- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n5) Can the Kings make the playoffs?\n   \u003e We’re on the old side of things right now, but me, Quickie and Drew, I think we still have quite a bit left. With the young guys developing as fast and as good as they did, I think it’s most definitely an opportunity to win again. -- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/2022-23-NHL-Rank-Top-player-predictions-across-teams":{"title":"2022-23 NHL Rank - Top player predictions across teams","content":"\n# 2022-23 NHL Rank - Top player predictions across teams\n\n| Date       | Site     | Link                                                                                                                                                 |\n| ---------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-18 | [[ESPN]]         | [2022-23 NHL Rank - Top player predictions across teams](https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/34817672/2022-23-nhl-rank-top-player-predictions-teams) |\n| 2022-10-18 | [[ESPN]] | [[2022-23 NHL Rank - Top player predictions across teams]]                                                                                           |\n\n## Contributors\n- ESPN staff\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The top 100 NHL players for the 2022-23 season are difficult to rank, given the incredible depth of talent at almost every position.\n\u003e To create our annual ranking of the NHL's top 100 players, we asked an ESPN panel of more than 50 hockey experts to rate players based on how good they will be in the 2022-23 season compared to their peers.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n- [[Drew Doughty]]\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n| Rank | Player           |\n| ---- | ---------------- |\n| 91   | [[Anze Kopitar]] |\n| 86   | [[Adrian Kempe]] |\n| 73   | [[Drew Doughty]] |\n| 57   | [[Kevin Fiala]]  |\n\n None in the top 100.\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/2022-Entry-Draft":{"title":"2022 Entry Draft","content":"\n# 2022 Entry Draft\nDate | Site | Title\n---|---|---\n\n\n## Unprocessed Coverage\nDate | Site | Title\n---|---|---\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/2022-Off-Season":{"title":"2022 Off-Season","content":"\n# 2022 Off-Season\nDate | Site | Title\n---|---|---\n2022-07-09 | [[Hockey Royalty]] | [[Look for the LA Kings to take a cautious approach in free agency]]\n\n\n\n## Unprocessed Articles\nDate | Site | Title\n---|---|---\n2022-08-01 | [[LA Kings on YouTube]] | [[2022 NHL Draft - Black \u0026 White presented by Spectrum]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylqj_TYtvyg)\n2022-07-02 | [[hockeyroyalty.com]] | [[3 LHD LA Kings can target post-Kevin Fiala trade]](https://hockeyroyalty.com/2022/07/02/3-lhd-la-kings-can-target-post-kevin-fiala-trade/)\n2022-06-29 | [[LA Times]] | [[Kings acquire left wing Kevin Fiala from Minnesota Wild - Los Angeles Times]](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-06-29/kings-acquire-left-wing-kevin-fiala-from-minnesota-wild)\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/2022-Off-season-10-Questions":{"title":"","content":"The 10 Biggest Questions For The 2022 LA Kings Offseason https://player.fm/1BQGQbk\n\n1. What will the other teams in the division do?\n\t1. Coaching\n\t2. Free agents\n\t3. Players asking to be traded\n\t4. Teams looking to move into the playoffs\n\t5. Vegas\n\t\t1. Fits almost all of those things\n\t\t2. Very little cap space\n\t6. Vancouver\n\t\t1. JT Miller\n\t\t2. Quinn Hughes\n\t\t3. Elias Petterson\n\t7. Anaheim\n\t\t1. Lots of cap space\n2. What happens at the draft?\n\t1. 19th overall in the first round\n\t2. Six picks, no seventh rounder\n\t3. Third rounder went to Nashville in the [Viktor Arvidsson trade](https://www.nhl.com/kings/news/la-kings-trade-draft-picks-for-viktor-arvidsson/c-325544088)\n\t4. Own Pens third rounder from [Jeff Carter trade](https://www.nhl.com/news/jeff-carter-traded-to-penguins-by-kings/c-323556688)\n\t5. Last year the Kings weren't quality over quantity, an artifact of the COVID year\n\t6. Blockbuster deals usually require trading a first rounder, but questioning the need for such\n\t7. 50 context limit and 90 player reserve list\n\t\t1. Didn't count players in junior\n\t\t2. If every RFA and UFA signed, 49 contracts \n3. Re-signing Adrian Kempe\n\t1. Arbitration eligible\n\t2. How many years of UFA are you buying?\n4. Re-signing Mikey Anderson\n\t1. Walker and Roy both signed second contracts for around $3M/year\n\t2. The Athletic said he's the 8th best shorten defensemen in the league\n5. Left defense\n\t1. Anderson/Bjornfot Young guys\n\t2. Edler/Maata veterans who might not have been anticipated to return, but now might\n\t3. Bjornfot is only 20/21, had great tools, already 100 NHL games played, fell out of the lineup. Great with Roy, not great with Durzi. Might need a steady defenseman. He had a better season then just how it ended.\n6. Right defense\n\t1. Drew doughty is a lock. Roy is probable.\n\t2. Walker off of injury\n\t3. Durzi and Spence showed they can play. \n\t4. Faber, Grans, Clarke\n\t5. Spence and Grans can play on Ontario\n\t6. Durzi is no longer eager exempt. Clarke can only play in junior or the NHL \n\t7. What does the organization think is most important? Continuity, development, experience? Defense, offense?\n\t8. Didn't even mention Strand, Stetcher, Moverare, Wolanin\n7. RFA forwards other than Kempe\n\t1. JAD, Grundstrom, Lemieux, Villardi, Lias Andersson \n\t2. Grundstrom has a playoff game and did well. Maybe the most improved. Consistent when I'm the lineup. Impactful bottom six. Dustin Brown light.\n\t3.

Today’s contest is the first of seven total exhibition games, with three coming on the road, two at neutral sites and two at Crypto.com Arena.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Matt Roy]]\n\u003e Pace, physicality, positioning, I mean, sometimes in games, you just trust the guy to be on the right position, but in summer it’s as a kind of looping all over the place. There’s more structure now and in that sense, it makes the game a little bit easier, but at the same time, the pace, is the physicality of the stakes.\n\n\u003e Yeah, I think naturally, the guy like Brownie leaving kind of leaves a hole on the team and it doesn’t have to be one person stepping up. I think, us as a group, everyone can step up and contribute in different ways and fill the void that way.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]] on [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\u003e Everything about him so far has been real positive. The game that got Brandt here is the game that we’re seeing right now. He’s a cerebral player, he sees things, he anticipates well, he’s a great passer, he does play with some risk in his game, which isn’t a bad thing, and he’s very competitive.\n\n\u003e He’s going to learn a lot of the tricks of the trade, but he’s also going to teach some of those too because he has some things in him that some others don’t. His strength, fitness and conditioning are at a very elite level for junior and it has to get better for the pro level but that’s called being an underage player.\n\n### [[Akil Thomas]]\n\u003e These scrimmages are game-like, but they’re not a full game in a full barn and stuff like that. If I’m playing, I’m excited to get back into action and show what I can do.\n\n\u003e The biggest thing for me is that I feel prepared. That just gives me a little bit more confidence and that’s probably something I didn’t have last year because I wasn’t prepared, I didn’t skate once. It was tough coming back off of injury and especially coming back and then injuring my foot. It definitely took a while to get my legs back, but I feel really confident and I’m getting some good habits early on and trying to build off it.\n\n\u003e I don’t have a stern approach because in the past, maybe I’d be thinking I’ve got to do this or that and be a little bit nervous. For me it’s just about showing up to the game. I’ve done my work in the offseason to be prepared so I’m just going to pay attention to the video beforehand and make sure I’m playing well defensively and the rest will kind of happen.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/9-26-Preview-Projected-Lineup-+-Back-To-Back-Thoughts-JADs-Focus-Spence-Moverare-debuts":{"title":"9-26 Preview – Projected Lineup + Back-To-Back Thoughts, JADs Focus, Spence, Moverare debuts","content":"\n# 9-26 Preview – Projected Lineup + Back-To-Back Thoughts, JADs Focus, Spence, Moverare debuts\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-09-26 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [9-26 Preview – Projected Lineup + Back-To-Back Thoughts, JADs Focus, Spence, Moverare debuts](http://lakingsinsider.com/2022/09/26/9-26-preview-projected-lineup-back-to-back-thoughts-jads-focus-spence-moverare-debuts/)\n2022-09-26 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[9-26 Preview – Projected Lineup + Back-To-Back Thoughts, JADs Focus, Spence, Moverare debuts]]\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Jaret Anderson-Dolan]]\n- [[Jordan Spence]]\n- [[Jacob Moverare]]\n- [[Angus Booth]]\n- [[Lias Andersson]]\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n- \n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings will complete a preseason-opening back-to-back set this evening as they visit the Vegas Golden Knights at T-Mobile Arena.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Lias Andersson]]\n\u003e  It was fun. It was a different game, a lot of penalties, so there was no rhythm in the first two periods. A little different, but I think we stood up pretty well In the first period, we struggled a bit with penalties and then we started moving our feet a little bit more and in the second and third, I think we should be pretty happy with it.\n\n\u003e It’s been five games here in five days \\[between camp scrimmages and exhibition games]. I’m just trying to do the best with it, do my stuff in the gym and make sure that I’m ready to play.\n\n\n\n### [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\u003e Yeah, it was definitely not a standard flow, back and forth kind of game. They had a lot of pressure in the first period because we were killing the whole time and we had a lot of pressure in the second period because we were on the man advantage. That definitely gave our special teams guys a lot of practice and our kill was amazing, we barely gave them any shots, but our power play was definitely generating get some good shots off but unfortunately we didn’t bury any of them. \n\n\u003e With those three inter-squad games, and now two games in a row, it’s definitely going to be tiring after tonight, but they just want to see my consistency, that’s why they’re throwing me in there. I’m going to rise to the occasion, I’m not going to sit back or anything, I’m still going to play my game. I feel fine and I’m going to be ready to go.\n\n### [[Jaret Anderson-Dolan]]\n\u003e Yeah, definitely. I think for everyone, no matter what spot you’re in, for the guys that have been here, it’s getting your timing back and getting your game legs back and getting ready for the regular season. For guys that are competing for jobs, it’s just an opportunity to prove yourself, so I’m definitely excited.\n\n\u003e Puck possession and protecting pockets was the big focus this summer. It’s something they talked about with me at my exit meeting and I think I’ve gotten a little bit better at it over the summer. Now, it’s just translating that into my game and these preseason games.\n\n### [[Jordan Spence]]\n\u003e I think it just comes with the experience from last season. Luckily for me, I played 24 games, so for me to have that experience, I just want to bring that into camp and showcase what I can bring. I think I’m more confident this year, and it’s my goal to make the team, so we’ll see how it goes.\n\n\u003e I only had one game \\[at the Rookie Faceoff], but to have that five on five game, that pace, it got me a little bit more prepared than maybe the other guys, because I’m just used to fast play. I think it was good for me to come into main camp and have all of that conditioning.\n\n\u003e No one’s perfect, everyone makes mistakes, but I think it’s just the guys who bounce back and become better with that. For me, I know what I have to do to become a better player, I know my weaknesses. I’m just trying to do the best I can to fix those \\[during camp] and go from there in the future.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/9-28-Preview-Projected-Lineup-+-Reign-Returners-Defensive-Camp-Battle-Bjornfot-Quotes":{"title":"9-28 Preview – Projected Lineup + Reign Returners, Defensive Camp Battle, Bjornfot Quotes","content":"\n# 9-28 Preview – Projected Lineup + Reign Returners, Defensive Camp Battle, Bjornfot Quotes\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-09-28 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [9-28 Preview – Projected Lineup + Reign Returners, Defensive Camp Battle, Bjornfot Quotes](http://lakingsinsider.com/2022/09/28/9-28-preview-projected-lineup-reign-returners-defensive-camp-battle-bjornfot-quotes/)\n2022-09-28 | [[LA Kings Insider]] |  [[9-28 Preview – Projected Lineup + Reign Returners, Defensive Camp Battle, Bjornfot Quotes]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Tobias Bjornfot]]\n- [[Sean Durzi]]\n- [[Francesco Pinelli]]\n- [[Matt Roy]]\n- [[Sean Walker]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings and Sharks will square off for the second time in four days, as the two teams meet in Ontario for the inaugural Empire Classic.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Matt Roy]]\n\u003e Lots of good memories from Ontario, the community there was great and the fans were really passionate. My first year there, we made it to the playoffs so that was pretty fun playing there. I had great coaches and great teammates, which made it a lot of fun. It was a really great experience.\n\n\u003e When you’re playing in the AHL, you’re competing against your teammates \\[for callups] but you’re also competing with them. It’s cool that a lot of us have now come up together to the Kings.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e The one thing about Blakey is that he takes a lot of input in from the people that he has around him and I think that’s a real good quality. He has to make decisions based on roster spots, he has to make decisions based on salary cap, decisions based on performance, on waivers, on injuries, sometimes it’s combinations and pairs.\n\n\u003e That’s an option, we’re allowed to have 23 roster spots. We don’t know who will be healthy or who won’t be at that roster date. Any combination of 23 we can come up with is an option.\n\n\u003e I think when you get to the point where decisions are hard and there’s huge debate over them, that’s a good spot for an organization. It’s not just on the blue line, there are some forwards too, but when we’re doing that, we are potentially in a good spot. It’s up to us to produce at that point.\n\n### [[Tobias Bjornfot]]\n\u003e Yeah, I think it’s going good so far. There’s a little more structure and it’s more intense. In the summer, there’s not anyone watching you and here in camp, it’s more intense and there’s more structure.\n\n\u003eI do like to play in preseason games, it’s nice to get to get you going and get more into game shape. In Sweden, we used to play a lot of preseason games, we had 5-10 then, so I’m used to playing in a longer preseason.\n\n\u003e I worked on my strength, getting stronger and faster, all of that kind of stuff. We’ve got a lot of time during the offseason to work on that. I just wanted to come in ready and prepared for camp, bring my A game to camp.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/A-Development-Plan-for-Quinton-Byfield":{"title":"A Development Plan for Quinton Byfield","content":"\n# A Development Plan for Quinton Byfield\n\n| Date       | Site                              | Link                                                              |\n| ---------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2020-06-26 | [[The Hockey Tactics Newsletter]] | [A Development Plan for Quinton Byfield](https://jhanhky.substack.com/p/a-development-plan-for-quinton-byfield) |\n| 2020-06-26 | [[The Hockey Tactics Newsletter]] | [[A Development Plan for Quinton Byfield]] | \n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jack Han]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e How to give a unique prospect the best chance for success\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n- Begin with the end in mind\n\t- Best case\n\t1) Plays Center\n\t2) is a Plus-value contributor both special teams\n\t3) Challenges for 20 minutes of ice time or more per game\n\t4) Scores at a point-per-game pace once his game is at maturity\n- Show me how you move; tell me who you are\n\t- Hunched over skating style\n\t- Shoulders ahead of knees\n\t- Center of mass prevents loading ankles and staying low through sharp turns\n\t- Cutbacks will slow him down too much\n\t- Difficulty with passes on backhand low in the dzone\n\t- Worst case\n\t1) Plays LW\n\t2) Is a middle-six forechecking specialist\n\t3) Plays 10-14 minutes per game, mostly in a shutdown and PK role\n\t4) Scores less than 30 points a year\n- Embrace the chaos\n- The plan\n\t- Play the entire season in the OHL, aiming to be the best player on the best team\n\t- NHL team hires a player dev analyst to break down every game and a coach to ske with him every week\n\t- Does not play in an NHL game until his technical mastery matches that of Malkin at 20\n\t- In his first NHL season, his KPI is the number of possessions per 60 min; any defensive shortcomings will only be evaluated through the lens of \"Is he getting enough pucks?\"\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/A-Few-More-Narratives-Young-Guys-With-Old-Plays-Penalty-Kill-Prowess-Shootout-Selection-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"A Few More Narratives - Young Guys With Old Plays, Penalty Kill Prowess, Shootout Selection - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# A Few More Narratives - Young Guys With Old Plays, Penalty Kill Prowess, Shootout Selection - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 2022-10-19 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [A Few More Narratives - Young Guys With Old Plays, Penalty Kill Prowess, Shootout Selection - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/19/a-few-more-narratives-young-guys-with-old-plays-penalty-kill-prowess-shootout-selection/) |\n| 2022-10-19 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[A Few More Narratives - Young Guys With Old Plays, Penalty Kill Prowess, Shootout Selection - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                                                               |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Last night’s recap was actually one of the shortest ones of the year, and much of that stemmed down to a race against the clock.

As they continue to evolve as young players and continue to play well, they get more and their confidence level should be really high right now.\n- Killing It\n  \u003e I thought we had some good goaltending and I think guys were selling out and blocking shots. -- [[Matt Roy]]\n  \n  \u003e The goalie made saves and he got us whistles when we needed. The stands and the retrievals were pretty good tonight. In zone, we had some big blocks, I thought we were smart when penalty killing overtime, 4-on-3. We gave up some shots but they weren’t cross court shots and execution was pretty good. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n  \n  \u003e It just starts with blocking shots and getting our clears out and when they did have pressure, we minimized their opportunities and forced them into situations where either it wasn’t the play that they wanted or it was a relatively easy save for me. The guys did a great job, I think penalty kill has been big focus for us because that was something that we struggled at times with last year and it starts with the goaltending and goes on out. When we’re cohesive like that it works out really well. -- [[Cal Petersen]]\n- Shootout Selection\n  \u003e You know what, I had a few guys that mentioned number three. But we saw all our D take shots in exhibition season and they’re a little ways down the line. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/A-Special-Night-In-St-Paul-A-Look-Inside-Jack-Jablonskis-Gala-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"A Special Night In St Paul - A Look Inside Jack Jablonskis Gala - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# A Special Night In St Paul - A Look Inside Jack Jablonskis Gala - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [A Special Night In St Paul - A Look Inside Jack Jablonskis Gala - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/16/a-special-night-in-st-paul-a-look-inside-jack-jablonskis-gala/) |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[A Special Night In St Paul - A Look Inside Jack Jablonskis Gala - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                                     |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- \n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Jack Jablonski]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Last night was a special one in Minnesota for several reasons.\n\u003e\n\u003e It certainly doesn’t hurt that the Kings picked up their first win of the season, in exciting fashion over the Wild. Independent of the result, however, was an impactful and certainly heartwarming event that tied both teams together in a way that only the hockey community can.\n\u003e\n\u003e That tie is Jack Jablonski, an LA Kings employee – and contributing writer here on LAKI I might add – who grew up in Minnesota as a Wild fan. Jack’s life changed in high school, playing in Minnesota, when a hit he suffered during game play caused a severe spinal cord injury that left him paralyzed from the chest down, with limited movement in his upper body.\n\u003e \n\u003e That’s why a sold-out event gathered hockey fans together in the bowels of Xcel Energy Center before yesterday’s Kings/Wild showdown. Ranging from Kings employees to local Minnesotans, a crowd of around 400 – 500 people showed up for a special evening, the annual Beat Paralysis Gala, held each year in Minnesota.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Jack Jablonski]]\n\u003e This is usually the biggest day of the year for our foundation, it’s a sold-out event and this is our biggest moneymaker so to speak in terms of what we take in annually for donations. For me personally, it’s obviously a grateful day, to see the continued support, not only for myself personally but for the foundation. Everyone who continues to want to help my foundation and I thrive to help people in wheelchairs with spinal injuries. \n\n\u003e Right now a big focus of ours is upper limb function and blatter studies. That has a lot to do with spinal stimulation through electrodes and electricity going into the spinal cord and with tedious therapy and tasks and rehab in terms of function, we work towards improving the lives of people with paralysis in their upper limbs, and also helping to improve the lives of people that have had their bladder affected as well.\n\n\u003e Being able to combine hockey with paralysis research and awareness is something that’s very special and close to my heart. Obviously, it’s two things that are very intertwined in my life and to be able to keep them together for the right cause is something that I don’t take lightly but also I’m very grateful to have the opportunity to do.\n\n\u003e It’s very special to have the Kings and Wild be a part of a night like this. Not only do we have the gala here before the game, but a lot takes place during the game as well. To be able to have the team that I grew up around and loving, as well as the team that I work for and love, is really awesome. Just to have both teams as a part of a night like this, something that we can all celebrate together in terms of focusing in on helping the lives of people with paralysis.\n\n\u003e We’re excited to get that money and be able to take it from donations and put it into clinical trial studies.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/Aatu-Jamsen":{"title":"Aatu Jamsen","content":"\n# Aatu Jamsen\n\n| NHL.com / Ontario Reign | Twitter                                 |\n| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| [Aatu Jamsen]()           | [@twitter_handle](https://twitter.com/) | \n\n| Player | \\#  | Position | Shoots | Height | Weight | Born | Birthplace | Draft |\n| ------ | --- | -------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ---- | ---------- | ----- |\n|        |     |          |        |        |        |      |            |       |\n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n\n\n\n## Post-Draft Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n| 2022-10-21 | [[Kings at NHL.com]] | [[LA Kings Prospect Report, 10-21]]                                                                         |\n\n\n\n## Pre-Draft Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n\n\n## Unprocessed Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/About":{"title":"About","content":"\n# About\n\nThe LA Kings News and Knowledge Graph is an experiment in curating the existing news about the National Hockey League's Los Angeles Kings franchise. \n\n\n## The Goal\nAt several times in my fandom, I've wanted to compare something that someone wrote about a player in the past and what was being written in the present. Where were those pre-draft quotes about the player who was hitting 500 games? But that all seems to evaporate. What I needed was an index to pull insightful stuff out of the source that hosted it. For example, I love listening to [[Mark Yannetti]] discuss amateur player scouting, evaluation, and drafting, which he's done several times in several different podcasts, videos, and written media. But I don't know where it all is and the significant things he said in them to pull out patterns. So this is my attempt to review and index significant media coverage of the Kings.\n\n## The Vision\nI'm sure that different people might find this site interesting for different reasons. For me, I'd love to be able to read coverage on players over time, especially prospects breaking into the league. If someone has a breakout year, it would be fun to read back through the coverage to see if anything emerges during that breakout; It might be interesting to read the prospect profiles from before and immediately post-draft or during development camps and pre-seasons.\n\n## The Details So Far\n- I review coverage manualy and cross-indexed by events, player, staff, and writer. This is all a work in progress so not all of that cross-referencing is complete. I've emphasized cross-referencing articles by player over writer, site, or staff member (There's a list of all [[Quinton Byfield]] article mentions, but not [[Todd McLellan]] mentions or a master list of articles from [[The Athletic]]).\n- I pull out quotes or headers, but not entire articles. I'm not quite sure where to draw the line on that, but I'm not comfortable pulling out anything besides quotes and main talking points right now. The goal is to have enough information to understand if the article is relevant enough to read at some time in the future.\n- A lot of the sources have identical quotes. I'm not sure what to do about that. The goal of this experiment isn't to replace reading the articles, but to serve as a link to them.\n- I've paid to subscribe to sites to read their content if it seems promising. Right now, the list is:\n\t- [[The Athletic]]\n\t- [[The Hockey Tactics Newsletter]]\n\t- ESPN (well, for the streaming games, not the news coverage)\n\t- [[The Forum Report]]\n\t\n\t- I hope others can decide from my indexing whether or not these sources are worth subscribing to.\n- I'm not including AP game summaries from whomever licenses them, for example, the [[LA Times]]. I'm interested in the original coverage or analysis they might provide.\n\n\nDo you think there's a source of Kings news that I'm not adding to the record? \n\nWhat do you think about the experiment in general? I'll think about the best way to leave feedback.\n\n## The Tools\n- I store coverage notes and cross-reference them in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).\n- I publish the notes using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/Action-Network":{"title":"Action Network","content":"\n# Action Network\n\n| URL          | Feed     | Twitter                                |\n| ------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------- |\n| [Homepage]() | [Feed]() | [@twitterHandle](https://twitter.com/) | \n\n\n## Articles\n| Title | Source Link | Date Published |\n| ----- | ----------- | -------------- |\n|       |             |                |\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/Adam-Proteau":{"title":"Adam Proteau","content":"\n# Adam Proteau\n\n| NHL.com | Twitter |\n| ------- | ------- |\n| [Adam Proteau]() | [@twitter_handle](https://twitter.com/)\n\n| Title | Organization |\n| ----- | ------------ |\n|       |              |\n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date | Title |\n| ---- | ----- |\n|      |       |\n\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\n| Date | Title |\n| ---- | ----- |\n|      |       |\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.722381848Z","tags":null},"/Adrian-Kempe":{"title":"Adrian Kempe","content":"\n# Adrian Kempe\n\nNHL.com | Twitter\n-|-\n[Adrian Kempe](https://www.nhl.com/player/adrian-kempe-8477960) | [@adriankempe](https://twitter.com/adriankempe)\n\n| Position         | Shoots | Height | Weight | Age   | Birthday | Birthplace | Draft         |\n| ---------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ----- | -------- | ---------- | ------------- |\n| [[Adrian Kempe]] | 9      | C      | L      | 6' 2\" | 200      | 1996-09-13 | Kramfors, SWE |\n\n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date       | Site                    | Title                                                                                                                                               |\n| ---------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-11-02 | [[The Forum Report]]    | [[Reaction in Dallas -

It was my rookie year too and pretty early on, so it was a good feeling to score all three in the same period, so it was cool and very exciting.\n\n\u003e It always feels good to score in Anaheim, so to get all three was great. We ended up losing in OT, so it kind of sucked \\[with the result] but other than that it was a good feeling.\n\n\u003e I had chances for a hat trick that night.

It was really tough, me and Drew sat on the side, dreading ourselves \\[for not being in there], but it happens and we had to deal with it.\n\n\u003e It was tough, especially for my family and for me, mentally it was really tough. I couldn’t be with my daughter, play with her, that was the toughest part about everything I think. Coming back here, I hadn’t skated, so I started to skate and felt fine and I started to look to the brighter side. I feel confident and we’ll just take it day by day now, see if I can get out of the red jersey.\n\n\u003e It was completely different from what I’m used to. It was a lot of just focusing on what I had to do to be ready and stuff and not a lot of family activities. It was tough at that point, but I was making sacrifices and I’m here now and I feel really good about myself.\n\n\u003e It’s fun, we go way back, we were roommates in Milwaukee. He’s a great guy, a great player. I think a lot of younger guys can learn from him, his skill set and how he wants to get better every day. He’s great, I really, really enjoy having him here.\n\n\u003e I don’t know yet, it’s day by day. We’re just trying to get me back with the players again and we’ll see how it goes\n\n\u003e Yeah, for sure. I didn’t see the games in Ontario the other day, but I feel like [[Gabe Vilardi|Gabe]] has taken a step with his skating and with his control of the puck. Especially offensively, he’s dangerous when he has the puck and he’s creative. Same with [[Quinton Byfield|Q]] and [[Arthur Kaliyev|Arthur]], others too, they made steps the last year and hopefully they continue to grow.\n\n\u003e It was a lot of fun \\[to skate with the full group today]. Just good to be back.\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.726381967Z","tags":null},"/After-years-of-injury-issues-Kings-Gabe-Vilardi-is-flourishing-Los-Angeles-Times":{"title":"After years of injury issues, Kings Gabe Vilardi is flourishing - Los Angeles Times","content":"\n# After years of injury issues, Kings Gabe Vilardi is flourishing - Los Angeles Times\n\n| Date       | Site         | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| ---------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 2022-11-02 | [[LA Times]] | [After years of injury issues, Kings Gabe Vilardi is flourishing - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-11-02/kings-gabe-vilardi-back-injury-scoring-resurgence-anze-kopitar) |\n| 2022-11-02 | [[LA Times]] | [[After years of injury issues, Kings Gabe Vilardi is flourishing - Los Angeles Times]]                                                                                                                      |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Helene Elliott]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e It’s easy to forget, now that Kings forward Gabriel Vilardi is dominating entire shifts and controlling the puck as if it were magnetized to his stick, that a bad back nearly ended his career before it could truly begin.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n- [[Luc Robitaille]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n\u003e There were several months — I wouldn’t say years, but several months — where I wasn’t sure if I was going to be playing hockey for my life, which is pretty scary because it’s all I’d ever known, all I ever wanted to do.\n\n\u003e I think I had more to prove this year. I stay off social media because I don’t like to read it, but I don’t know who was counting me on the team this year, on the starting roster. I just worked hard this summer and I’m just taking the same mentality that I had this summer into the season, and so far it’s been good. But it’s a small sample size. I want to be a good player for a long time.\n\n\u003e I don’t want to say it was a blessing in disguise, because I missed three years and that’s a lot of development, a lot of hockey that I missed, but I do have a better sense of my body, I think.\n\n\u003e They drafted me to be a goal scorer or produce or help put up points. It’s what I’ve always wanted to do and it’s good I’m kind of doing it. I’ve got to produce. That’s my job, at the end of the day.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e With all players, you like to project and hope and all that type of stuff. But the number of setbacks he had, you wondered. But yet, you kept going back to the package and the skill and the talent and the brain and the hands.\n\n### [[Luc Robitaille]]\n\u003e To tell you was there ever any doubt, we didn’t know. We do know that every time he played at \\[minor-league] Ontario he was a dominant player. But at the same time, it takes time.\n\u003e I give the kid credit. His love for the game is the reason he’s where he’s at. You’ve got to really love what you do and not give up, and that’s one big thing about him. He’s got a passion for the game and trying to get better every day.\n\n\u003e The kid was good at training camp. He was good last year at training camp too. He’s had good spurts. I think he’s earned his ice time by the way he’s played and what he’s shown. I’m really happy for him, I’ve got to tell you.\n\n### [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\u003e I remember his skill is through the roof. He’s got to be top in the league in handling the puck in tight spaces. He’s displayed it. And he very rarely loses a stick battle. I knew his skill was always there. His hockey IQ is very exceptional. Yeah, he’s just had a couple bad years with some injuries and we always talk about confidence, which couldn’t have been very high.\n\u003e He’s come to camp with a mission and, like I said, he’s been our best player.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.726381967Z","tags":null},"/Aidan-Dudas":{"title":"Aidan Dudas","content":"\n# Aidan Dudas\n\nNHL.com / Ontario Reign | Twitter\n-|-\n[Aidan Dudas](https://ontarioreign.com/roster/aidan-dudas) | [@twitter_handle](https://twitter.com/)\n\nPlayer | \\# | Position | Shoots | Height | Weight | Born | Birthplace | Draft \n-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-\nAidan Dudas | 47 | F | R | 5' 7\" | 164 | 2000-06-15 | Parry Sound, ON, CAN | LAK 4th RD, 2018 (113th)\n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\n| Date       | Site                 | Title                                                                            |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-11-03 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[REIGN PREVIEW – Ontario at Colorado, 11-3 -

That start goes beyond the two goals he scored last night. It goes beyond the spot on the first power play unit he’s manned early in training camp. It goes beyond the opportunity he’s currently seizing by skating with the second forward line.\n\n## Notes\n### On Attitude\n\n\u003e It looks like he’s having a lot of fun and I think that’s a huge part of it. Give him credit for being enthusiastic and being excited and his teammates love playing with him right now that’s a real good sign. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e When Gabe is having fun, it’s infectious and I think he plays his best hockey when he’s having fun. I think when he’s stressed, or he’s not feeling great about his game, it weighs on him. It feels like he’s in a great headspace \\[right now] and we need that going forward. -- [[Trevor Moore]]\n\n\u003e You can tell his vibes are so positive and he wants to be a game changer. It’s definitely a big difference I’ve seen so far this year and we need him. We need him to be like that and the more players we have like that, the better we’ll be. -- [[Phillip Danault]]\n\n### On Skill\n\n\u003e Gabe has always been a big, strong kid, you can see that when he wins puck battles. He’s working really hard right now and I think it’s showing. The skill has always been there, it’s just a matter of him getting that confidence and doing those little things. -- [[Trevor Moore]]\n\n### On the switch from Center to Wing\n\n\u003e I’ve got to continue to work on \\[the defensive zone], you can always get better with your wall play and that’s important for me when playing as a winger, taking care of my own zone first. I’ve been on the wing for around a year now and I’m still adjusting. I’m going to continue to work and take it day-by-day. -- [[Gabe Vilardi]]","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.726381967Z","tags":null},"/Anatomy-of-a-Draft-Pick-How-the-Kings-Decided-on-Byfield":{"title":"Anatomy of a Draft Pick – How the Kings Decided on Byfield","content":"\n# Anatomy of a Draft Pick – How the Kings Decided on Byfield\n\n| Date       | Site | Link                                                                                                                                                     |\n| ---------- | ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2020-10-07 | [[Mayors Manor]]     | [Anatomy of a Draft Pick – How the Kings Decided on Byfield](https://mayorsmanor.com/2020/10/anatomy-of-a-draft-pick-how-the-kings-decided-on-byfield/)) |\n| 2020-10-07 | [[Mayors Manor]]     | [[Anatomy of a Draft Pick – How the Kings Decided on Byfield]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[John Hoven]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e It seems that nearly every year there is a debate among two players either at or near the top of the NHL Draft board. This year was no exception, with Quinton Byfield vs. Tim Stuetzle being a common theme among prognosticators and fans alike.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n- Tim Stuetzle\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Mark Yannetti]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Mark Yannetti]]\n\u003e It wasn’t a consensus among the staff. It was not like Drew Doughty in 2008. It wasn’t a consensus pick, but it was the right pick because [[Rob Blake|Rob]] wants to build the team a certain way.\n\n\u003e I had two other players in that group at various points this year. It was as much as a group of four for me. For some of the scouts it was a group of three. For [[Christian Ruutu|Ruutu]] it was always a group of one.\n\n\u003e We used live scouting. Among our staff, nine of the scouts saw Byfield play in a live game that wasn’t a prospect game. Seven of our staff saw Stuetzle play in a live game. And at least five of our staff saw multiple live games of each player. The live views are the first component we used, where the results were split.\n\n\u003e Everything is as equal as it can be. From the process, to the format, to what we’re looking for. It was like a NASCAR thing, everything was made to be equal.\n\n\u003e Stuetzle might have been a little ahead in the first round of video. Then, with the analytics, they pointed to Byfield. Then, in the second round of video, things pointed back toward Byfield.\n\n\u003e Regarding the interview process, they’re in the same group. They’re different, but in terms of layering the interview, they’re in the exact same tier – no question. Neither will be a better or worse teammate than the other. One wouldn’t have more drive or desire than the other. They’d be dead even there.\n\n\u003e Byfield has a dynamic personality. Stuetzle makes everybody around him happier.\n\n\u003e The General Manager. Rob Blake has a plan, I can tell you that. It’s a legit plan; I like it, I’m in. That plan means the team is going to be built a certain way. Dean \\[Lombardi] had a plan – the team was going to be built from the backend out; defenseman, center, winger. He defined for us, the team is going to win by doing this, they might not score as many goals, but we’re going to play a possession based style, etc. Dean had a plan. We drafted players — for the most part — to fit his philosophy, to fit Darryl Sutter’s philosophy, to fit Terry Murray’s philosophy. Now, Blakey has a plan. And if two guys are close, whoever fits into the mold of how he wants the team to play becomes the obvious choice. It can be razor thin and the choice can be obvious; or it can be razor thin and the choice can be hard. It’s just circumstance. In this case, while extremely razor thin close between two players, the choice for Byfield was easy because the team is being built a certain way. [[Todd McLellan|Todd]] is going to have the team playing a certain way and Blakey is going to help build the team to play that certain way. And these type of players are going to help Rob and Todd win.\n\n\u003e The scouting staff brings Rob Blake all the information. They bring him the process, the information, and a recommendation. That being said, Rob is the boss and he makes the decision. If the staff presents something completely foreign to what Rob’s decision would want to be, there would be a lot more discussion before we got to the end.\n\n\u003e We said it’s razor thin, but we like Byfield better than player B. Rob didn’t make a decision in that moment either. He took all the information in and then he had the ability to review it at his leisure. A couple weeks later, he told me the direction he wanted to go. Based on how he wants the team to play, it’s easy for me to understand why that was the pick.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.726381967Z","tags":null},"/And-So-It-Begins-Kings-On-Kings-Crime-On-TV-Today":{"title":"And So It Begins – Kings On Kings Crime On TV Today","content":"\n# And So It Begins – Kings On Kings Crime On TV Today\n\n| Date       | Site             | Link                                                                                                                                      |\n| ---------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-22 | [[Mayors Manor]] | [And So It Begins – Kings On Kings Crime On TV Today](https://mayorsmanor.com/2022/10/and-so-it-begins-kings-on-kings-crime-on-tv-today/) |\n| 2022-10-22 | [[Mayors Manor]] | [[And So It Begins – Kings On Kings Crime On TV Today]]                                                                                   |\n\n## Contributors\n- \n\n\n## Summary\n\u003eA few times each junior and college hockey season, Kings fans and management are treated to some \\#KingsOnKingsCrime — and so it begins on Saturday afternoon. \n\n\n## Players\n- [[Jack Hughes]]\n- [[Braden Doyle]]\n- [[Ben Meehan]]\n- [[Kenny Connors]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.726381967Z","tags":null},"/Andre-Lee":{"title":"Andre Lee","content":"\n# Andre Lee\n\n| EliteProspects | Twitter                                 |\n| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| [Andre Lee](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/350001/andre-lee)           | [@twitter_handle](https://twitter.com/) | \n\n| Player        | \\#  | Position | Shoots | Height | Weight | Born       | Birthplace    | Draft                        |\n| ------------- | --- | -------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ---------- | ------------- | ---------------------------- |\n| [[Andre Lee]] | 26  | LW/C     | L      | 6' 4\"  | 205    | 2000-07-26 | Karlstad, SWE | LAK 7th Rd 2019, 188 overall | \n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n|      |      |       |\n\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\n| Date       | Site             | Title                                                                                  |\n| ---------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-29 | [[Mayors Manor]] | [[Ontario Reign - Projected Lineup vs Bakersfield Condors - Several Changes Included]] |\n| 2022-10-27 | [[Mayors Manor]] | [[Reign Recap - Ontario Surge in Standings with Win Over San Jose]]                    |\n| 2022-10-26 | [[Mayors Manor]] | [[Ontario Reign - Projected Lineup at San Jose Barracuda on Wednesday]]                |\n| 2022-10-22 | [[Mayors Manor]] | [[Ontario Reign - Projected Lineup vs San Diego Gulls on Saturday]]                    |\n| 2022-10-21 | [[Mayors Manor]] | [[Ontario Reign - Projected Lineup at San Diego on Friday]]                            |\n\n\n\n## Post-Draft Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n|      |      |       |\n\n\n\n## Pre-Draft Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n|      |      |       |\n\n\n## Unprocessed Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n|      |      |       |\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.726381967Z","tags":null},"/Andrew-Knoll":{"title":"Andrew Knoll","content":"\n# Andrew Knoll\n\n| NHL.com | Twitter |\n| ------- | ------- |\n| [Andrew Knoll]() | [@twitter_handle](https://twitter.com/)\n\n| Title | Organization |\n| ----- | ------------ |\n|       |              |\n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date | Title |\n| ---- | ----- |\n|      |       |\n\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\n| Date | Title |\n| ---- | ----- |\n|      |       |\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.726381967Z","tags":null},"/Angeles-Analysis-A-Tough-Start-and-A-New-Approach-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"Angeles Analysis - A Tough Start and A New Approach - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# Angeles Analysis - A Tough Start and A New Approach - LA Kings Insider\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-14 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [Angeles Analysis - A Tough Start and A New Approach - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/14/angeles-analysis-a-tough-start-a-new-approach/)\n2022-10-14 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[Angeles Analysis - A Tough Start and A New Approach - LA Kings Insider]]\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- \n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e A challenging opening two games at home have left the Kings at 0-2-0, after losses to Vegas and Seattle. For a team that entered the season with expectations to build and grow off of last season’s playoff berth, it’s not the start to the season that anyone had hoped for, though it’s also something that Todd McLellan warned us would be possible. With new expectations, comes a different type of season.\n\nThe team we should be comparing these Kings to is the team at the start of last season, not the one that ended it.\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e As we go forward now, we’ll have to lay game two against game one because now we’re starting to get this year’s evidence. Maybe we’re going to be a loose, gambling, score five per night team and get it done that way, I don’t know, but that looked like how we wanted to play. If we feel as a group that’s where our identity has to go and we’re going to try it that way, great, but I’m not betting on it.

And three extremely exciting wins at that. While the 2022-23 LA Kings haven’t looked identical to the 2021-22 LA Kings, this new version has shown it can win games in a variety of ways. Over the course of this trip, however, we’ve seen certain traits from last season’s team begin to reappear, and these are traits that last season’s team prided itself on, leading to wins over the course of the season.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n- [[Phillip Danault]]\n- [[Trevor Moore]]\n- [[Blake Lizotte]]\n- [[Brendan Lemieux]]\n- [[Cal Petersen]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e We’re going to inevitably have situations like this again throughout the season and we can reach back and know that we’ve done it before.

It all evens out, but we have not had enough practice time. There are reasons why teams don’t practice. One is four mandatory days that the players have off, based on their CBA agreement, which they deserve, they need time off. Then, there’s the travel when we get home at three o’clock in the morning, it’s difficult to get that group up. We talked to some of them and some of them went home and still couldn’t sleep. You wake up, your sleep pattern is broken and you jumped in a car, it was cold the other night, everybody’s wide awake and you’re not getting to bed until 3:30. So. I’m trying to explain why we haven’t practiced a lot. Now, with that being said, the schedule is the schedule and we planned for that and try and get better as much as we can without this skates. We’re adding a few things to pre-game skates when we do skate.\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.726381967Z","tags":null},"/Angeles-Analysis-Next-Stop-Regular-Season-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"Angeles Analysis - Next Stop, Regular Season - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# Angeles Analysis - Next Stop, Regular Season - LA Kings Insider\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-09 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [Angeles Analysis - Next Stop, Regular Season - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/09/angeles-analysis-next-stop-regular-season/)\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n## Players\n- \n\n## Summary\n\u003e Nothing too crazy today, with the team off from practice on a transition day between the preseason and the regular season.

We’ll receive the fate of those two individuals in the morning, with a massive list of players on waivers today from around the league. We’ll receive official clarity on the roster tomorrow, though with those two moves now made, you can pretty much see how the Kings will roll entering Opening Night from a roster standpoint, though you can’t rule out what could happen with waivers or injuries over the next 24 hours.\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.726381967Z","tags":null},"/Angeles-Analysis-The-First-Trip-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"Angeles Analysis - The First Trip - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# Angeles Analysis - The First Trip - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                           |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 2022-10-23 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [Angeles Analysis - The First Trip - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/23/angeles-analysis-the-first-trip/) |\n| 2022-10-23 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[Angeles Analysis - The First Trip - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                       |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings went to the Midwest and the East Coast for five games in eight days, four of which came against teams that qualified for the playoffs a season ago.

Wins on Tuesday and Saturday saw the Kings play as close to the brand of hockey they want to play as we’ve seen all season. Thursday’s defeat was perhaps as frustrating a night as we’ve watched, a defeat that led to the Kings not only expressing the necessity to make changes stylistically, but actually further that by changing their alignment heading into Saturday’s homestand finale, the first real shakeup of the season.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Rasmus Kupari]]\n- [[Sean Walker]]\n- [[Cal Petersen]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e Even that might have been different from well, he was a lot cleaner.

The word, of course, is confidence.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e I’m going to use that the C word again, confidence. He feels good about himself, we feel good about putting him on the ice and when you feel good about yourself and you believe in yourself and everybody else does too, it’s magic sometimes. He’s done an outstanding job, I don’t know what else I can say. It’s confidence and him feeling good.\n\n\u003e There are others that we’ve tried that with and they haven’t taken advantage of it, but \\[[[Gabe Vilardi]]] is the one guy that has done it. I think if the players are honest, they’ll tell you that they feel it when the coach believes in them or trust them. We tried to create that right off the bat with him.\n\n\u003e We talked about giving \\[[[Gabe Vilardi]]] a really good opportunity, as much as you possibly can, throughout the exhibition season to try to get him into situations where he feels good about himself and the team feels good about him. We tried that and he took advantage of it.\n\n\u003e It’s really refreshing to see him walk into the rink, he’s sticking his chest out a little, he’s smiling more, he seems to be enjoying the whole package and that’s great. He’s earned the opportunity to feel that way and as a result he’s playing that way.\n\n\u003e We have people in the organization that help all of us, including me, when we talk about pressure and what what we feel sometimes. We \\[as coaches] can help him as much as we possibly can, but there are others, it’s the training staff, teammates, other people on staff that that help all of us with that.\n\n### [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n\u003e I think I had more to prove this year. With social media, I don’t like to read it, but I don’t know who was kind of counting me on the team this year, on the starting roster. I just worked hard this summer and I’ve taken the same mentality into the season. So far it’s been good, but small sample size, I want to be a good player for a long time\n\n\u003e I don’t know about that, that’s pretty cool to hear coming from \\[[[Anze Kopitar]]], I mean he’s the best player hands down. If he’s saying that it’s good, it means I’ve got to keep going and help them out and just try to produce as a line.\n\n### [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\u003e It’s easy to be hard on yourself when things aren’t going well, it’s easy to spiral a bit and that’s probably the biggest thing in an 82-game season, is keeping steady. Not going too high, not going too low and it seems like he’s figured that out. It’s great to see.\n\n\u003e best player right now, hands down\n\n### [[Adrian Kempe]]\n\u003e I think it was good and sometimes it’s good to mix the lines up and get some good chemistry going, some new energy on the line. Gabe did a great job \\[yesterday], he’s good on pucks and he’s good down low. He got a goal too, so that’s good for him and for us.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.726381967Z","tags":null},"/Arthur-Kaliyev":{"title":"Arthur Kaliyev","content":"\n# Arthur Kaliyev\n\nNHL.com | Twitter\n-|-\n[Arthur Kaliyev](https://www.nhl.com/player/arthur-kaliyev-8481560) | [@Arthur_Kaliyev](https://twitter.com/Arthur_Kaliyev)\n\nPosition | Shoots | Height | Weight | Age | Birthday | Birthplace | Draft\n-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-\nRW | L | 6'2\" | 210 | 21 | 2001-06-26 | Tashkent, UZB | 2019 LAK, 2nd rd, 2nd pk (33rd overall)\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date       | Site                  | Title                                                                                                                         |     |\n| ---------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |\n| 2022-11-05 | [[Kings at NHL.com]]  | [[LA Kings vs Florida Panthers -

This is an old plane, and most of the planes I enjoy flying have the latest technological improvements and bulkhead maintenance, but this one’s are suspect, and after a reboot of a faulty internet (and entertainment systems), we were up and running with the world at our fingertips. Notes from a travel day ahead of an interesting five-gamer:\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e I was thinking about it for a while. After the first couple shifts, I just wanted to talk to my dad, talk to my mom, see what they thought. It was special to see them. That meant the world to me that they were out here this whole week.  -- [[Brandt Clarke]] \n\n\u003e It’s pretty cool, you’re just thinking about it. It’s officially forever now – I’ve played in the NHL, so it’s a really cool feeling.  -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e It’s different. But it’s still cool because I still have all my family and friends there, which is most important. But Joe Lewis has obviously has a vibe that can’t be matched, really. It’s cool. The rink is beautiful, it’s nice, I’m excited to go back.  -- [[Matt Roy]]\n\n\u003e It’s hard to see everyone I want to see, but I just think I’m going to keep it close with direct family and maybe have a couple guys over for dinner.  -- [[Matt Roy]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.726381967Z","tags":null},"/Austin-Stanovich":{"title":"Austin Stanovich","content":"\n# Austin Stanovich\n\n| NHL.com | Twitter |\n| ------- | ------- |\n| [Austin Stanovich]() | [@twitter_handle](https://twitter.com/)\n\n| Title | Organization |\n| ----- | ------------ |\n|       |              |\n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date | Title |\n| ---- | ----- |\n|      |       |\n\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\n| Date | Title |\n| ---- | ----- |\n|      |       |\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.726381967Z","tags":null},"/Austin-Wagner":{"title":"Austin Wagner","content":"\n# Austin Wagner\n\n| NHL.com / Ontario Reign | Twitter                                 |\n| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| [Austin Wagner]()           | [@twitter_handle](https://twitter.com/) | \n\n| Player | \\#  | Position | Shoots | Height | Weight | Born | Birthplace | Draft |\n| ------ | --- | -------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ---- | ---------- | ----- |\n|        |     |          |        |        |        |      |            |       |\n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date       | Site                  | Title                                                          |\n| ---------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-29 | [[Pro Hockey Rumors]] | [[Los Angeles Kings Recall Rasmus Kupari]]                     |\n| 2022-10-25 | [[Mayors Manor]]      | [[Projected Lineup -

Coming into camp, for sure some confidence right off the bat with both [[Brendan Lemieux|Pep]] and [[Carl Grundstrom|Grundy]] too actually, I played a few games with him last year so we kind of knew what he brought to the table. Right from the get go, it’s been really comfortable. --[[Blake Lizotte]]\n\n\u003e Yeah, I would say that they’ve become a pair. I thought both of them missed each other when they were hurt last year, for different reasons, but I do see them being a pair. They’re wired in completely different ways, Pep is a big personality, [[Blake Lizotte|Lizzo]] is a little more of a quiet personality, but it blends well and that’s the personal part of it. The on-ice part, they both play that tenacious style of hockey, they enjoy forechecking, they don’t have to be cute. Pretty straight and direct production from them and I think they push each other too, they keep each other honest and they push each other.  -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e I think Grunny is as skilled as a depth player as I’ve played with and I’ve played with a few highly skilled ones. He makes a lot of really good plays, he’s got great hands and a terrific shot, but I love the simplicity that his game has and I think that’s when he’s at his best. He’s got two guys that complement that simplicity well, but it’s nice to have the guy you know you can get the puck too and he can beat someone 1-on-1 or he can make a backhand sauce pass right on the tape. A lot of guys who play in those bottom six roles don’t have the ability to do that, so it’s an ideal line. -- [[Brendan Lemieux]]\n\n\u003e I think he’s gotten better every year, he’s shown that he’s very capable of playing in high pressure situations, in playoffs last year. Even leading up to that, yeah he wasn’t in the lineup for a couple of nights but there were other reasons for that. We think he can be a full-time player and be an effective full-time player. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003eI think Grundy brings a different element to Pep and my games, he’s shown so far in preseason that his skill has grown and he’s become more of a complete player, especially in the d-zone. He’s a workhorse, Pep and I have both already talked about it and there’s no shortage of work on our line. It’s really nice to have a guy that’s willing to get in there in the trenches with us. It seems like it’s been clicking so far in camp. -- [[Blake Lizotte]]\n\n\u003e Grunny has a little bit more forechecking and a little bit more skating to his game, a little bit more speed in the tighter areas. It’s a bit different, but it actually makes Lizzo and my loads easier as far as skating, it helps us conserve a little bit of energy so that it can be used for more forechecking and more offense. It’s just a different look, you know, Arty is a pure shooter he likes to be high, in different areas and Grunny likes to be lower, in the paint and around the net and digging pucks. It’s a different look but it’s obviously one that works whether we play with Arty, Grunny or not together. I think our games always try to stay the same. -- [[Brendan Lemieux]]\n\n\u003e It’s been pretty good, I played a little bit with \\[Lizotte] last year too, so I kind of knew what to expect and we’re finding each other well so far, so it’s been good. All of us want to play North-South and play directly. I think that fits us really, really well to play that way. -- [[Carl Grundstrom]]\n\n\u003e We think Grunny complements \\[Lizotte and Lemieux]. They play, I call it a hunt game, they’re on top of teams, creating turnovers, buzzing, physicality and momentum. It can be really effective, we do trust them defensively, they do good job there. We believe they can be a real good line but when it really gets going, they’re going to have to live up to that. They’re very capable of it. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.726381967Z","tags":null},"/Blake-excited-about-3C-slot-for-Byfield-as-Kopitar-and-Danault-and-Matthews-provide-influence":{"title":"Blake excited about 3C slot for Byfield as Kopitar and Danault – and Matthews – provide influence","content":"\n# Blake excited about 3C slot for Byfield as Kopitar and Danault – and Matthews – provide influence\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-13 | [[The Forum Report]] | [Blake excited about 3C slot for Byfield as Kopitar and Danault – and Matthews – provide influence](https://theforumreport.com/blake-excited-about-3c-slot-for-byfield-as-kopitar-and-danault-and-matthews-provide-influence/)\n2022-10-13 | [[The Forum Report]] | [[Blake excited about 3C slot for Byfield as Kopitar and Danault – and Matthews – provide influence]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jon Rosen]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n- [[Phillip Danault]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e It’s about time to stop talking about the Iafallo-Byfield-Vilardi line’s performance Tuesday night, but there was one loose end to stitch, and that was the visibility of Quinton Byfield on the backcheck.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e I get to see that first hand every day, every game. There are a lot of guys. Even \\[Auston] Matthews has developed that game, as well. I watch a lot of his games. Bergeron’s obviously won a bunch of Selkes.  -- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\n\u003e Just where he sits in the lineup is what we’re excited about and allowing him to become the player he \\[is]. He had a tough injury that set him back \\[last season], but both times he’s come into camp ready to go, and looked to us like he could earn that spot, and he’ll get his chance there now.  -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\u003e “I think we’re all pretty big bodies, skate well. I think most of our forecheck, we got on ‘em early \\[Tuesday], stripping pucks. Gabe, he’s hot right now, he has crazy skill, and I think \\[we] have chemistry from playing in the AHL, as well. I think we fit in pretty well, and Al can play anywhere.  -- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.726381967Z","tags":null},"/Braden-Doyle":{"title":"Braden Doyle","content":"\n# Braden Doyle\n\n| NHL.com / Ontario Reign | Twitter                                 |\n| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| [Braden Doyle]()           | [@twitter_handle](https://twitter.com/) | \n\n| Player | \\#  | Position | Shoots | Height | Weight | Born | Birthplace | Draft |\n| ------ | --- | -------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ---- | ---------- | ----- |\n|        |     |          |        |        |        |      |            |       |\n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n\n\n\n## Post-Draft Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n| 2022-10-22 | [[Mayors Manor]] | [[And So It Begins – Kings On Kings Crime On TV Today]]                                                                                   |\n\n\n\n## Pre-Draft Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n\n\n## Unprocessed Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.726381967Z","tags":null},"/Brandt-Clarke":{"title":"Brandt Clarke","content":"\n# Brandt Clarke\n\nNHL.com | Twitter\n-|-\n[Brandt Clarke]() | [@twitter_handle](https://twitter.com/)\n\nPlayer | \\# | Position | Shoots | Height | Weight | Born | Birthplace | Draft \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---\nBrandt Clarke | 92 | RD | R | 6' 2\" | 185 | 2003-02-09 | Nepean, ON, CAN | 2021 LAK, 1st rd, 8th pk (8th overall)\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date       | Site                    | Title                                                                                                                                               |\n| ---------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-11-05 | [[The Forum Report]]    | [[When Gudas put ink to paper with the Kings -

It is the lap in which teammates send that player out to the ice first and all alone for the warm-up skate before they join him.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e I had put on my jersey, and I was reaching up for my gear. My gloves were up there (on a shelf) and the guys were yelling across the room, ‘Don’t even think about it. Don’t even try.’ I didn’t put it on.  -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e I just felt like it took forever to be honest with you. Probably to you guys, it’s like 10 seconds. To me, it felt like five minutes. I was just out there with all those eyes on me. I think I didn’t stop smiling for like five minutes into warm-up.\n\u003e It was a good feeling. I saw my parents right away. I looked up to where they were sitting. They were there with smiles on their faces and their phone out and stuff like that. It’s a moment I’ll never forget.  -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e There’s enough that’s going on in their world right now. First game. Family in town. We don’t want to overburden him with details. We want him to play the game. We want him to enjoy the process. I think the less he has on his mind and more instinctual hockey, the better chance he has for success.\n\u003e We haven’t sat with him and gone through everything and what to expect and what not to expect. If he comes to us, we’ll certainly help him. But we’ll leave him alone.  -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e This is the moment I have dreamt of for so long. I’ve been watching the NHL for my entire life and now that I’m officially going to be in it, it’s kind of crazy to think. This is going to be something I never forget. It’s pretty cool.  -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e He’s fine penalty-killing. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e We’re shorthanded for four of the first 6 1/2 minutes of the game,. Once we settled in, that allowed Brandt to play a little bit more.  -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e Definitely first couple of shifts, the puck was on my stick too long. Every time I turned, there was one of their offensive players coming to lay a body check on me. It as definitely a wake-up call right away. The puck’s got to move quick. Got to know where everyone is on the ice. I think I adapted pretty well throughout the game, and it was crisper later in the game. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e I came into the room, and I was like, ‘Wow'. Every time I had the puck, no one brushed by me or anything (and) you’re not getting laid out but they’re finishing on you. It’s just something you got to get adjusted to as well. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e It was a good feeling. To be relied on in that situation. That’s what they wanted. They wanted a spark of offense, and they trusted it in our hands. We tried and made some good plays at the blue line. Drew’s obviously Drew. He’s smart with the puck and got shots through. I’m just trying to make some play to get the puck in his hands. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e We dressed six defensemen tonight. I know he wasn’t (a) 6. Pretty sure he wasn’t 5. And I don’t believe he was 4 either. That’s what I thought of him. I thought he had a real good night.\n\u003e Didn’t hurt us at all defensively. Creative offensively. I’d like to see him shoot the puck a little bit because I think he’s got a great shot. Loves to pass but he had some real good looks at the net where he could have shot the puck. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e I thought my third period was my best period. Personally, you don’t want to say your happy because we lost and it leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. But I’m definitely happy that I got that first one out of the way and I’m just going to try to keep progressing from here. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.726381967Z","tags":null},"/Breakout-Candidates-in-the-Pacific-Division":{"title":"Breakout Candidates in the Pacific Division","content":"\n# Breakout Candidates in the Pacific Division\n\n| Date       | Site                | Link                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| ---------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-06 | [[The Hockey News]] | [Breakout Candidates in the Pacific Division](https://thehockeynews.com/news/breakout-candidates-in-the-pacific-division#:~:text=LOS%20ANGELES%20KINGS%3A-,QUINTON%20BYFIELD,-%2C%20C) |\n| 2022-10-06 | [[The Hockey News]] | [[Breakout Candidates in the Pacific Division]]                                                                                                                                        |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Tony Ferrari]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The second overall pick in the 2020 NHL draft was set to take on a bigger role with the Kings last year before a fractured ankle in a pre-season game derailed his season.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.726381967Z","tags":null},"/Brendan-Lemieux":{"title":"Brendan Lemieux","content":"\n# Brendan Lemieux\n\nNHL.com / Ontario Reign | Twitter\n-|-\n[Brendan Lemieux](https://www.nhl.com/player/brendan-lemieux-8477962) | [@blemieux22](https://twitter.com/blemieux22)\n\nPlayer | \\# | Position | Shoots | Height | Weight | Born | Birthplace | Draft \n-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-\nBrendan Lemieux | 48 | LW | L | 6' 1\" | 215 | 1996-03-15 | Denver, CO, USA | 2014 BUF, 2nd rd, 1st pk (31st overall)\n\n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date       | Site                  | Title                                                                                                                     |\n| ---------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-11-05 | [[LA Kings Insider]]    | [[11-5 Preview -

More Todd McLellan quotes that perked my ears up in a moment. \n\n\n## Players\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e I don’t think that anything’s going to change as far as roster personnel from now until tomorrow, but there could be a lineup change.\n\n\u003e Kopi’s line, and I’m not putting all on Kevin by any means, has been out-chanced the majority of games they’ve played in, and we can’t keep going that route, so Gabe will play there tomorrow. I think Gabe can make some of the plays that Kevin makes, as well. But we try and stabilize lines and maybe it’ll help Kevin with some other linemates, as well.\n\n\u003e It’s what that line is doing outside the blue line, neutral zone, D zone, that has to get a little bit better. And that’s not on Fiala completely. It’s the whole group on the ice.\n\n\u003e Bantam coaches are using this type of language.\n\u003e Sometimes you’ve got to punt and wait to get the ball back. Right now, our decision of punting is forcing stuff and it’s coming back to bite us.\n\n\u003e When we look at the past, Olli Maatta is basically the one guy that left our team and had some size. Stech was here for a little bit, but he wasn’t a very big man. We’re probably bigger on the blue line this year than we were last year with Drew being back. Clarkie’s a 6-foot-2 guy. We’re bigger there now, so it’s not lack of size, it’s just getting it done.\n\n\u003e If there’s any way the spirit of a group can get destroyed is giving up chances over and over again on a power play. Your mindset goes to offense completely. You forget there’s a checking element to a power play as well. You tend to cheat a bit because you’re supposed to be in an offensive situation, and that’s what hurt us \\[Thursday night], so we talked about fixing that because we believe we’d earn another power play or two and getting back to work. Even in the second period we never gave up our first chance until the midway mark. So we recovered well, we just consistently don’t stay with it.\n\n\u003e We will meet as a group over the next day or two. This morning, the last thing we talked about this morning was whether \\[[[Brandt Clarke]]] would be staying with the club or not. I know that \\[decision’s] coming. I don’t have that answer for you because we haven’t had that discussion.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.726381967Z","tags":null},"/CBS-Sports":{"title":"CBS Sports","content":"\n# CBS Sports\n\n| URL          | Feed     | Twitter                                |\n| ------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------- |\n| [Homepage]() | [Feed]() | [@twitterHandle](https://twitter.com/) | \n\n\n## Articles\n| Title | Source Link | Date Published |\n| ----- | ----------- | -------------- |\n|       |             |                |\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/CBS-Sports-Kings-Gabriel-Vilardi-Practices-on-top-line":{"title":"CBS Sports - Kings Gabriel Vilardi - Practices on top line","content":"\n# CBS Sports - Kings Gabriel Vilardi - Practices on top line\n\n| Date       | Site           | Link                                                                                                                                                     |\n| ---------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-28 | [[CBS Sports]] | [CBS Sports - Kings Gabriel Vilardi - Practices on top line](https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/hockey/news/kings-gabriel-vilardi-practices-on-top-line/) |\n| 2022-10-28 | [[CBS Sports]] | [[CBS Sports - Kings Gabriel Vilardi - Practices on top line]]                                                                                           |\n\n## Contributors\n- Rotowire Staff\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Vilardi practiced on the top line Friday.

I know more about doing a lot of activation stuff, before a practice, before a game. Making sure you’re firing the right muscles, that you’re not overusing your back, that your glutes (gluteal muscles) and core are activated. I’ve brought it here to Kingston and it helps a lot.\n\n\u003eI was in L.A. the whole summer with one of the best staffs I’ve ever worked with. It was really tough some days, like the first few weeks. One day you’d feel strength coming back; the next day you’re really tired. It’s much better, I’m finding much more consistency in my game. I’ve been through injuries before and it’s a process. \n\n\u003e They got me here to score goals and make plays in the offensive zone. I’m just trying to play my game, whatever that involves on any given night.\n\n\u003e We have some really skilled hockey players here. Three good lines almost every night, good defence, (Carolina Hurricanes draft choice Jeremy) Helvig in goal. It’s just a matter of developing chemistry, getting to know each other a little more, like when we spend time on the road.\n\n\u003e Being here I get to stay with my family, which is great. I left when I was 14 and that was tough. I know not too many people get the opportunity to play junior hockey in their hometown and I’m having fun so far.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/Cal-Petersen":{"title":"Cal Petersen","content":"\n# Cal Petersen\n\nNHL.com | Twitter\n-|-\n[Cal Petersen]() | [@twitter_handle](https://twitter.com/)\n\n| Player | \\#  | Position | Shoots | Height | Weight | Born | Birthplace | Draft |\n| ------ | --- | -------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ---- | ---------- | ----- |\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date       | Site                    | Title                                                                                                                                               |\n| ---------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-11-05 | [[The Athletic]]        | [[Each NHL teams biggest concern a month into the 2022-23 season, from ‘everything to ‘too good to tank]]                    |\n| 2022-11-04 | [[ESPN]]                | [[NHL Power Rankings -

Good for us to have a few of those right now. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e Kevin and I have had a lot of climate changes over the years. -- [[Dean Evanson]]\n\n\u003e We played better in the preseason, I think. I can see our line will be very effective, and I think tonight will be the night. -- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n\u003e That’s a true quality of his.\n\u003e I think by this point he understand our demeanor. When I say, ‘ours,’ our coaching staff. But also his teammates – who’s emotional, who isn’t, what gets guys riled up, what’s the boiling point between good and bad? And often for a player, once that gets clarified, it’s a lot easier. … But it is way more about the Kings than it is Kevin tonight. I wish it was the other way, but it just isn’t. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/Cameron-Gaunce":{"title":"Cameron Gaunce","content":"\n#

allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n\u003e Q: today was day one of of camp but you\nguys have been skating together now for\na little while\num what's the familiarity with with\neverybody and how nice was it to kind of\nstart to see a little bit more of the\ngroup form as the king starts to\nofficially cut down their roster a\nlittle bit \n\u003e A: I think today was great uh\nlast couple days we've been skating and\nit's relatively similar group so that\nlike you said the familiarity was\nkind of already there but it's nice to\nbe officially part of it we went back to\nour original numbers in the American\nHockey League guys are more\nuh present if you will because again\nwhen you're still considered big-league guys\nare there's more longing for the\npotential to obey there obviously is\nstill the\nkind of the thought they want to get\ncalled up you want to get brought back\nbut you also know that right now the\nrealities are set in a bit and that's\nwhen you can start to really focus on\nyour present really focus on where you\nare at the time being and I thought that\nhappened I think Marco, heider, and Schulz\nhave been doing an excellent job of\nstaying with us staying on top of us\nmaking sure we understand that we're the\nOntario Reign right now and I thought\ntoday was a great first\nstep \n\n\u003e Q: what's your impressions of Marco\nstarting to get to know him a little bit\nbetter I know he's not a new coach for a\nlot of guys they've had familiarity but\nyou know what have you seen him do\nthat's maybe a little bit different\nwhat's his style so far that you've seen\n\u003e A: uh I feel like he's extremely organized\nwhich I love uh like we've already had a\nfew conversations about a few dates down\nthe road and I absolutely loved\ntop of things has a plan in place so\nthere's no questioning any of that stuff\nthat again it's not to say that Chris\nheide last year didn't have the same thing\nbut it's just different coming from a\nnew voice uh he's been the other thing\nthat you notice right away and talking\nwith Marco is a very caring person and I\nthink especially in the American Hockey League\nthat's very key to the players\nunderstand that the coach not only cares\nabout winning and his own career when he\ncarries with the player uh where some\ndisconnect can sometimes go on when\nplayers are thinking no one's\nlooks like Marco really cares about each\nand every one of us it's present and\nit's something that just adds to the\noverall experience as him as a coach\n\n\u003e Q: you've been around this league for for a\nwhile now how do you feel like the\ntalent level is on this roster maybe\nwhen you when you see at the beginning\nof the year I know that last year the\nteam felt like they had a lot of talent\ntoo but when you look at you know some\nof the new pieces that have been added\nin some new faces where do you feel like\nthe talent level of the roster is at? \n\u003e A: I\nthink the talent level is high like again it's we\ndon't have the full roster right yet\nwith with the Kings still having a few\nguys which means we're gonna be getting\neven more talented players so it's we're at\na stage already where we've got a team\nthat can compete and I think adding a\ncouple more guys from  the Kings will just\nkind of push us over that top the best\nthing about the American Hockey League\non any given day your roster could be\ncompletely overhauled we went one\nweekend last year with one forward\nplaying defense along with three\ncall-ups and we only had five of us so\nthe next two weekends later we had 8 D, we\nhad too many so it can change in the\nblink of an eye due to injuries call-ups\nthings beyond our control so it's it's\nhard not to look into the future you\nwant to kind of see the type of Team you\ncan put together but you have to worry\nabout the team you have the team we have\nright now is a good team we can\nabsolutely compete and with the systems\nthat we have in place the better we play\nthem the better we're going to be as a\ngroup \n\n\u003e Q: for you why'd you make the\ndecision to come back you know what are\nsome of the factors that that went into\nthat decision and how excited are you\nfor for a new slate your new season\n\u003e A: I was excited at the opportunity to come\nback just because of my career I bounced\naround quite\nit's going to be my third year with the\nsame organization what's going\nfamiliarity as we talked about the first\nquestion it's something that was very\nimportant for me like I come in this\nseason the coaching staff already knows\nexactly who I am as a person who I am as\na player so we already have that we\nalready have that piece of this they\nknow what to expect from me they I know\nwhat to expect from them I understand my\nrole on and off the ice and that just\nmakes me more comfortable than my\nability to grow is that much more now\nthat the basis is down my ability to\ngrow as both the personal player is more\nI'm more capable to do that so I think\nthat was the biggest thing was just\ncoming back being part of the\norganization feeling wanted uh because\nagain someone like myself\nthere's times you just want to feel\nrelevant you want to feel like you're\nwanted this was an organization that\nexpressed want and that was something\nthat I really enjoyed \n\n\u003e Q: last thing this is\na bit of a condensed Camp you only have\na few days you get one preseason game\nand then all of a sudden next week\nyou're going to be gearing up for the\nhome opener already so what are some of\nthe things that that you feel that the\nteam needs to work on in these days to\nmake sure they're ready to start the\nseason and have a good start \n\u003e A: I think\nmaking sure that things that\nthere's certain tenets that we're really trying to harp on \nthat's the key obviously you can start\nbuilding on a few other things but if we\ncan really start\ncoming together as a group in terms of\nunderstanding where each other going to\nbe we need to be a predictable team like\nobviously we've got a guy like [[T.J. Tynan|Tynan]]\nhe's unpredictable because he's that\ngood but not everyone can play like like\ntimes so if we can become more\npredictable as a group earlier on like\nthis week\nstarting coming in this upcoming weekend\nand then moving into the opening slate\nof games without predictability can just\nmake you play better within it because\nthen all of a sudden things start\nhappening quicker that's where teams\nthat's where the term Pace really comes\ninto play I\nplays with pace is one that knows what's\nhappening with each other moving the\nfast skating fastest paces and just\nskating fast because if that was the\ncase we've got [[Austin Wagner]] who's\nfastest skater of the league\nbut playing with pace is playing as a\ngroup moving in five man units and\nunderstanding where each other they're\ngoing to be so the better we can do that\nearlier on I think the more successful I\nwould start of the year because you\ncan't win the season you can't win the\nregular season in the opening month but\nyou can put yourself in a big hole.\n\u003e Cameron thanks very much for joining us\nand we look forward to talking to you\nthroughout the season of course anytime","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/Capitals-score-four-in-third-period-to-get-past-Kings":{"title":"Capitals score four in third period to get past Kings","content":"\n# Capitals score four in third period to get past Kings\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                           |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-22 | [[Kings at NHL.com]] | [Capitals score four in third period to get past Kings](https://www.nhl.com/news/los-angeles-kings-washington-capitals-game-recap/c-336231912) |\n| 2022-10-22 | [[Kings at NHL.com]] | [[Capitals score four in third period to get past Kings]]                                                                                      |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Harvey Valentine]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Marcus Johansson scored the go-ahead goal with 5:25 remaining in the third period, and the Washington Capitals rallied to defeat the Los Angeles Kings 4-3 at Capital One Arena on Saturday.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n- [[Trevor Moore]]\n- [[Alex Edler]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e You look at it at 3-2, but then obviously the last two, the \\[6-1 loss at] Pittsburgh (on Thursday), we weren't real pleased with.

We saw it today – they did a really good job of it. Gave up very few outnumbered rushes. We were pretty solid defensively, good through the neutral zone. We did a lot of things well tonight. We didn’t get the win. Sometimes bounces go against you, and I think that’s what happened in overtime to Kev in front of the net.\n\n\u003e Good players make other players around him better, and I see that In \\[[[Kevin Fiala]]]’s situation. He creates. Carl Grundstrom should’ve had a goal tonight after a tremendous pass from Kevin. He makes other players better, he keeps a lot of plays alive, very creative. He’s starting to figure out our system and our structure a little bit more, so he’s a hell of a player.\n\n\u003e I don’t think we had enough polish as we’ve shown offensively. Some real good opportunities where we bobbled pucks, we had chances at breakaways, the two-on-ones, missed the net or we didn’t make the right play. The one thing that’s coming for us has been the offense, and tonight it let us down a little bit.\n\u003e The NHL’s all about winning games. They all balance out at the end, but I thought tonight we may have deserved a better fate but didn’t get it.\n\n### [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\u003e Goals. We wouldn’t find goals today, you know?

When you’re doing a contract negotiation, it’s not really one deal and you’re set on negotiating on that. It’s term, money, all that stuff and that was the first time I realized it was that much of a discussion. Like I said, I’m not Drew Doughty and I can’t just walk in there and go ask for whatever I want. It was a process, there were a lot of different options on the table and I’m really happy with what we got done. -- [[Sean Durzi]]\n\n\u003e Those guys came in and did an amazing job and they earned their keep, so that’s good for us,. The left side is not something that’s completely new to me and Royzie and I actually came up together and played in Ontario together and I was on the leftt side there, so it’s not super foreign to me. It’s just about reps and getting comfortable with it all over again, just kind of like everything right now. -- [[Sean Walker]]\n\n\u003e There are certain aspects of it, the o-zone for one, where I feel more comfortable walking off the wall. In the neutral zone, you’ve got to work with just some different aspects being a righty playing on the opposite side. There wil be some things that we figured out along the way, but I think it’s a really good opportunity for us to be really successful on the back end. -- [[Sean Walker]]\n\n\u003e Not everybody likes playing \\[their off side] and I’m all about comfort, I don’t want to put guys into situations to fail. If they’re not comfortable playing their off side, I’m not going to play him on that off side. With Walks, this is my fourth year here and he’s shown the ability to play both sides and not be affected by it too much. Durz is another one who has emerged into that role. You’ve got to play with the hand that you’re dealt, and that’s kind of what we have in our organization. -- [[Trent Yawney]]\n\n\u003e We have a plethora of right-handed defenseman, which isn’t a bad thing. If someone is going to play on the left, it’s making sure you find the right guy and make sure he’s paired with the right guy, and it works the other way too. There are lots of guys that play on their off side and like I said, it’s more about comfort. For some guys, it just doesn’t feel right and you notice it right away, so I’ll usually just pull the plug on that real quick. -- [[Trent Yawney]]\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/Day-12-Primer-Groupings-+-McLellan-on-roster-cutdown-and-waivers":{"title":"Day 12 Primer – Groupings + McLellan on roster cutdown and waivers","content":"\n# Day 12 Primer – Groupings + McLellan on roster cutdown and waivers\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-03 | [[LA Kings Insider]] |  [Day 12 Primer – Groupings + McLellan on roster cutdown \u0026 waivers](http://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/03/day-12-primer-groupings-mclellan-on-roster-cutdown-waivers/)\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n## Players\n- \n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings are back on the ice this morning to begin the homestretch of training camp. With the final week before what is called camp becomes practice, the Kings hit the ice in two groups once again, with a potential roster cutdown on the horizon.\n\n## Notes\n- [[Quinton Byfield]] is day-to-day with an illness\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e Our American League team is going to begin camp \\[this week], so I think at that point, you’ll probably see a large group of players assigned to the Ontario Reign. The luxury of having your own \\[AHL] team here right now is that we’re all in the same training camp, we’re sharing a facility. Players have already found homes, they know they’re going to play on one of the two teams and were progressing as one big group. We’ve divided the group with a little bit of forward thinking in mind, if you will, so the official transcript if that’s what you’re looking for may come fairly early this week.\n\n\u003e When we look at some of the other lines, there are players that we wanted to keep together there so now, we look at what’s leftover, we put them together and all three are battling for positions. All three are utility guys, where they can move around from position to position and I thought all three had good nights. The evaluation will continue tomorrow in practice and the day after and the day after. You know, the unfortunate thing is not everybody can play, we’re only allowed like everybody else so many roster spots and it’s a cruel thing, but that’s a fact of pro sports. Somebody is going to be here and somebody won’t and they’ll sort themselves out as time goes on.\n\n\u003e That would be a much better question for Rob and the management group, on waiver timing, who goes when and what triggers it. I’m not privy to that, we’ll talk about who we may want to keep and who we don’t keep, but as far as timing goes and what not, my experience is that every team is concerned about losing players on waivers at this time of the year, that 32 of them. Again, not everybody can play, you only get 23 spots so inevitably, some players have to be waived.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/Day-14-Primer-The-Split":{"title":"Day 14 Primer – The Split","content":"\n# Day 14 Primer – The Split\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-05 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [Day 14 Primer – The Split](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/05/day-14-primer-the-split/)\n\n## Contributors:\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n## Players\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings group has been reduced to 34 skaters, though we’re seeing a group with fewer individuals truly in action with the Kings when factoring in injuries and illnesses.\n\n## Notes\n\u003e [[Todd McLellan]] has said in past years that he prefers a smaller group when working with his regular NHL roster, designed to maximize repititions and minimize standing around during drills.\n\n\u003e No [[Quinton Byfield]] on the ice this morning, who is labeled as day-to-day with an illness.\n\n- [[Ontario Reign]] training camp opens with a 25-person roster\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/Day-15-Primer-The-Finale-+-Roster-Moves":{"title":"Day 15 Primer – The Finale + Roster Moves","content":"\n# Day 15 Primer – The Finale + Roster Moves\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-07 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [Day 15 Primer – The Finale + Roster Moves](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/07/day-15-primer-the-finale-roster-moves/)\n2022-10-07 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[Day 15 Primer – The Finale + Roster Moves]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n## Players\n- \n\n## Summary\n\u003eConsider today to be the final day of camp, Insiders. \n\u003e \\[...]  The next time the Kings practice, the friendly confines of camp are behind us and the real deal is upon us.\n\n## Notes\n- [[Lias Andersson]] passed through waivers and was assigned to the [[Ontario Reign]].\n- Assigned to the [[Ontario Reign]]:\n\t- [[Samuel Fagemo]]\n\t- [[T.J.

While nothing is set in stone, and we’ll expect to see select players shuffled up and down between Group A and Group B, today was our first real look at a true split between players targeted for the NHL and players targeted for the AHL. Group B consisted of five lines and nine defensemen, all of whom are players who are expected to at the very least compete for a full-time roster spot.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e Cal received treatments today, we don’t think it’s anything serious but it’s obviously something we don’t want to fool around with, he would be day-to-day. We’re not anticipating a long injury, but who knows….Durzi is getting close to joining our group, I assume, and he’s starting to extend his rehab into more contact. Arvidsson is doing really well, still some time and Turcotte is working hard to get back, he’s feeling better. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e I want to play every game, that’s my goal for this year,” he said earlier today. “That’s the goal at least, to prove that I can play in every game. Playing in the playoffs was a great experience and I’ll take a lot of that confidence with me into this season.\n\n\u003e In my mind, he has grown every year. There was a time really early, maybe three or four years ago, where I think he was very confident but maybe didn’t have all the tools yet to display that. Then, it’s hard to get it back sometimes. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e I think he’s gotten better every year, he’s shown that he’s very capable of playing in high pressure situations, in playoffs last year. Even leading up to that, yeah he wasn’t in the lineup for a couple of nights but there were other reasons for that. We think he can be a full-time player and be an effective full-time player. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/Day-6-Primer-+-The-Differences-Between-Playing-Center-and-Playing-Winger":{"title":"Day 6 Primer + The Differences Between Playing Center and Playing Winger","content":"\n# Day 6 Primer + The Differences Between Playing Center and Playing Winger\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-09-27 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [Day 6 Primer + The Differences Between Playing Center and Playing Winger](http://lakingsinsider.com/2022/09/27/day-6-primer-the-differences-between-playing-center-playing-winger/)\n2022-09-27 | [[LA Kings Insider]] |  [[Day 6 Primer + The Differences Between Playing Center and Playing Winger]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Jaret Anderson-Dolan]]\n- [[Lias Andersson]]\n- [[Rasmus Kupari]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Akil Thomas]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Following games on the road, on consecutive days, including travel back to Los Angeles last night after the win over Vegas, today’s skates are a bit delayed on start time. Group A is set to kick things off at 11:30 AM, rather than the usual 10:00 AM start time here in El Segundo.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e Definitely the defensive zone. Often times, you’re ending up low when you’re the center men, but with the way we play, if you’re the first guy back in the zone you end up being the low guy. It’s a little bit of both. I would say it’s just different thinking, a centerman is a little but more strategic, knowing where everyone is and as a winger, you’re kind of just marking your d-man and staying with him. It’s different but like I said, I’m feeling more and more comfortable with being on the wing, so I’m looking forward to seeing where I’ll be and definitely comfortable either way. -- [[Jaret Anderson-Dolan]]\n\n\u003e Wherever they want me. I played when I played center growing up, but these past two years with the Kings, I’ve been both, so I’m comfortable being a winger now. It’s actually a big difference, but I think it’s good to be able to play both positions. Center is more like stay down low, you win battles and winger is more like board work, blocking some shots from the point and it’s just details, but I think I got used to it pretty well, but you can always be better. -- [[Lias Andersson]]\n\n\u003e No \\[preference] really, I can play both. I’m probably normally a center, but it doesn’t really matter, I can play as a wing too. Last year, I played some good games on the wing and wherever the coaches put me, I’ll be ready. In our system, whoever winds up being the first forwards down low takes that center spot for a while anyways. Yeah, there’s a hug difference if you’re the low forward or the winger, you kind of have more resposibility when you’re down low. Doesn’t really matter to me though, whether I’m center or wing, I can play both. -- [[Rasmus Kupari]]\n\n\u003e The biggest differences are in the d-zone. I feel like it’s more stops and starts versus standing still and reading the play. As a winger, it’s making sure you’ve got your defenseman, so there are subtle differences, but in the o-zone, it doesn’t really matter. I’ve got to continue to work on \\[the defensive zone], you can always get better with your wall play and that’s important for me when playing as a winger, taking care of my own zone first. I feel like once I get in the o-zone I can create. -- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/Day-9-Primer-Todays-Groups-+-Arvidsson-and-Durzi-with-main-group-Wagner-clears-waivers":{"title":"Day 9 Primer – Today’s Groups + Arvidsson and Durzi with main group, Wagner clears waivers","content":"\n# Day 9 Primer – Today’s Groups + Arvidsson and Durzi with main group, Wagner clears waivers\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-09-30 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [Day 9 Primer – Today’s Groups + Arvidsson and Durzi with main group, Wagner clears waivers](http://lakingsinsider.com/2022/09/30/day-9-primer-todays-groups-arvidsson-durzi-with-main-group-wagner-assigned-to-ont/)\n2022-09-30 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[Day 9 Primer – Today’s Groups + Arvidsson and Durzi with main group, Wagner clears waivers]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n- [[Sean Durzi]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings are back on the ice this morning coming out of yesterday’s day off.

So, not only are we expecting that, that we know he can accomplish it, but the leadership part that comes with it. When you get into tight situations or you get into an overtime situation and you’re relying on a big player to step up, he’s now at that level for us. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e It’s different, certainly. A guy like that, you can obviously never replace. To be in this room for 18 straight years and 16 straight years that I was sitting next to him, it’s tough. But there are opportunities for the other guys to evolve, and those are big shoes to fill. But they do evolve and try to fill at least a little bit. -- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\n\u003e He’s been in the organization for a long time. We saw glimpses of that – at times there may have been 10 or 15 games stretches \\[he was good], and there would be some stretches where it wasn’t \\[as good]. The more complete player has come out of him throughout the years, and the fit within the lineup \\[is good] now, too. -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\u003e To me, where Adrian \\[was] the day I walked in the door and where Adrian is now, he’s gone from boy to man, in my opinion, and his responsibility for his own game has gone up immensely. And I see that in him. So, I have confidence that he can carry on. Is he a 35 goal scorer? I sure hope so. But I know he’s a 20 minute player for sure most nights, and that’s just as important as being a 35 goal scorer. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/Drew-Doughty":{"title":"Drew Doughty","content":"\n# Drew Doughty\n\nNHL.com / Ontario Reign | Twitter\n-|-\n[Drew Doughty](https://www.nhl.com/player/drew-doughty-8474563) | [@dewyy8](https://twitter.com/dewyy8)\n\nPlayer | \\# | Position | Shoots | Height | Weight | Born | Birthplace | Draft \n-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-\nDrew Doughty | 8 | RD | R | 6' 1\" | 210 | 1989-12-08 | London, ON, CAN | 2008 LAK, 1st rd, 2nd pk (2nd overall)\n\n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date       | Site                    | Title                                                                                                                                     |\n| ---------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-11-04 | [[Field Level Media]]   | [[Top line clicking as Panthers road trip stops in LA]]                                                                                   |\n| 2022-11-03 | [[The Forum Report]]    | [[No hands tipped on Clarkes status -

I thought we were pretty tight defensively, actually thought our team played a pretty good game overall. Just came up short in this one.\n\n\u003e Yeah, I think so. We’ve kind of started the year scoring quite a bit but also giving up a lot. I think our team is starting to turn around and play a little more defensive hockey, which I think most Kings fans are used to and Kings players are used to. I think that’s actually a good sign for us, when we’re in these 1-1 games versus 6-5 shootouts. I think it’s more our style and what our identity is and what we want to be.\n\n\u003e Yeah, for sure. As of late, my line specifically has been struggling on the defensive end of it. Our focus right now is just playing simple, smart hockey. When you can get pucks to go and it’s always nice.\n\n\u003e I think so, in bits and pieces. Obviously everyone wants to play a full 60 but it doesn’t always happen. I think going forward we need to take little bits from each game and try and put it together for a full 60.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e I would agree wholeheartedly. We talked about fixing some things after the Dallas game and we saw it today. They did a really good job of it, gave up very few out-numbered rushes. We were pretty solid defensively, good through the neutral zone, we did a lot of things well tonight. We didn’t get the win, sometimes bounces go against you and I think that’s what happened in overtime to Kevin in front of the net. At the other end, I didn’t think we had as much polish as we’ve shown offensively, some real good opportunities where we bobbled pucks with chances at breakaways, 2-on-1’s that missed the net or we didn’t make the right play. The one thing that’s been coming for us has been the offense and tonight it let us down a little bit.\n\n\u003e The NHL is all about winning games and they all balance out at the end but I thought tonight we may have deserved a better fate but we didn’t get it. The process part was one that, we’re not happy with, but we’re pleased to see process. Now we’re going to get home and get some rest and start to practice, we haven’t practiced forever.\n\n\u003e Well, that’s a that’s a tough question to answer because I think for two of the games it definitely did. Obviously the Dallas one, as I said in Dallas, you’ve got to give them credit, they really came out and played well. We did not respond and I thought as the night got tougher in Dallas, we got away from our structure more and more and that can’t happen. We got it back tonight, so it’s a good sign.\n\n\u003e I think it’s been a step forward every game, I don’t think \\[[[Kevin Fiala]]]’s stepping back at all. He’s a very dynamic player and good players make other players around them better and I see that too. In Kevin’s, situation he creates, Carl Grundstrom should have a goal tonight off a tremendous pass from Kevin. He makes other players better, he keeps a lot of plays alive, very creative. He’s starting to figure out our system and our structure a little bit more. He’s a hell of a player.\n\n\u003e Definitely. When they’re playing and they’re playing well, they’re very trusting line and they can play against anybody, at any given time, in any zone. We haven’t seen enough of that from that group and tonight, they did a much better job.\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/FINAL-Kings-1-Kraken-4-Clarke-Danault-McLellan-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"FINAL - Kings 1, Kraken 4 - Clarke, Danault, McLellan - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# FINAL - Kings 1, Kraken 4 - Clarke, Danault, McLellan - LA Kings Insider\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-13 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [FINAL - Kings 1, Kraken 4 - Clarke, Danault, McLellan - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/13/final-kings-1-kraken-4-clarke-danault-mclellan/)\n2022-10-13 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[FINAL - Kings 1, Kraken 4 - Clarke, Danault, McLellan - LA Kings Insider]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n- [[Phillip Danault]]\n\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings were unable to even their record on a season-opening, two-game homestand, with a 4-1 defeat against the Seattle Kraken.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Phillip Danault]]\n\u003e We have some work to do. We’re not playing a full 60 minutes, we’re sloppy with passes and the details and we have to capitalize as well. It’s not that we’re not trying, we tried really hard today, but it’s not enough. We’ve got to start better.\n\n\u003e Obviously you want to get a win, get going and it’s not even just about winning, it’s about the team game. I don’t think we’re on point at all, we aren’t moving fast enough, or playing the way we should be.\n\n\u003e It’s all around, it’s not somebody in particular, everyone has to step up their game. We have to pack our bags, go on the road and go into the war zone. We’ve got to get a win going and get back on track.\n\n\u003e Yeah, definitely. I think this is going to be good for our team. We have a couple of new guys here, so this is going to be much needed.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e We played much better defensively than we did in game one. We kept a heavy, hard team to 16 shots on goal at even strength. Our penalty kill did a really good job in a lot of situations, I know we gave up a goal, but the 5-on-3 was real positive. You know, there are some things that we have to take from that game and look at it positively. The negative side, we’re a minute and a half in and we have a too many men on the ice penalty. Game management. Three o-zone penalties tonight, game management. It’s something we’ve been harping and harping on and those are essentially impossible situations to practice, so they’ve got to take care of it.\n\n\u003e Little bit of both. They’re a scrappy team, they get in the way a lot, heavy, hard sticks, a lot of battles, a lot of crap coming out of the out of the bottles. There’s rarely anything clean when you play against them and when you do have the opportunity, I think we created more in the game, believe it or not, than what showed up on the scoreboard. The simple fact is, we didn’t want to shoot the puck, we wanted to be over-creative. I think of 2-on-1’s, I think of 3-on-1’s, I think we had almost a 4-on-1 and we didn’t get any shots off. It’s just too cute. When we’re playing well, I think you could kind of feel it in the third, we started to put some pressure on, we shot the puck, we got it back and got them out of position but a little too cute right now. We’re still trying to figure out who we are.\n\n\u003e I think the answer to both of those is yes. Reflective of the score and not liking what we’re seeing there, combinations of players were a little bit flat, there wasn’t a lot going on. We haven’t shuffled the deck a lot, potentially could wake the group up a little bit by shuffling it and trying to find maybe a combination that that gave us more life.\n\n\u003e You know, we dressed six defenseman tonight, I know he wasn’t six, pretty sure he wasn’t five and I don’t believe he was four either. So, that’s what I thought of him, I thought he had a real good night. He didn’t hurt us at all defensively, creative offensively. I’d like to see him shoot the puck a little bit because I think he’s got a great shot and he loves to pass but he had some real good looks at the net where he could have shot the puck.\n\n\u003e Well, it’s a losing streak to start the season already, because we’re at two and we haven’t put one on the board yet, but it is early. As I said, we’re trying to figure out who we are, how do we want to play the game? For the media that was there this morning or yesterday, it doesn’t happen automatically, you get to recreate yourself every year. The reference point that we had after game one was last year, now we have six periods in the bag and much better defensively today. Gave up far fewer opportunities than we did against Vegas, but still many things to work on. We didn’t put the points in the bank, but as I mentioned earlier, there were positive things to build on.\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/FINAL-Kings-1-Penguins-6-Kopitar-McLellan-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"FINAL - Kings 1, Penguins 6 - Kopitar, McLellan - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# FINAL - Kings 1, Penguins 6 - Kopitar, McLellan - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                   |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 2022-10-20 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [FINAL - Kings 1, Penguins 6 - Kopitar, McLellan - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/20/final-kings-1-penguins-6-kopitar-mclellan/) |\n| 2022-10-20 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[FINAL - Kings 1, Penguins 6 - Kopitar, McLellan - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                 |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings were unable to extend their winning streak to four games with a 6-1 setback against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Carl Grundstrom scored the lone goal for the Kings, with forward Blake Lizotte and defenseman Brandt Clarke collecting the assists, the first point of Clarke’s NHL career.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n- [[Carl Grundstrom]]\n- [[Brendan Lemieux]]\n- [[Blake Lizotte]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e When I look at the start we had, I thought we played the way we wanted to play. We played fast, we were aggressive, we forced them into situations where they had to turn the puck over and things were going pretty well for us. Even after the first goal, I thought we responded well, but by the time it got to three, unfortunately, it wasn’t the same way anymore and obviously we’d like to have a couple of those back in the first period. Even if we’re coming out of it at one, I think we’re in a much better state mentally, but with that being said, that’s the defensive side of it. I thought offensively, we had some opportunities with pucks on our tape cross-ice one timers, plays in and around the net where we weren’t particularly sharp offensively as well. We took it at both ends.\n\n\u003e Obviously the group was disappointed. We can’t go down three, it’s simple as that. We came in between periods talking about some of the things that we haven’t seen almost all year from our group and we’re down by three. So, we’re still figuring a lot of things out.\n\n\u003e I guess with [[Cal Petersen|Cal]], there’s no secret, we’ve got to get him going. He’s got to play like he can play. He’s an NHL goaltender, he’s an outstanding young man who has played extremely well at this level. We’re trying, just like we would with forwards and defenseman, to get him to where he can be, and he has to be better. I can’t stand here and BS you guys, it is what it is. There are others that have to be better as well in certain situations, but we had the momentum and we couldn’t close it.\n\n\u003e I thought that, now that [[Carl Grundstrom|Grunny]]’s back in the lineup, he’s been effective on all the lines. I thought [[Brendan Lemieux]] has really skated well over the last three or four games and [[Blake Lizotte|Lizzo]]’s intensity is showing up. They had a real good night. Not a lot of complaints about those three and if they can keep that going on, we’ve got one thing that we don’t have to worry about.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/FINAL-Kings-2-Stars-5-Kopitar-Danault-McLellan-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"FINAL - Kings 2, Stars 5 - Kopitar, Danault, McLellan - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# FINAL - Kings 2, Stars 5 - Kopitar, Danault, McLellan - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-11-01 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [FINAL - Kings 2, Stars 5 - Kopitar, Danault, McLellan - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/11/01/final-kings-2-stars-5-kopitar-danault-mclellan/) |\n| 2022-11-01 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[FINAL - Kings 2, Stars 5 - Kopitar, Danault, McLellan - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                      |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings were unable to make it two-for-two to begin a three-game road trip, as they fell by a 5-2 final in Dallas on Tuesday evening.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n- [[Phillip Danault]]\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Arthur Kaliyev]]\n- [[Carl Grundstrom]]\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Phillip Danault]]\n\u003e It definitely got us in trouble right away. We can’t do that because we knew they were fresh, they had two days off and we definitely have to be better and more careful with that. Yeah, they definitely cost us the game.\n\n\u003e Execution. They were playing better and faster than us and also the penalties got us, lots of penalties. We couldn’t find a way to get it done and the whole game was like that.\n\n\u003e Yeah, especially because we know how good we can play and how good we can be as a team. We want to improve every game and on a back to back, it’s always a great opportunity to steal some points. Obviously a disappointing ending tonight.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e Put it this way, the start wasn’t what we wanted and if you don’t have any legs, you better have your brains and we didn’t have either. That makes it real tough night, so that’s going to lead to penalties and the penalty kill did not get it done. We had it our tape numerous times to clear and it didn’t come out. With that type of firepower and that type of power play, it’s going to end up in your net, so that’s obviously a concern in tonight’s game. More concerning for me is the back to back and not being able to manage it real well with the mental part of the game. Anticipating where pucks are going to go, covering in the right situations. We didn’t do a good job of managing that.\n\n\u003e You know, you have to give Dallas credit they knew that we were playing back to back. I’m sure they weren’t happy with their last performance but they really skated well. They were much quicker, much cleaner than we were and they forced us to play long. We wasted a lot of energy chasing them all over the place. What energy we had and what hockey sense we were willing to use was wasted quite early by chasing them all over the place.\n\n\u003e Well, we got a chance our goaltender played well in the first period. We talked about it, we’re down one but we’re still in the game so we’ve got to be thankful for that. I thought when we came out in the second, we got back to probably what we were supposed to be, created a few opportunities, scored on the powerplay but the three goals bang, bang, bang really put a dagger in us. Those are preventable but not tonight.\n\n\u003e Well, we decided to go 11 and 7, we wanted to play that. We wanted to get Clarkie into a game and we thought it would be good idea.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/FINAL-Kings-3-Capitals-4-Arvidsson-McLellan-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"FINAL - Kings 3, Capitals 4 - Arvidsson, McLellan - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# FINAL - Kings 3, Capitals 4 - Arvidsson, McLellan - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                       |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-22 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [FINAL - Kings 3, Capitals 4 - Arvidsson, McLellan - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/22/final-kings-3-capitals-4-arvidsson-mclellan/) |\n| 2022-10-22 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[FINAL - Kings 3, Capitals 4 - Arvidsson, McLellan - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                   |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings were unable to cap off their first road trip of the season with a win, as they fell to the Washington Capitals by a 4-3 final at Capital One Arena.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n- [[Trevor Moore]]\n- [[Sean Durzi]]\n- [[Phillip Danault]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n\u003e I thought we didn’t take care of the puck enough in the third. They’re a good team and you’ve got to be aware in all situations. Not good enough.\n\n\u003e Yeah, I thought we were good in front of our net, in the first two periods we really limited their chances and had good sticks. Then, they hurt us in the third.\n\n\u003eYeah, I think I’ve been playing better and better every game. I thought in the Nashville game I felt good and that carried over. I think I’ve been playing pretty well on this trip, better and better, and I got rewarded for it tonight. I’m more comfortable with the puck, making plays and we’re starting to get our groove back, me, Phil and Mooresy. We’re starting to feel better.\n\n\u003e Yeah, I think so. I thought we were good offensively in the Pittsburgh game, but a little bit weak defensively, the game got away from us. Yeah, I think it was a good game \\[for our line] and we got rewarded.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e Well, I’m not sure that we were that good in the first 40 either. There were some chances, but there were fewer. It was a dead game and what I mean by that is not a lot going on either way. We got fortunate we scored a couple goals, got the lead. In the third, they got rolling, obviously got some momentum. I thought when we when we eventually scored to tie the game again, you could kind of feel it going our way a bit, but it didn’t work, so that’s kind of a summary of the third.\n\n\u003e They’re all different game situations. You take the last one, it’s off Clarkey’s foot and goes in, the third one I think we were unfortunate, we caught a bad break because Lizzo loses his helmet and that’s exactly where the pass went. Good teams make you pay for those, not sure if I call them mistakes, but lucky bounces. That was the case tonight.\n\n\u003e I thought that line was very good for us tonight. They did a lot of things well defensively that led to offensive chances, so it’s a good sign that Arvy is getting a little more polish in his game. It’s been a long time since he played in intense games like this. They were fine, I think Phil Danault is really starting to come around, Moorsy looks good, so we’ve got that line going.\n\n\u003e Potentially, but they’ve played some games too, they’ve been traveling around. We took a different approach yesterday to have that gas in the tank. It’s taxing at the beginning of the year, you’re not used to the games coming quickly and spending eight or nine days on the road but certainly not excuse for giving up what we’ve given up, 23, on the road. If we left LA last Friday and somebody would have told me we would score 20 goals on this road trip I’d be pretty darn excited about winning a lot of games.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/FINAL-Kings-3-Golden-Knights-4-Vilardi-Kopitar-McLellan-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"FINAL - Kings 3, Golden Knights 4 - Vilardi, Kopitar, McLellan - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# FINAL - Kings 3, Golden Knights 4 - Vilardi, Kopitar, McLellan - LA Kings Insider\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-11 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [FINAL - Kings 3, Golden Knights 4 - Vilardi, Kopitar, McLellan - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/11/final-kings-3-golden-knights-4-vilardi-kopitar-mclellan/)\n2022-10-11 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[FINAL - Kings 3, Golden Knights 4 - Vilardi, Kopitar, McLellan - LA Kings Insider]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n- [[Arthur Kaliyev]]\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings started off the regular season with a a difficult defeat, by a 4-3 final against the Vegas Golden Knights.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n- Kings Goal Scorers\n\t- [[Gabe Vilardi]] \n\t- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n\t- [[Arthur Kaliyev]]\n\n### [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\u003e It’s certainly a loss that’s tough to swallow right now, because there were a couple of goals that were clearly off of our mistakes. Positives were that we scored a power-play goal, we battled back a couple of times, especially in the third. I’m sure we’re going to look at some stuff to improve on and keep building on it.\n\n\u003e Yeah, I think so. For the most part, the d-pairings, the lines were intact throughout the preseason, not swapping around too much. There’s certainly some chemistry, but like I said, there’s always room for improvement and that’s what we’re going to do.\n\n\u003e Yeah, we’ll correct that for sure. You can chalk it up to a first game and all of that, but the bottom line is that we just can’t afford to lose a game like that, especially with the amount of mistakes that we made.\n\n\u003e A ton. He’s proven it for 15 years, so it’s certainly something that we’ve talked about before and I’m sure we’re going to talk about again moving forward.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e Well, the end result \\[was the most disappointing thing], because we were still in it at the end of the night, so losing a game that we got an outstanding effort by our goaltender and we still had a chance to win, still had a chance on point, really. Obviously the focus is going to be on the play at the end, which makes no sense, it’s hard to defend it, but our team gave up 51 shots on goal tonight. When you look at the night, the first goal against was just terrible game management, coming out of the penalty box and not being aware. The second one is at the back end of a power play, you have to rewind the video a little bit, we were on the power play and we negated it with the offensive zone penalty, so terrible game management there. Third one, an actual power-play goal and the fourth one was just stupidity. A lot of it is self-inflicted but you also have to give them credit. They put a lot of pressure on us and they created a lot of turnovers and a lot of pressure on our net, so we’ve got work to do.\n\n\u003e We’ve preached and preached about it, but sometimes you’ve got to get hit pretty hard with a 2×4 and maybe this was it. If you look at some of the penalties we’ve taken throughout exhibition season, I think I mentioned it a few times, we were penalized more away from our net than we were near our net and what I mean by that is neutral zone and offensive zone. Maybe it’s not important yet, I don’t know, but it’ll cost us eventually and it did tonight. Then, it’s simple game management things. Knowing where the puck is coming out of the penalty box on a line change you’ve got to be aware of that. Missing the net on that play. The end, a set breakout that we work on all the time, you’ve got numerous options. That is all game management, that’s getting engaged and ready to go. Their team did a better job of it than we did tonight.\n\n\u003e The camp was pretty open. We had an idea of what the roster was going to look like and then there was going to be a competition for some remaining spots, as well as spots in the lineup and on the powerplay. What he’s done is he’s come in and won ice time and he’s earned the opportunity to be in key situations and he continued to play. I thought he was one of our better players again tonight. Self satisfaction and individual growth is great and we need that from Gabe and we’re proud of him, I think he’s going to continue to do those things. As we drive home tonight, we’re not going to be too concerned about number 13.\n\n\u003e We can tell them that you just don’t turn the light switch on when the season starts but sometimes you have to live it a little bit and we mentioned it virtually every game in the preseason. Starting in San Jose, we were shorthand five times in the first period. We brought it up and we brought it up and when you’re in one-goal games, those moments cost you both offensively and defensively and it did tonight.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/FINAL-Kings-4-Jets-6-Kopitar-McLellan-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"FINAL - Kings 4, Jets 6 - Kopitar, McLellan - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# FINAL - Kings 4, Jets 6 - Kopitar, McLellan - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                           |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-27 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [FINAL - Kings 4, Jets 6 - Kopitar, McLellan - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/27/final-kings-4-jets-6-kopitar-mclellan/) |\n| 2022-10-27 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[FINAL - Kings 4, Jets 6 - Kopitar, McLellan - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                             |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings dropped a disappointing, 6-4 loss against the Winnipeg Jets on Thursday evening at Crypto.com Arena.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\u003e We can’t expect to win many games with giving up six goals. Whether we can blame it on the PK, not scoring on the power play, bad changes, turnovers, whatever, the bottom line is we can’t give up six and think we have a chance to win.\n\n\u003e The first one, stuff like that happens and we were still going, we scored three goals and then we proceeded to give up a shorthanded goal. That should not happen.\n\n\u003e You’re still up one, but you certainly don’t want to give one up there. In that moment, we should have been extending our lead instead of giving up shorties.\n\n\u003e It’s just playing more responsible.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e It’s 29, 30 of us because I’m including us as coaches and we’ve got to decide again and I’ve been saying this for 10 games. 12% of our schedule is gone and we still don’t know how we want to play. I would think the experiment of run and gun that we’re trying to play, like how much more evidence do we need that it doesn’t work. There are simple hockey principles, you don’t turn pucks over at the line, you get pucks in deep, you forecheck, short shifts. The penalties that we’re taking are unacceptable, so there’s a lot of game management situations that go into it and unless the group decides as a whole, we’ll experiment for another 10 games. Maybe we will become the run and gun team. I don’t like our chances, but if that’s how we want to play and that’s what we’re going to keep trying, we’re probably going to keep getting the same results.\n\n\u003e Power play. We’re on the power play and our only thought process on the power play is offense. There are times where there’s risk involved in it, but we don’t play risk at all, we just assume everything’s going work out fine and it comes back the other way, what, three times on two power plays. So, you’re in a situation where you have a really good period, you should be up and close to putting a team away early in the game and they’re right back in it, but you want to run and gun, you don’t understand risk, you don’t play risk and you’re not responsible for risk. That’s what happens.\n\n\u003e \\[[[Gabe Vilardi]]] has been probably our best offensive player. There are some things going on with Kopi’s line that I’m not happy with and I thought that that Gabe needed an opportunity there. \\[Would it be considered in future games?] Maybe. What we have right now isn’t working so we’ll have to address it tomorrow.\n\n\u003e We could use a better coaching staff, we could use some forwards that committed, we needed D that move the puck and we needed goaltending. There isn’t one area. I told the guys between the second and third, we all own a piece of this. So, dig yourselves out and we didn’t do it.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/FINAL-Kings-4-Lightning-2-Danault-Vilardi-Clarke-McLellan-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"FINAL - Kings 4, Lightning 2 - Danault, Vilardi, Clarke, McLellan - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# FINAL - Kings 4, Lightning 2 - Danault, Vilardi, Clarke, McLellan - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-25 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [FINAL - Kings 4, Lightning 2 - Danault, Vilardi, Clarke, McLellan - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/25/final-kings-4-lightning-2-danault-vilardi-clarke-mclellan/) |\n| 2022-10-25 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[FINAL - Kings 4, Lightning 2 - Danault, Vilardi, Clarke, McLellan - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                                 |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings evened their record on the season at 4-4-0 with a 4-2 victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning on Tuesday evening at Crypto.com Arena.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n- [[Phillip Danault]]\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n\u003e I’m just playing hard, that’s it. I’m just trying to keep it simple and play hard every game. Arvy goes out, that’s a tough loss for the team. When I slid in, I got to play with Mooresy and Phil, who I played with a little bit in the preseason, and that was a big win for our team today.\n\n\u003e I think our neutral zone tonight, they didn’t create much coming through there and I think we held them up really well. Our breakouts were cleaner as the game went on and that was huge for us in transitioning from defense to offense.\n\n### [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\u003e It was kind of late in the shift, so I’m happy that \\[[[Blake Lizotte]]] finished it off so the guy wasn’t going the other way.

I’m doing video with the coaches, I’m still a part of the team, so I’m just going day by day and enjoying my experience right now. I’ve been welcomed into the NHL and I’m just happy with how everything is. I’m happy to be on this team and just going to keep going for here.\n\n\u003e I think it’s huge. Coming off the tail end of that road trip, we didn’t finish how we wanted to, especially in that third period against Washington. I think it was a big step for us. It’s a talented team and going in with a two-goal lead again into the third period, we didn’t want to blow the lead last time but I think we used it as a good learning lesson. We kept the pedal to the medal for all 60 minutes this time.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e I thought our penalty kill was very good, against an outstanding \\[power play]. There were a whole bunch of good things tonight, but I thought our penalty kill gave us a strong belief. 5-on-3, a few other situations, we drew a penalty on our penalty kill, great goaltending. That was a real important thing and then fewer homerun chances for the opposition. We’re not perfect, but there were fewer and I thought we committed more to checking than we have in the past.\n\n\u003e Last season is last season, I think I’ve said this 100 times, this is a brand new slate for us. Yeah, there are some tendencies that showed up, which is a good sign, but I’d like to think we’re moving in the right direction, even the game in Washington, other than the comeback. We’re starting to do some things characteristic of last year, but this is this year’s group. We’ll still find our way and evolve as we go.\n\n\u003e We aggressively checked, and sometimes when you ask your team to check, they back off and they’re just standing and taking it, but we aggressively checked. When we had to go up ice, we went up ice. When we had to do what we needed to do in the neutral zone, we did it. We were all playing the same system for the most part, versus off on our own.\n\n\u003e I can’t say enough about the young man, \\[[[Gabe Vilardi]]]’s been outstanding since training camp. The fact that [[Viktor Arvidsson|Arvy]] wasn’t able to go after warmup, it was a bit of a surprise to us, but things got shuffled quickly and he has the toolkit to be playing up there. He’s got a lot of confidence on the power play right now, he’s checking well, using his body, his size. I think, as he leaves the rink every day, he’s really enjoying the game and he’s earned it.\n\n\u003e I think the fact that we keep using \\[[[Brandt Clarke]]], and putting him out in all situations. Special teams, 4-on-4, down by a goal, up by a goal, he seems to find his way out on the ice, so obviously we believe in him or we wouldn’t be doing that. The organization has to sit down and make decisions on what’s right for him, for us, for the future, for now. All Brandt has to do is worry about practice tomorrow and he’s done a really good job of that and he’s gotten great guidance from the older players in the locker room. That’s all he has to worry about, and he keeps worrying about only the next day, pretty soon it’s going to be June of next year and he’ll be flying home. If he gets too far ahead of himself, it gets tough.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/FINAL-Kings-4-Maple-Leafs-2-Fiala-Kempe-Petersen-McLellan-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"FINAL - Kings 4, Maple Leafs 2 - Fiala, Kempe, Petersen, McLellan - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# FINAL - Kings 4, Maple Leafs 2 - Fiala, Kempe, Petersen, McLellan - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-29 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [FINAL - Kings 4, Maple Leafs 2 - Fiala, Kempe, Petersen, McLellan - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/29/final-kings-4-maple-leafs-2-fiala-kempe-petersen-mclellan/) |\n| 2022-10-29 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[FINAL - Kings 4, Maple Leafs 2 - Fiala, Kempe, Petersen, McLellan - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                                 |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings finished a three-game homestand with a record of 2-1-0 following a 4-2 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs on Saturday evening at Crypto.com Arena.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n- [[Cal Petersen]]\n- [[Sean Walker]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Adrian Kempe]]\n\u003e Yeah, for sure. I think we played a good team game again, a good 60 minutes. The d-zone was a lot better than the last game, so we’re happy with that, and we keep scoring goals which is a plus for the team for sure.\n\n\u003eKeep shooting, I think being more of a threat, both with Dewy at the top and from the flanks a little bit more. We were trying to think a little bit too much before that and we didn’t want to shoot the puck. I mean, just going back to being simple I think is the key right now and obviously getting a couple goals gives you some confidence too.\n\n\u003eYeah, for sure and especially against these types of teams, you know, they play with a little bit more risk, I’m not gonna say than we have, but than we want to. Today, I think we did take care of our end a lot more and we got our chances at the other end too, which is a good thing. If we keep playing like that against those types of teams, I think we have a good chance.\n\n### [[Cal Petersen]]\n\u003e Yeah, one-hundred percent. Those are the kinds of games that we want to win and those are the games that got us far last year. I think that was a good step to getting our really our full team effort to where we want it to be.\n\n\u003e Just simple things. I knew my game was right there and it’s just doing the right things to get your confidence to where it needs to be. I wanted to make sure I put in the work to be prepared whenever my next opportunity was.\n\n\u003e Yeah, it’s obviously nice, it beats giving it up, but I mean I’ve played in a lot of games where I give up the first shot and a lot of games I’ve made the first save and the outcomes have all been different either way, good games and bad games. It obviously helps the confidence to get it back in, but you just take it one shot at a time whether it’s the first shot of the game or the last shot.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e Yeah, we’ve done this a couple times this season where we get back to what we need to do. That’s a pretty dynamic, offensive team that we played against tonight. Last year, we went into their building, checked pretty well and came up with a win and we tried to run and gun with them here and came up with a big loss. We tried to use some of last year’s approach for the game. We targeted three areas that we thought we needed to take care, that was it, and for the most part the guys got it done. That’s a real good sign and now the consistency is something that we need to grow.\n\n\u003e Yes, we did. Not pretty, but they went in and the goals were important. Again, that power play is dangerous, the quality of player they can put on the ice and the way they move the puck around, so the penalty killers did a real good job. You throw in the pulled goalie situation for the last two minutes, there was enough kill for a full night. Everyone to a man, D, forwards and especially Cal I’m really happy for him, they all did a real good job on the penalty kill.\n\n\u003e I thought we had a good response. It was near the intermission, which helped us, we talked about it and we liked a lot of things in our game. We didn’t like how that that goal happened, a turnover and then we kind of went to sleep for a second, but if we think we’re going to be perfect, which we’re all striving to be, we’re going to go insane, it doesn’t exist. We want to push for perfection and I think we realized we made a mistake, it ended up in our net, let’s go again, let’s not let it affect us.\n\n\u003e Kevin coming in has added a dimension \\[offensively]. I thought him playing in the position he did tonight balanced things out a little bit more. He’s been able to create with workers and creative players in his career, so he did a real good job there.\n\n\u003e I thought with Kevin going with Ras and that line, there was little more balance and all the lines contributed. The powerplay did its thing. I’m sure everybody would have preferred to have four or five minutes of ice time, they always do, but it was distributed pretty well.\n\n\u003e \\[[[Sean Walker]]] has worked hard in practice and we’ve got to keep in mind his injury, nobody talks about that and what he went through. It’s tough to come back from that, there are still repercussions to that as far as fatigue goes and how you feel, so sometimes he’s going to need the odd day off. We’ve talked to Blakey a lot about that because he went through it and he talked about the first four or five months of the season, sometimes you’re really sore. It’s not the injury itself, but it’s everything else around the injury that that can be fatigued, but he worked hard in practice, he felt good and it was time to play him again.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/FINAL-Kings-4-Predators-3-SO-Roy-Petersen-McLellan-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"FINAL - Kings 4, Predators 3 (SO) - Roy, Petersen, McLellan - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# FINAL - Kings 4, Predators 3 (SO) - Roy, Petersen, McLellan - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-18 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [FINAL - Kings 4, Predators 3 (SO) - Roy, Petersen, McLellan - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/18/final-kings-4-predators-3-so-roy-petersen-mclellan/) |\n| 2022-10-18 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[FINAL - Kings 4, Predators 3 (SO) - Roy, Petersen, McLellan - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                          |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings used an impressive third-period comeback to claim their third consecutive victory, a 4-3 shootout win over the Nashville Predators.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Matt Roy]]\n- [[Cal Petersen]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Cal Petersen]]\n\u003e It’s huge. We’re going to inevitably have situations like this again throughout the season and we can reach back and know that we’ve done it before. It’s part of our identity now and it was part of it last year, so now we have the confidence that we’re never out of it and we can find ways to come back and get points, win games.\n\n\u003e Yeah, granted, we blocked a ton of shots, you know, Mikey had a game-saving block there, it would have been over in overtime but I mean, it was just trying to build through each of these games with confidence. I haven’t felt like I’ve been getting the results that I wanted in these games, so that’s been challenging. Right now, it’s just building with each game, so this is huge personally for my confidence, but, it just feels good to get rewarded with the win.\n\n\u003e Yeah, I went back and started to squirt my water bottle when he got it alone in the slot because I know he always scores those. It was awesome. Another guy that it’s awesome to see get rewarded offensively, because he does so many things well defensively.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e Very thrilled. Guys are excited and happy for each other, back-to-back early in the year, in this building, it doesn’t happen often but our guys had a good mindset going into third. I didn’t think we were bad throughout the night, a lot of momentum swings again because of penalties, both our team and their team, but I didn’t think being down two was a disaster. We did some good things, stuck with it and found a way to win a game.\n\n\u003e Certainly. It’s hard early in the year to play back-to-back. We’ve played five games already, we played every second night and if you think about exhibition season even, when we started to play all the veteran players, we played every second night for two and a half weeks. That’s taxing both mentally and physically. Character with the comeback.\n\n\u003e It’s not often that we’re talking about [[Matt Roy|Matt]] scoring two, to tie the game in the third period, but he has that ability. He’s got tremendous legs, he’s strong, he went to the net and he knows the score, he can gamble a little bit more and he did a real good job.Big night for him.\n\n\u003e At the end of the night, [[Cal Petersen|he]] had to make outstanding saves in overtime and he was excellent in the shootout and he’s won two games for us. So, for as much it’s been talked that he’s got to find his game, he’s won two twice and that’s a real good thing. I think he started to settle in. We talked about the disruption of his training camp and the fact that goalies take a little while to find their game, but all he’s done is won. He should be confident, he should feel good about himself and was a big part of the win.\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/FINAL-Kings-5-Blues-1-Grundstrom-McLellan-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"FINAL - Kings 5, Blues 1 - Grundstrom, McLellan - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# FINAL - Kings 5, Blues 1 - Grundstrom, McLellan - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                   |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 2022-10-31 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [FINAL - Kings 5, Blues 1 - Grundstrom, McLellan - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/31/final-kings-5-blues-1-grundstrom-mclellan/) |\n| 2022-10-31 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[FINAL - Kings 5, Blues 1 - Grundstrom, McLellan - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                 |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings skated to a 5-1 victory over the St. Louis Blues to begin a three-game road trip against Central Division opposition.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Carl Grundstrom]]\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Rasmus Kupari]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Carl Grundstrom]]\n\u003e I think we played pretty well against Toronto and we had a couple of chances, so tonight we just tried to build on that. It was nice to get two goals tonight.\n\n\u003e I think we all want to play fast, make plays and go to the net. I think it’s been a well-balanced line so far.\n\n\u003e Honestly \\[[[Kevin Fiala]]] just has a really high skill level, he has great hands and great vision. I just try to stay open when he has the puck.\n\n\u003e Yeah, absolutely. We’ve just got to play our game, play tighter defensively and that’s what’s happened over these last couple of games. If we can keep doing that, we will be fine.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e It has for a couple of nights now – We’ll get some rest and we’ll see what happens in Dallas, but for the moment, yes. I knew we were going to have our hands full, they were obviously not very happy with our game just as we weren’t a few games ago. I liked the way we started, I liked the way we stuck with things, I think we checked our way to some goals, which was really important. Down the stretch, the penalty kill came up big, I thought Quickie had a real good night. Overall, a pretty good team effort.\n\n\u003e It makes it a lot tougher for the other team to pick and choose who they’re going to focus on. \\[[[Kevin Fiala]]] seems to be able to at a high level regardless of where he is. It allows \\[[[Gabe Vilardi]]] to play with some first-line players for a little bit. It just feels better right now, it looks better, fewer chances against for the most part. Overall, all four lines contributed.\n\n\u003e You’ve got to take what you’re given. I think, early in the year, we were forcing some stuff and still getting rewarded. Tonight, we took what was there. Grunny didn’t have anything on his goal, he came down, fired it and it was in the net. Kup found something when he set up a goal off the backside and it’s in the net. You have to read quickly and take what’s there and our team did a better job of that tonight than we have been.\n\n\u003e Well, we don’t want to take anybody out of the lineup, if we could dress 23 at night or 30 a night we would, but it’s just the way it works early in the season. Some guys come out just so other guys can go in. As the year goes on, there are going to be injuries, there’s going to be some upward play by people, some others that maybe don’t play quite as well and those decisions have to be made. \\[[[Carl Grundstrom]]] has proven himself to be a pretty effective player, he’s done a tremendous job in adapting to penalty killing this year, something he’s added to his game. We’re fortunate to have him.\n\n\u003e Yeah, I wasn’t even aware of it. You know, the next 100 are going be a lot tougher than the first 100. I’m only worried about 101 which is tomorrow in Dallas and we’ll have our hands full there.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/FINAL-Kings-5-Panthers-4-Moore-Vilardi-McLellan-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"FINAL - Kings 5, Panthers 4 - Moore, Vilardi, McLellan - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# FINAL - Kings 5, Panthers 4 - Moore, Vilardi, McLellan - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site | External Link                                                                                                                                                         |\n| ---------- | ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-11-05 | [[LA Kings Insider]]     | [*FINAL - Kings 5, Panthers 4 - Moore, Vilardi, McLellan - LA Kings Insider*](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/11/05/final-kings-5-panthers-4-moore-vilardi-mclellan/) |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings began a four-game homestand with a victory by a 5-4 margin over the Florida Panthers on Saturday evening at Crypto.com Arena.\n\n| Date | Site | Title / Internal Link | \n| ---- | ---- | --------------------- |\n| 2022-11-05 | [[LA Kings Insider]]    | [[FINAL - Kings 5, Panthers 4 - Moore, Vilardi, McLellan - LA Kings Insider]]                                 |\n\n## Players\n- [[Trevor Moore]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n- [[Jonathan Quick]]\n- [[Blake Lizotte]]\n- [[Rasmus Kupari]]\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Trevor Moore]]\n\u003e I thought Kopi had changed honestly, so when Vik made that play on the wall, I just peeked over and saw he was on the ice still. It just kind of set up nicely and a good play by [[Jonathan Quick|Quickie]] too, obviously.\n\n\u003e I think picking up from other guys, I have tried to in the past. High-end guys like \\[Mitch] Marner, they try to look before they get the puck and get their head up right away. Obviously I’m not at that level but it helps to take a peek before you get the puck.\n\n\u003e Ups and downs in that game, it was good offensively and Quickie was great, but there’s some stuff to button up defensively and we know that. We’re working on it and we’re getting better.\n\n### [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n\u003e Yeah, it was a back-and-forth game. I don’t know how many times we had the lead, or they were up, but yeah, it was. It was a tightly contested game.\n\n\u003e It was a tied up draw, I tied up my guy and Kopi ended up winning it. [[Alex Edler|Eddy]] took a shot and it went wide and I kind of read that it was going wide. I got a lucky bounce, it came out just on the other side of the goal line. I knew that \\[Bobrovsky] was coming late to the post, so I just tried to beat him under the glove and it ended up going in.\n\n\u003e Yeah, for sure. Largely, two of those goals we were on the ice. The first one there, the [[Mikey Anderson]] own goal, that starts with me, I was the high guy and I didn’t do a good job, so that goal was largely on me. The other one, I felt like I dived in and Tkachuk made a nice play, but it is nice to help the team win offensively after that game.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e Yeah, I would. Lots of highs and lows throughout the night, changes of momentum, open and then tight checking it had a little bit of everything so, character, yeah.\n\n\u003e Well, that was the turning point in the game. We’re penalty killing, goaltender interference, takes them off a power play and puts us on a power play, only 25 seconds of it maybe and the power-play goal that we scored was on that play at the end of the period. Coming in, up by a goal, have a little momentum, I think that was a break that we’re obviously pleased with. The connection of [[Jonathan Quick|Quickie]] moving it up and I think he had a sense of where the period was and that the power play was going to be short lived. He’s got pretty good hockey sense in there and credit to him to get that.\n\n\u003e \\[[[[Gabe Vilardi]]]’s done a lot of good things for us, you know, he scored the winner tonight. You can’t play your best every night, it’s impossible. So what do you have in your “B” game and Gabe had a good enough “B” game to be effective tonight. He scored, we trusted him in the in the last few minutes of the game. He’s done a real good job this season.\n\n\u003e That’s what \\[Matthew Tkachuk] does. It makes him a good player, it makes him a villain. Do we like the poking in [[Jonathan Quick|Quickie]]’s facemask? Of course we don’t, but I don’t think it’s anything that we can deal with. Now other people have to look at it.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/FINAL-Kings-5-Red-Wings-4-OT-Danault-Moore-Walker-McLellan-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"FINAL - Kings 5, Red Wings 4 (OT) - Danault, Moore, Walker, McLellan - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# FINAL - Kings 5, Red Wings 4 (OT) - Danault, Moore, Walker, McLellan - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-17 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [FINAL - Kings 5, Red Wings 4 (OT) - Danault, Moore, Walker, McLellan - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/17/final-kings-5-red-wings-4-ot-danault-moore-walker-mclellan/) |\n| 2022-10-17 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[FINAL - Kings 5, Red Wings 4 (OT) - Danault, Moore, Walker, McLellan - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                                  |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings came out on top following a back-and-forth game in Detroit, earning their second victory of the season with a 5-4 overtime win over the Red Wings.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Phillip Danault]]\n- [[Trevor Moore]]\n- [[Sean Walker]]\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Trevor Moore]]\n\u003e Yeah, for sure. It’s huge to have Arvy back, he’s a huge piece to our line and he brings so much offense to it. I think that was good, but I think we have to keep building in a lot of areas, myself especially win more battles and come up with more pucks and sustain pressure in the o-zone.\n\n\u003e It was kind of a weird play, I was coming for a change to get the defenseman on because we were on the power play and then the power play was ending. Everyone started yelling that the puck was right there, so I just turned it up. I just saw Phil on the back side, it was kind of a weird play.\n\n\u003e Yeah, I think that we’re doing some good stuff defensively, just still too many penalties. Putting too much weight on our penalty kill and Quickie in those spots.\n\n### [[Sean Walker]]\n\u003e Yeah, it was five minutes into warmups, I was just hanging out in the back and I heard Eds took a puck somewhere and just to be ready. I kind of started my warmups there and just got ready and got out there. Not the usual routine and everything, but I think I handled it well.\n\n\u003e Mentally, I don’t think there was very much time, it was just go out there and let the body take over. Physically, I had about five minutes to roll out and stretch quick, then it was get ready. It was definitely weird, but I think I handled it well and I was happy with how the game turned out.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e Real good effort, we’re getting better, it’s starting to feel a little bit more like how he should play. There are still moments during the game, obviously the empty netter, where we’re not quite there yet, but for the most part I thought we started to look a lot more like we should. Quickie had a good game, circumstances were strange again tonight, with Edler going down in warmups, and Walker by far had his best game of the season so far, including preseason so that’s a good sign. Good effort by everybody.\n\n\u003e Well, the players themselves, we had a lot of experience, four or five guys they settled down, everybody wanted to win it for Arvy, you saw a lot of guys going over and tapping him, saying no problem we got this. That’s how it ended, but we sure don’t want to be doing that too often, putting ourselves in that situation.\n\n\u003e The ability that upper-end players, just to make very small plays to keep a play alive or to create a chance….it was just a little touch through the neutral zone. Sometimes, our not-so-offensive players would quit on that, or they’d have already turned and they’d be backchecking, but the gifted ones are able to do that. Similar goal the other night in Minnesota with Kempe coming down and finding a hole off that wing with speed.\n\n\u003e We yelled at Sean Walker to get his equipment on, no warmup and he played, that’s all you can do. The game plan doesn’t change because one guy goes down, next man up and that’s how it happened. For me, I know Sean Walker would have to answer this question, but that may be the best way for him to go in and play. No thinking, just go play the game. His ability to come back from the injury after not having played for a long, long time, I thought tonight he did an admirable job under difficult circumstances.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/FINAL-Kings-7-Wild-6-Fiala-Kempe-McLellan-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"FINAL - Kings 7, Wild 6 - Fiala, Kempe, McLellan - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# FINAL - Kings 7, Wild 6 - Fiala, Kempe, McLellan - LA Kings Insider\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-15 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [FINAL - Kings 7, Wild 6 - Fiala, Kempe, McLellan - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/15/final-kings-7-wild-6-fiala-kempe-mclellan/)\n2022-10-15 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[FINAL - Kings 7, Wild 6 - Fiala, Kempe, McLellan - LA Kings Insider]]\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings moved into the win column on one of the strangest nights we’ve seen in awhile, a 7-6 win over Minnesota on Saturday evening.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Adrian Kempe]]\n\u003e Yeah, offensively it was a good game for us, especially after the first couple games when we didn’t really feel like we had enough offense going, so that was a step in the right direction. On the other side of the puck, I think we still have some things we’ve got to improve, but I think we deserved the win tonight. If it was 1-0 of 7-6, it doesn’t matter right now, this was a huge first win and we got better in all three zones. Good thing and a good win for the team.\n\n\u003e Yeah, for sure, and I think we showed a lot of that in preseason. In the first couple of games, I feel like you’re trying to get back into everything, you’re a little nervous when you get out there. It felt good out there tonight, I thought both units looked good. Somethings we can keep building on.\n\n\u003e Yeah, huge, I mean that’s momentum. The way you can get that back, it’s huge. I think we invited them, including myself, too many penalties tonight, so that’s something we’ve got to improve still. PK did a good job at the end, in the third, which is huge. We’re all excited about the game.\n\n\u003e Yeah, we had some more looks, we’ve played a couple of games together now, we’re trying to figure each other out through the first couple of games. When you start to figure it out, you know where each other is on the ice. We had some good chances so far in the first three games and we got a couple of good ones tonight.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e I think if you told us we were going to score seven goals, I’d have been jumping for joy. It’s the giving up six that isn’t the ideal recipe and that’s a really hard game to explain. I’m not sure that we’re going to give six goals up and win a game again this year, so that’s the negative side of it. The positive is we found ways to score seven. Strange night, maybe that’s what we needed to get a win and find a way. Rest and get ready for Detroit.\n\n\u003e Yeah, we were, but really, there wasn’t a lot of volume both ways. The shots weren’t 50 to 49 or anything like that, it just seemed to be going in the net, didn’t matter what happened. Whether it bounced or went straight in, it was an odd night for both teams in their zones. I thought both teams did a real good job of penalty killing, yet gave up power-play goals. For a lot of years in the league, this one’s tough to explain.\n\n\u003e We saw more from our power play tonight than we did in the first two games. We had a lot of changes, we’ve got new people in new places, we’ve got some new thoughts and ideas of how it wants to work. It’s going to be a work in progress, but you can see little snippets of things that are starting to happen and that’s a positive sign. Penalty kill, again, the best penalty killer we can have is not being in the box, I think we’re short six times from the beginning of the second period on. That’s a terrible recipe for success and we’ve got to find out a way to solve that and the penalty kill can do a better job.\n\n\u003e Important, very important, especially on the road. You can feel the momentum starting to go their way and to come back and have your key players execute and score in those situations is important. Just when the opposition is creeping back into the game and they get nailed with another one, that can do wonders for us. It buys us time to regroup and get our legs underneath us again.\n\n\u003e I would say that, I would say probably both teams were thinking the same thing. Get us the save and we’ll get you a goal. Obviously that was the way the night was going and we did give up six, I’m not sure that we can pin them all on Cal Petersen. So, what’s important for him is he got a win, he’s got some confidence as far as winning goes, and the team got that, but it’s pretty evident we have to clean some things up.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/Fial-ing-Right-At-Home-Film-Analysis-and-Quotes-from-a-successful-Minnesota-return-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"Fial-ing Right At Home - Film, Analysis and Quotes from a successful Minnesota return - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# Fial-ing Right At Home - Film, Analysis and Quotes from a successful Minnesota return - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [Fial-ing Right At Home - Film, Analysis and Quotes from a successful Minnesota return - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/16/fial-ing-right-at-home-film-analysis-quotes-from-a-successful-minnesota-return/) |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[Fial-ing Right At Home - Film, Analysis and Quotes from a successful Minnesota return - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                                                      |\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Whether it was extra motivation, the circumstances of the evening, or perhaps just a good plan coming together as intended, Kevin Fiala made the most of his homecoming yesterday in Minnesota. With a goal and two assists in the 7-6 victory, Fiala contributed offensively, in an arena he knows all too well. Fiala had 43 points from 41 games played at Xcel Energy Center last season, with his team winning 31 of those 41 games.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\nAnalysis of key plays by [[Kevin Fiala]] in his first game back against Minnesota.\n\n\u003e We saw that for sure, the PP is supposed to score goals and obviously it doesn’t always work, but tonight we moved the puck quickly and everything was fast. We shot it, we retrieved it, we passed it, everything was quick and I think that’s why we were successful. -- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n\u003e On the ice, it always takes a little while for new players to adapt to a new system, new teammates, new language from the coaching staff, but you can that the talent is there. He’s got a real good skill level and I don’t think we’ve seen the best of Kevin yet and that will come out later on. We’re happy to have him, he’s a really good addition. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e Much better tonight. Sometimes, on the road, you don’t think about it, you just play the game. When you’re not at home, sometimes you’re more of the underdog and maybe that was what helped today was that we just played the game, we didn’t think it. A good step, but we have to keep going. -- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/Fiala-Talks-Return-Analytical-Winners-Kopitar-Passes-Taylor-and-other-LA-Kings-Bullets":{"title":"Fiala Talks Return, Analytical Winners, Kopitar Passes Taylor, and other LA Kings Bullets","content":"\n# Fiala Talks Return, Analytical Winners, Kopitar Passes Taylor, and other LA Kings Bullets\n\n| Date       | Site               | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[Hockey Royalty]] | [Fiala Talks Return, Analytical Winners, Kopitar Passes Taylor, and other LA Kings Bullets](https://hockeyroyalty.com/2022/10/16/fiala-talks-return-analytical-winners-kopitar-passes-taylor-and-other-la-kings-bullets/) |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[Hockey Royalty]] | [[Fiala Talks Return, Analytical Winners, Kopitar Passes Taylor, and other LA Kings Bullets]]                                                                                                                             |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Ryan Sikes]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Cal Petersen]]\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Saturday marked Kevin Fiala‘s first game at the Xcel Energy Center since he was traded from Minnesota to the LA Kings over the summer. He tallied three points (1G, 2A) in the game. He was also honored with a video tribute\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e It was really nice being here, and I appreciate all the support from the fans. It was a great moment for me, and I enjoyed it.\n\u003e \n\u003e I felt pretty good and obviously you know a little more motivated playing against my old team but it was good. It was a good first step in our direction and my myself as well and now we just have to build. -- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n\u003e Fuckin’ hope we never have to win like that again, but give the guys a lot of credit. They battled back every time \\[Minnesota] put us on our heels and it’s not very often the last couple years that we’ve been able to trade goals when we’ve needed them, and this was a night we needed to find some goals, and we found them. A lot of credit goes to the guys. That’s obviously not the way I think we want to be winning these games, but hey … sometimes throughout the season some games are going to call for that. -- [[Cal Petersen]]\n\n\u003e There wasn’t a lot of volume both ways.

We just thought our energy stores would be a lot better by doing what we did.\n\n\u003e \\[...] and discuss how I’m going to use those moments as teaching points for the group as a whole. … Not embarrassing players, but I don’t think they like surprises, especially if they’re showing up negatively in a clip.\n\n\u003e Understanding how you have to do it, where the puck goes. A good forecheck’s predictable. You can dictate where the team is going to make the play, and we weren’t doing that early in the year. We were doing it \\[Thursday] night. But there’s also the back end of the forecheck – what are you leaving, and if it doesn’t go your way, can you be in position to make sure you’re adequately taking care of the neutral zone in your own end? And we weren’t really good in that area.\n\n\u003e There’s no fear in [[Brandt Clarke|him]] – and I don’t mean about the physicality and going into the corners, it’s just the fear of mistakes during the game.\n\u003e He’s certainly earned the opportunity to keep playing, and he’ll continue to do that.\n\n### [[Drew Doughty]]\n\u003e I’m telling [[Brandt Clarke|him]] after shifts, ‘don’t get outside the dots here,’ ‘don’t do this,’ or ‘you did a great job doing this.’ I’m always talking to him and he’s always asking questions, too, which is nice to see. But I had a lot of help when I was a young guy, and I’m a veteran now and I’m helping the young guys as much as I can.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/Francesco-Pinelli":{"title":"Francesco Pinelli","content":"\n# Francesco Pinelli\n\nNHL.com / Ontario Reign | Twitter\n-|-\n[Francesco Pinelli](https://www.nhl.com/player/francesco-pinelli-8482748) | [@cepinelli71](https://twitter.com/cepinelli71)\n\nPlayer | \\# | Position | Shoots | Height | Weight | Born | Birthplace | Draft \n-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-\nFrancesco Pinelli | | C | L | 6' 1\" | 185 | 2003-04-11 | Stoney Creek, ONT, CAN | 2021 LAK, 2nd rd, 10th pk (42nd overall)\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n\n\n\n## Post-Draft Coverage\n| Date       | Site                 | Title                                                                                                                 |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-11-04 | [[Kings at NHL.com]] | [[LA Kings Prospect Report, 11-4]]                                                                                    |\n| 2022-10-26 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[10-26 Practice - Todays Alignment + First Line Makes Progress, The JADebut, Pinellis Hot Start - LA Kings Insider]] |\n| 2022-10-21 | [[Kings at NHL.com]] | [[LA Kings Prospect Report, 10-21]]                                                                                   |\n| 2022-09-28 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[9-28 Preview – Projected Lineup + Reign Returners, Defensive Camp Battle, Bjornfot Quotes]]                         |\n\n\n\n## Pre-Draft Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n\n\n## Unprocessed Coverage\n- \n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/Friends-sent-Clarke-gifs-after-move-on-Crosby-Lemieuxs-effective-simple-game-Quick-Kuemper-Edler-in":{"title":"Friends sent Clarke gifs after move on Crosby - Lemieuxs effective, simple game - Quick-Kuemper - Edler in","content":"\n# Friends sent Clarke gifs after move on Crosby - Lemieuxs effective, simple game - Quick-Kuemper - Edler in\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-22 | [[The Forum Report]] | [Friends sent Clarke gifs after move on Crosby - Lemieuxs effective, simple game - Quick-Kuemper - Edler in](https://theforumreport.com/friends-sent-clarke-gifs-after-move-on-crosby-lemieuxs-effective-simple-game-quick-kuemper-edler-in/) |\n| 2022-10-22 | [[The Forum Report]] | [[Friends sent Clarke gifs after move on Crosby - Lemieuxs effective, simple game - Quick-Kuemper - Edler in]]                                                                                                                                |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jon Rosen]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Game day in our nation’s capital, Forum Club. Prior to tonight’s road trip finale against the Washington Capitals (4:00 p.m. PT / Bally Sports West / ESPN+ / LA Kings Audio Network), the LA Kings took the Capital One Arena ice for an 11:00 a.m. morning skate.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Sean Walker]]\n- [[Alex Edler]]\n- [[Jonathan Quick]]\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n- [[Blake Lizotte]]\n- [[Brendan Lemieux]]\n- [[Drew Doughty]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\u003e In the back of my mind, I was like, ‘holy \\[schnykies], holy \\[schnykies], that worked!\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e I don’t think they come into a game and say, ‘you know what? We’re gonna play cute.’ The uglier it is, the better.\n\n\u003e Well, you use the word ‘preacher.’ When you go to church, the preacher’s important, but the people sitting in the pews are the ones that really make the church up, and you either believe it or you don’t. So, [[Drew Doughty|Drew]] can continue to do that, I can continue to do that, everybody else in there can have an opinion, but the churchgoers have to buy into it. \n\u003e \\[...] And I don’t think that’s gone away, but I think it has to show up a little bit more.\n\n\u003e \\[[[Gabe Vilardi]]] can play high in the D-zone. We’d obviously prefer our centers down low. It doesn’t always happen that way. But I think he’s got more in his tank when it’s time to go the other way or hold people off and protect pucks than he did when he had to play down low. When you’re in point coverage, the distance to the offensive zone is cut down by a lot of feet. He doesn’t have to skate as much.\n\n### [[Brendan Lemieux]]\n\u003e \\[...] it’s only a matter of time when you’re playing the way we’re playing.\n\n\u003e We know where each other go on the ice. We’re not looking to do anything cute, and we’re playing the game the way a fourth line is supposed to play it, which is simple and make it hard on the other team. Nobody likes to play against the other team when they’re spending the all night in their end. And a great way of spending a night in the other team’s end is just by putting it in there.\n\n\u003e When we have an off-night, I think it’s just a result of trying to put it in and not being able to.\n\n\u003e I mean, no. The game’s only getting more skilled.\n\u003e I play a very simple style of hockey, and I try to just be myself and not make things too cute or try to make to many pretty plays, and just really beat people with simplicity. So, when I get to play with guys like, let’s say Grunny, who can play a simple game but also have the offensive ability and the skill to make other plays, it works into my favor. I’ve always been able to score goals and make plays, but I try to do it off simple plays rather than shooting the puck from the outside or trying to go top-shelf when I can just throw it on net and create a rebound or offensive zone time. I think our line’s identity and how our coaching staff has wanted us to play is to play that same simple style of game over and over and over and repeat that process.\n\u003e But no, I’m a simple hockey player that tries to do that every night.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/GM-Rob-Blake-looking-to-see-Kings-reach-another-level":{"title":"GM Rob Blake looking to see Kings reach another level","content":"\n# GM Rob Blake looking to see Kings reach another level\n\n| Date       | Site              | Link                                                                                                                                                 |\n| ---------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-11 | [[LA Daily News]] | [GM Rob Blake looking to see Kings reach another level](https://www.dailynews.com/2022/10/11/gm-rob-blake-looking-to-see-kings-reach-another-level/) |\n| 2022-10-11 | [[LA Daily News]] | [[GM Rob Blake looking to see Kings reach another level]]                                                                                            |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Andrew Knoll]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e A day before the puck dropped on a new campaign Tuesday, Kings general manager Rob Blake offered some searing answers to the burning questions for his team.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n- [[Phillip Danault]]\n- [[Alex Turcotte]]\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n- Pushing onward\n  \u003e Progress, again, continued progress.

Blake speaks to the media before the 2022-23 Regular Season\n\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e Q: Brandt Clarke's on the roster, 19 \n\u003e years old, could you talk about the\n\u003e thought process as he starts the year \n\u003e with starting the year with a kid that\n\u003e young\n\u003e \n\u003e A: yeah I think we we have some experience\nin on our staff I think [[Trent Yawney]]'s\ndone a terrific job with some young D in\nthe different organizations he's been in\nso we've relied on his help on that uh\n[[Jim Hiller]] went through the situation\nwith a young guy and the Islanders a\ncouple years ago so basically comes down\nto making sure when he does get in the\nlineup he's going to get the right\namount of minutes to to keep developing\nI think his play through rookie camp and\ntraining camp uh put him to a level\nwhere where we want to see him in the\nNHL and and that kind of went into the\ndecision process and uh but but now the\nstep is to make sure that it keeps going\nthat way and we'll let that play out\nhere the the first little while and and\nprobably have to reevaluate again\n\n\u003e Q: Rob, following off of that what is it\n\u003e that you saw in his game and you broke it\n\u003e down where you felt comfortable\n\u003e have him start here \n\u003e \n\u003e A: I think he can\nplay in all situations use him a lot on\npenalty kill\num which which can give you an\nopportunity to get the minutes needed to\nkeep developing at the NHL level uh\nPower Play obviously you see that you\nsee the deception and and uh his hockey\nIQ and that but also defending you know\na good in his sense and his defending\nand that he's going to have to learn to\nprotect himself a little bit more guys\nare bigger and stronger at this level\nthan Junior but I think the all-around\ngame there's a lot of aspects that that\nwould allow a player when he does get in\nthe lineup in the regular season to\nmaintain those minutes that are going to\nhelp progress\n\n\u003e Q: Lot of depth on the right side in th\n\u003e lineup does that kind of allow you to ease\nhim in and you know is there a drive\nfrom that group you like seeing on the\nleft side yeah\n\u003e \n\u003e A: well we've tried quite a few over there\nyou know [[Sean Walker]]'s played there at\ntimes I think we got to get them\ncomfortable coming back from knee\nsurgery before we experiment again with\nthe left side uh [[Sean Durzi]] saw the last\ngame slide over there and and made that\ntransition really easy and we've used\nBrandt Clark a couple times over there so\nthe availability to open up that left\nside within our defense can can increase\nthe getting Brandt in the lineup getting\nthe minutes he needs\n\n\u003e Q: Rob, five and a half\nyears\nyeah can you confirm any speculation\nabout contract extension for yourself\n\u003e\n\u003e A: well it was done basically done last\nyear and during the summer there was\nnever really an official announcement\njust because we didn't feel we needed to\non that aspect\num but yeah that was that was taken\ncare of their uh probably\nI would say just immediately after the\nseason was over\n\n\u003e Q: And short of winning the Cup\n\u003e what does succeess mean to you \nat this time\n\u003e \n\u003e A: progress again continued progress I\nmean we made a big step getting back in\nthe playoffs now you've got to hold that\nlevel and keep getting into and but I\nthink the roster starts to take a little\nmore shape you know you had a few pieces\nto free agency you give the young guys a\ncouple more years to get up and running\nat the NHL level now you put the\nemphasis on them producing and helping\nus keep winning\n\n\u003e Q: Rob, it's hard and Todd said it right off the\nbat and it and I think some of the group\nhave talked about it you know the\nword expectations what's worried\nIs that something where you feel like now\nthe club is at that point to embrace the\nheightening expectations\n\u003e\n\u003e A: I I think so and with\nexpectations there comes a lot that goes\nwith it I think we really have to Define\nwithin our interior walls what what we\nexpect out of this group and and to that\nyou know just building and getting\nbetter every time we're on the ice we got to\nget better we got to get our special\nteams better we need a lot of areas of\nour game need to increase uh you know\nfrom a year ago to keep that level but\nbut those expectations and we've talked\nto the players and everything it's from\nwithin we we Define that on a personal\nlevel and as a team level and and their\nexpectations that we we we want these\nguys to meet\n\n\u003e Q: On special teams, [[Jim Hiller]] has joined\n\u003e the staff power plays look a little bit different\nso far what did you like about him when\nhe brought him in and what he's kind of\ndone with that so far.\n\u003e \n\u003e A: yeah that and Todd had a big say in that\nobviously uh he wanted experience in\nfilling that role when that when that\nrole became open he he definitely wanted\nexperience just because of the the\nAvenue that he felt our team was at and\nthat he wanted to put that right into it\num I think on the power play you know\nit's another year of of adding a couple\ndifferent younger players into that uh\nequation however we roll out you know\none or two units and then the addition\nof fiala gives you a different look on\nthat so you can see a little bit\ndifferent movement on our power play\nthan we've had in the past\n\n\u003e Q: How long did it take you to process the\n\u003e game 7 loss that was a tough situation to be\n\u003e so up and down. for you personally\n\u003e through the summer, how long did it take\n\u003e you to process it\n\u003e\n\u003e A: um I I think it was more of a building\nprocess of oh okay we not only got in\nthe playoffs but you pushed the team\npretty far and we had an opportunity at\nhome here to to get things that we\nunfortunately didn't take that next step\nbut I I do think it exposed a lot of our\nyounger players due to injury to to a\nreal heightened level of play and also\nin a market that you know was striving\nfor the playoffs there and and so\neverything around it you just take that\nand continue to build on it\n\n\u003e Q: Rob when you look at Fiala now that\n\u003e you get a chance to watch him day in\n\u003e and day out anything kind of catch you\n\u003e off guard and how do you assess how \n\u003e he's fit in\n\u003e  \n\u003e A: Puck protection probably number one\nright uh the the ability to protect in\ntight tight areas he's got real real\ngood hockey Vision there and an IQ and\nmaking plays in that but he battles to\nprotect pucks and he gives us an element\nthat I'm not sure we had a whole bunch\nin this organization he's he's a natural\nscorer a lot of high-end offense and and\nvery creative in in the types of plays\nhe wants to make uh you know probably\nfrom the red line in\n\n\n\u003e Q:  last season\nyou've got career highs from Kempe\nyou had Danault show a new dimension to\nhis game\nis there any sense in your Roundup was\nthat a fluke or is that the beginning of\nsomething new I mean how do you judge\nthat how do you look at that\n\u003e\n\u003e A: um well I I\nsee progress in those guys games I'll\nspeak I guess first on Kempe he's been\nin the organization for a long time we\nsaw glimpses of that you know at the\ntimes they they may have been 10 or 15\ngame stretches and there would be some\nstretches where it wasn't so you know\nthe more complete uh player I I think\nhas come out of him throughout the years\nand and and the fit within the lineup\nnow too\num you know with Phil I think our you\nknow when we acquired them it was you\nknow we knew we were getting a good\nplayer we weren't sure at that level of\noffense and and now\num he seems to find a real good\ncompliment with [[Trevor Moore]] and [[Viktor Arvidsson|Avridsson]]\nand in the way they play uh down low and\neverything but yeah we definitely have a\na you know an expectation of Phil that\nthat now increases offensively\num but I think a lot of it surrounds\naround his leadership I felt that he\nadded a big touch to that but but you\nknow that was created excitement that\nsome of those players bought in and now\nwe have to get that out of Kevin Fiala\nwe have to get it out of some of our\nyoung guys that are are going to take a\nlittle bit more prominent roles on the\nteam\n\n\u003e Q: Rob, on Fiala, we know that Minnesota\n\u003e had some cap difficulties obviously\nbut when did you first kind of Target\nhim kind of really had him in mind as as\na possibility \n\u003e\n\u003e A: yeah it's a little\ndifferent situation a lot of times you\nknow as you prepare for free agency\nyou're Gathering lists of of players\nthat you know are free agents and and\nyou know contract wise and understand\nthat first of all you had to I guess\nfind the uh the need for that type of\nplayer within our lineup and what it\nwould do but then there's also players\nthat names come about just because of\ncertain situations where their teams not\nnecessarily free agents and now now you\nhave to go and try to acquire it so\nthere was a process leading up to it\nthat that all teams do you speak to all\nteams and understand kind of players\navailable but it fit a specific need we\nwere looking for that we may have had to\naddress in free agency but were able to\ndo it beforehand just because of the\nsituation \n\n\u003e Q: how quickly does the deal come together\n\u003e \n\u003e A: uh it was probably a well it it's a\nlonger process in the car in the in the\num the talks and everything this one was\na little bit different in uh the\nopportunity to to have to you know get a\ncontract in place for the player and\nthat but as far as the real negotiations\nthere's a four or five day window where\nyou go back and forth um when you know\nboth teams are actually serious about\ntrying to get a deal done some sometimes\nthere's a lot of process beforehand that\ntakes place but when when you understand\nboth sides want to get the same thing\naccomplished then then you go to work\n\n\u003e Q: Rob, what do you do with all the right handed\n\u003e defensemen now. \n\u003e \n\u003e A: well yeah no it's uh it's a unique\nsituation I'm not sure we see it too\noften in the league you see a lot of\nlefties over righties like I said I\nthink Trent's been good at experimenting\nor or or trying like with with the\nDurzi and the Walker and Clarke and uh\nthese are good players that I don't I\ndon't feel\na necessary worried about having to put\na guy on the left side it's just the way\nour makeup is on our team\num you know with some of the injuries\nlast year to Walker to Doughty to Roy we\nhad to put some guys in the lineup early\nwith Durzi and and he took advantage of\nthat and Jordan Spence they just happen\nto be all be righties\n\n\u003e Q: Talking about Spence, is it tough to\n\u003e have the conversation with him? \n\u003e\n\u003e A:  yeah he's a very good player\nyep I had to have that with him with\n[[Rasmus Kupari]] with [[Jacob Moverare]] you know\na number of players there\num I still think those players can learn\nin the American League I I think a\nplayer eventually if he's good enough\nand he's an everyday NHL player there'll\ncome a point when he's not going to\nlearn a lot more in the American League\nI I still think we can get some uh\nthings accomplished out of these players\nand that was our message was you did a\nterrific job you've done everything\nwe've asked you to do so far we still\nthink you can get better and we're gonna\nwe're gonna need you down the stretch\n\n\u003e Q: how do you evaluate [[Quinton Byfield]]'s preseason\n\u003e what are you looking for we're getting the information\n\u003e that he's alright.\n\u003e\n\u003e A: well I I think he is I I you know\nunfortunately we had a little setback\nduring training camp here with with an\nillness there that kept him out a week\nand a half and probably took uh I think\nwe had scheduled maybe five preseason\ngames and he ended up not getting\ngetting that we would hope so uh I liked\nyou know both Todd and I talked about\nhis last preseason game the the fit with\nthat line just where he sits in the\nlineup is what we're excited about and\nallowing them to kind of become the\nplayer he's had he's had a tough injury\na year ago that set him back but both\ntimes he's come into Camp ready to go\nand and look to us like he could earn\nthat spot and uh he'll get his chance\nthere now\n\n\u003e Q: What about [[Cal Petersen]] and your\n\u003e concerns if any about him\n\u003e \n\u003e A: yeah no we you know I think he can be\nbetter than he was in preseason and he\nknows that he had a period where he had\nan injury there in Vegas and had to come\nout of the lineup for a little bit and\nthen get put back into a couple games\num you know in in those situations near\nthe end of Camp we're we're trying to\nget both goalies ready for camp and and\nwe know we had specific games in that I\nthink their situation both Jonathan\nQuick and Cal is the exact same as it\nwas last year they're going to battle\neach other for those starts but but in\nturn that's going to help our team\n\n\n\u003e Q: Rob, how do you forecast the Pacific\nthis year\nyou know lost to Edmonton wound up getting where\nthey were in transition\n\u003e\n\u003e A: they're they're good teams they're all\ngood teams and then I don't think you\nknow that\nthat part of the equation it works\nitself out and everything we understand\nwe're going to be in a battle to get in\njust like we were last year we want to\nbe a little more consistent\num you know as especially on the Special\nTeams both penalty kill and power play\nthroughout but just the dictate the\nstyle of play that we want early on in\nthe season too\n\n\u003e Q: Kempe's always seemed to have a great\n\u003e work ethic, constitution.\num has he's now become a veteran like how\nhow is his leadership vocal Drive how is\nthat playing out\n\u003e\n\u003e A: it takes more a prominent role I think\nwe saw that a little bit last year\ncoming out with them\num\nuh more so just in the everyday game or\nthe everyday approach like I said I\nthink his biggest accomplishment last\nyear was his consistency right from day\none and and obviously scored a A large\nnumber of goals but but that transfers\nover to okay we we need that again outta\nyou. so so not only are we expecting\nthat we know we can accomplish it but\nbut the leadership part that comes with\nit and when you get into tight\nsituations or you get into an overtime\nsituation and you're relying on a big\nplayer to step up he's now at that level\nfor us\n\n\u003e Q: What factors went into the decision\n\u003e to go with 7 D as opposed to 8 D\n\u003e \n\u003e A: oh\nwell Lots I I think the way you look at\nit if you're in our 12 or our starting six\nwhich we would project upstairs\nregardless of your situation in the CBA\nway realize you're we're making a spot\nright now you have the ability to carry\nuh three extra players whether it's two\nforwards or a d then we we have to look a\nlittle bit at the waivers and and\nunderstand that we want to protect some\nof the assets and the players and\nthere's a few players that didn't need\nwaivers to go down but we also felt that\nthey can still build their game down\nthere so um and we all know I mean knock\non wood today is as healthy as we've\nbeen in in a full year I think we got\nback to it on Sunday we saw every player\nback we know we're going to deal with\ninjuries and we're going to need some\nadded depth down there that can come in\nand play\n\n\u003e Q: What strides have you seen from \n\u003e Gabe Villardi in preseason after the time\n\u003e he had last year\n\u003e \n\u003e A: well I I think he had a real good\npreseason last year and uh he's playing\nalongside I think [[Lias Andersson|Lias]] and Quentin and\nboth those two ran into injuries and uh\nyou know his first four or five games\nprobably wasn't the start after coming\noff that camp he continued to build um\nyou saw him in a slightly different role\nthis year I think on the Special Teams a\nlittle net front which which kind of\nfits his characteristics he's got uh\nreal good size protects the puck well got\ngood vision and everything and in good\nhand-eye would move in plays so I think he\ncan compliment our special teams and he\nwas having some success in the uh\npreseason with that now we've got to\nbuild off that but uh but yeah I know he\ncame in and uh and he was one of the\nplayers that um you know when I said we\ngot 12 and you're looking for two or\nthree extras in there he was able to\nseparate himself from a group because of\nthe way he played\n\n\u003e Q: what's the status of [[Alex Turcotte]]\n\u003e \n\u003e A: uh turk he obviously dealing with a\nconcussion injury that uh that he\nsustained at the end of last year\num and was on track doing well in the\nsummer but then had a setback during the\nsummer in summer hockey so we're dealing\nwith that uh he's currently in uh in a\nstage of his rehab where he's skating on\nhis own\num you know progressing from that point\nuh we have some medical appointments\nnext week for him if everything goes as\nplanned and in the way it's corrected uh\nhe'll soon start working his way back\ninto a non-contact spot in practice and\nwe'll go from there but it uh it's it's\na difficult situation for him and and\nfor us but we we have to put the health\nof him first I know we want him to do\nall this and everything but he has to be\nhealthy with himself in in that\nsituation before he can get back into a\npractice\n\n\u003e Q: Rob is it more difficult to make the jump\n\u003e from non-contending team to playoff team than go from playoff team\nto like serious Stanley Cup Contender now\nbecause you're not going to sneak up on\nanybody \n\u003e \n\u003e A: yeah we're not sneaking up on it\num yeah I would I would say it's tougher\nonce you once you become a playoff team\nto be able to become a real Contender\nyeah because it's because now you're\ndealing with really really good teams\nyou know the ones that get in I I think\nlike I said we made a step last year but\nnow now we have to make sure we're we're\ntaking the ability to move past that and\nand keep that going so\num yeah I think Todd used the words not\nsneaking up on anybody no not anymore\nlike but but I I think our coaching\nstaff will have our players prepared for\nthat\n\n\u003e Q: heading into the season how\nclose is the club to what your ideal\nversion of the club would be \n\u003e \n\u003e A: it's\ngetting there it's getting there I think\nthere's less and less\nconcerns through a lineup I think there\nstill are at different times in that and\nthere will be as the season goes on but\nI I do think we have players that can\nfill some certain roles and we do have\nsome depth in the right positions if\nneeded you know that that was a major\nFactor last year that I'm not sure we\nhad\nset and understood well enough with\nmajor injuries that some of these guys\nwere able to step in and play those\nminutes and and now we I think we're in\nthat same situation now we know that \n\n\u003e Q: do you feel like you're situated today\ndo you feel like your strategy for\nrunning the club over the last few\nseasons has put you in a position of\nstrength that you are glad you did \nthat \n\u003e \n\u003e A: yeah I think we're in a spot where\nwe continue to build on it you know the\nroster is starting to take that shape\num you know the you know we've talked a\nlot about younger players the last few\nyears  but now they're getting\nthey're getting some of the games in\nthey're getting uh you know whether \nit's time in the American League or\nvaluable time in the playoffs to to\nbecome not only players in our lineup\nbut help us start winning\n\n\u003e Q: Rob bit of a big picture that we're seeing here but now\nyou're obviously more tighter against\nthe cap than whatsoever how do you just\nlook at in terms of managing the cap\nover the season and maintaining the kind\nof flexibility that you want to be able\nto have if and when in-season moves or...\n\u003e \n\u003e A: yeah\nyeah well it's a day-to-day basis\n[[Jake Goldberg]] runs a lot of that on our\nyou know or in the back room here and he\nprovides an update on every day and and\nand where we are at the cap the type of\nsavings depending on which players\num within your 23 or even if you're\ncarrying a little bit less to save here\nand there that all comes into Factor uh\nany deals you're looking at any\npotential deals and everything once\nyou're up against the cap or very close\nto it you have to take all that into\nconsideration \n\n\u003e Q: what was that the plan\nespecially after obviously adding Kevin\nsigning Adrian whatsoever but you knew going\ninto this year okay we're going to be at\nthis spot we're going to be tighter and\n\u003e \n\u003e A: yep no and it's it's constant planning\nnot not only for tomorrow or the next\nday or month but for a year past year\nyou know and then\num but but all teams are have those\nrestrictions and deal within that\n\n\u003e Q: Rob you mentioned about your contract with us\nwhat about Todd \n\u003e\n\u003e A: yep yes he's got a year\nleft yes\n\u003e\n\u003e Q: one year?\n\u003e  \n\u003e A: yep yep uh well this year and next year\nyes yes sorry\n\u003e\n\u003e Q: Any movement for any kind of extension\n\u003e that far?\n\u003e \n\u003e A: no I don't think we would get into that\nright now you know I'm sure that that\nconversation takes place at the end of\nnext year like once it went to Seasons\nbut\num you know most of our coaching staff\nall of our coaching staff is pretty much\nequal in that situation too so\n\n\u003e Q: In past seasons you had players claimed\n\u003e off waivers from the LA Kings. This season is\n\u003e  there any time or thought spent paying \nattention to other teams rosters \nwhen making your decision about when to expose \n\u003e \n\u003e A: um yeah you know we go over that\nconstantly if if we\nif we're in a healthy situation we have\nplayers that that may have to be exposed\nin waivers when do you when you put them\non and when don't you and I mean there's\ntwo  thoughts you put them on early but\nthen the team can claim them and look at\nthem you put them on later that still\nallows the team to have injuries most of\nour situations was we wanted to get\nthrough our camp make sure we're healthy\ncoming into Sunday uh yesterday sit down\ndiscuss the lineup players that were\nwaiver eligible and weren't and then go\nforward from there you know losing\nplayers on waivers is it's part of the\nprocess I think we have to understand\nthat and and when you start getting\nbetter and you have more quality players\nyou'll be in those situations\n\n\u003e all right everyone thanks\n\n## Editorial Comment\n- At 12:43, Blake is asked about the decision to go with 7 defnsemen instead of 8. In his reply, he states that if players are in the top 12 forwards or top 6 defensement, they'll make a spot regardless of CBA protection or waiver wire. \"We're making a spot.\" It's the 21st through 23rd palyers where waiver eligibility enters into the equation, to manage assets.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/Gabe-Vilardi":{"title":"Gabe Vilardi","content":"\n# Gabe Vilardi\n\nNHL.com | Twitter\n-|-\n[Gabe Vilardi](https://www.nhl.com/player/gabriel-vilardi-8480014) | [@Gabe_Vilardi13](https://twitter.com/Gabe_Vilardi13)\n\n| Player           | \\#  | Position | Shoots | Height | Weight | Born       | Birthplace        | Draft                                    |\n| ---------------- | --- | -------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ---------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |\n| Gabe Vilardi | 13  | C        | R      | 6' 3\"  | 215    | 1999-08-16 | Kingston, ON, CAN | 2017 LAK, 1st rd, 11th pk (11th overall) |\n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date       | Site                    | Title                                                                                                                                     |\n| ---------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-11-06 | [[Hockey Royalty]]      | [[Takeaways -

He has played, and earned top line minutes, on a stacked club that is getting ready to host the 2017 Memorial Cup. In February, Vilardi missed some time due to an appendectomy, and it was clear that the Spitfires were hampered by his absence. He has picked up where he left off, and put up good numbers down the stretch and early into the OHL Playoffs. Vilardi has scored 29 goals and 61 points in 49 OHL games this season. Vilardi was part of the OHL White team that won a gold medal at the 2016 World Under 17 Hockey Challenge, putting up four goals and seven points in six games.\n\n## Players\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n- Skating\n\t\u003e decent, but not great speed\n\t\u003e good balance and power in his stride\n\t\u003e protects the puck well down low\n- Offensive game\n\t\u003e very long reach and excellent puck handling ability\n\t\u003e very good wrist shot and an excellent release\n- Defensive game\n\t\u003e shows great effort on the backcheck\n\t\u003e has a lot of potential but will need to keep working on this aspect of his game\n- Projection and Comparison\n\t\u003e first line power forward\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/Gary-Roberts":{"title":"Gary Roberts","content":"\n# Gary Roberts\n\n| NHL.com | Twitter |\n| ------- | ------- |\n| [Gary Roberts]() | [@twitter_handle](https://twitter.com/)\n\n| Title | Organization |\n| ----- | ------------ |\n|       |              |\n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date | Title |\n| ---- | ----- |\n|      |       |\n\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\n| Date | Title |\n| ---- | ----- |\n|      |       |\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/Glen-Murray":{"title":"Glen Murray","content":"\n# Glen Murray\n\nNHL.com | Twitter\n-|-\n[Glen Murray]() | [@twitter_handle](https://twitter.com/)\n\nTitle | Organization \n--- | ---\nSenior Director of Player Personnel | LA Kings\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\nDate | Title\n---|---\n\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\nDate | Title\n---|---\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.730382086Z","tags":null},"/Going-in-the-right-direction-but-inconsistently-forwards-chemistry-identity-become-key-Quick-starts":{"title":"“Going in the right direction, but inconsistently,” forwards chemistry, identity become key - Quick starts","content":"\n# “Going in the right direction, but inconsistently,” forwards chemistry, identity become key - Quick starts\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-25 | [[The Forum Report]] | [“Going in the right direction, but inconsistently,” forwards chemistry, identity become key - Quick starts](https://theforumreport.com/going-in-the-right-direction-but-inconsistently-forwards-chemistry-identity-become-key-quick-starts/) |\n| 2022-10-25 | [[The Forum Report]] | [[“Going in the right direction, but inconsistently,” forwards chemistry, identity become key - Quick starts]]                                                                                                                                |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jon Rosen]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Back at’r, Forum Club. The lopsided Kings-Bolts series returns to Downtown Los Angeles where the hosts will look to snap a 10-game losing streak extending back to Brayden McNabb’s game-winner during the first half of the 2015-16 season. No lines were suggested at an optional morning skate, with Todd McLellan noting the team may have to make a decision on one player after warm-ups. Asked whether that might be a forward or defenseman, he replied, “Could be goalie. You didn’t ask. Gotta cover all three bases.”\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Jonathan Quick]]\n- [[Trevor Moore]]\n- [[Phillip Danault]]\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n- [[Alex Iafallo]]\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n- [[Arthur Kaliyev]]\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003eKopitar has always felt most comfortable with predictable, well-positioned wingers operating tightly within team structure, one reason why the freewheeling [[Ilya Kovalchuk]] was a poor fit – something Kopitar and the team acknowledged privately during the throes of the winger’s two-season L.A. tenure. \n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e going in the right direction, but inconsistently\n\n\u003e When you scramble it up completely and have three new guys on there, the whole communication thing has to start all over. But those three \\[[[Phillip Danault]]-[[Trevor Moore]]-[[Viktor Arvidsson]]] have that. They have a tenacity, and they’re unified.\n\n\u003e We spend a lot of time talking about release areas – ‘where do I need to be?’ ‘You’re trapped in the corner, where am I going?’ ‘Where do we lay the puck in?’ and to me, that’s how a line develops an identity. They talk about it. They plan for situations.\n\n\u003e We have a brand new player there ([[Kevin Fiala|Fiala]]), and some of their issues is sometimes they’re playing two different systems. Two are playing one way, the other one is trying to figure it out, and he’s jumping. It does take time to adapt, so we have to be a little more patient there.\n\n\u003e the defensive part and the chances they’re giving up have to minimize somewhat.”\n\n\u003e We are what we are, and that line has proven to be a really good line for us the way it’s made up. I don’t think they had their best night in Washington, but we also have other lines in the same category. [[Quinton Byfield|Q]], big man. He should be confident right now. He has offensive skills. It’s going to come out eventually. [[Gabe Vilardi|Gabe]] – tremendous start. Size, puck protection, good shot, much more reliably defensible on the wing, and Arthur can shoot the puck. So, the three of them have to get together and figure out what their identity might be, and we’ve talked to them about that. They’re all big guys, they all have offensive talent, they can all shoot the puck well. They should be able to hold onto pucks and wear other teams down. But sometimes it doesn’t always go that way, and they’ve got to work towards an identity.\n\n\u003e \\[Nikita Kucherov]’s Mahomes, he’s looking here and he’s passing there. He’ pumping and faking and he can throw a whole group of five players off with his deception.\n\n### [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\u003e Soo’s pretty nice, they have some nice \\[hotels] up there.\n\n\u003e \\[My brother] always makes that joke, that he’s in the ‘Always Hungry League'.\n\n\u003e That’s kind of why I’m looking over there. Kind of like ‘wow, they’re here.’\n\u003e And then I think when the puck drops, the game starts, it doesn’t even cross my mind. I’m battling in front, I’m not even thinking about it.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.762383035Z","tags":null},"/Golden-Knights-vs-Kings-Game-Recap-October-11-2022-ESPN":{"title":"Golden Knights vs Kings - Game Recap - October 11, 2022 - ESPN","content":"\n# Golden Knights vs Kings - Game Recap - October 11, 2022 - ESPN\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-11 | [[ESPN]] | [Golden Knights vs Kings - Game Recap - October 11, 2022 - ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nhl/recap/_/gameId/401458592)\n\n## Contributors\n- \n\n\n## Players\n- [[Arthur Kaliyev]]\n- [[Jonathan Quick]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Mark Stone scored the tiebreaking goal with 24.9 seconds to play, and the Vegas Golden Knights punctuated coach Bruce Cassidy's debut with a 4-3 victory over the Los Angeles Kings on Tuesday night.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e We’ve preached and preached about it.

Two D went over to the wall, and I knew if we could get the puck to me I’d be able to make a play. [[Arthur Kaliyev|Arty]] made a good delay on the wall to find me – I was calling pretty loud. … I didn’t know I was going to go back door, I just kind of made the read that was available. Vasilevskiy came out to take the angle away from me, so Blake was wide open to finish it off.\n\n\u003e I’m a bit more comfortable with reads with the puck, finding guys in the middle of the ice. I feel like I’m really good at transitioning the puck and I feel that’s been smoother, but also some of the top guys coming down on me and I’m holding them to the outside, not letting them get the middle.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e for him, for us, for the future, for now ... all that Brandt has to do is worry about practice tomorrow.\n\n\u003e Special teams, four-on-four, down by a goal, up by a goal, he seems to find his way out on the ice. So, we believe in him or obviously we wouldn’t be doing that. For us to move forward as an organization – today, tomorrow, two years from now – it has to come from underneath.\n\n\u003e [[Brandt Clarke]]'s' recovery from the mistake is what makes it impressive. He doesn’t hide, he doesn’t crumble.\n\n\u003e We had a talk with \\[[[Jaret Anderson-Dolan]]] somewhere on the road about the opportunity’s going to come, and when it does, you have to make good. We felt pretty good about him being able to do that, and he’s done it in the past.\n\n\u003e We aggressively checked, and sometimes when you ask your team to check, they back off and they’re just standing and taking it all the time. We aggressively checked.\n\u003e We were all playing the same system for the most part instead of off on our own.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.762383035Z","tags":null},"/Head-Coach-Todd-McLellan-speaks-to-the-media-after-Mondays-practice":{"title":"Head Coach Todd McLellan speaks to the media after

practice\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e Q: A few days ago, Todd, you talked about how last\nseason's Camp was about establishing the\nidentity and this year it's more about\nrediscovering from what you guys had\nlast year how have you seen that kind of\nprogress through the last preseason game\nand to now today's Final practice? \n\u003e\n\u003e A: well I think that's a process that's\ngoing to continue not just for the Kings\nbut for for every team that's beginning\nthe season you're never the finished\nproduct on day one\nand um I do think I've mentioned to a\nfew guys that day one is often uh\nyou know it's either too high or too low\nor or whatever it is day two is really\nwhere you\num\nstart to see what your team is made of\nand and how it rolls out but\nwe're at day one it's we're going to\nmake it important it obviously is we'd\nlike to see our identity come out we'd\nlike to see our structure come out we'd\nlike to see individuals find their game\nwithin our game\nthere's areas that we've concentrated a\nlittle bit more on throughout training\ncamp\nthan others and we should see\nimprovements in those areas\nor at least\nprogression towards it pardon me\num but it will take some time and um\nwe're no different than any other team\nin the league\n\n\u003e Q: Todd you talked about identity. \n\u003e The last three games were high scoring\n\u003e games, not really your identity\n\u003e Is there a lot to clean up defensively\n\u003e or is that just an offshoot of preseason? \n\u003e \n\u003e A:  there are some things to clean up\ndefensively\num some of it's game management some of\nits\num you know situational that we've got\nindividual mistake here and there not\nnecessarily the team as a whole\nuh\nsome of its games five six and seven of\nexhibition season\nyou know whatever that means I think you\nguys can figure that out\num\nyou know we have to remember who we are\nand what our identity is and play\ntowards that so\nat the end of the day at the end of the\nday that's what will take us to where we\nwant to go and if we start to stray from\nit\nuh we'll probably learn some valuable\nlessons along the way and we'll have to\nreel some things in but that's who we\nare and that's how we'll have to play\n\n\u003e Q: you uh you took a while before you were\nable to define the identity of the team\nwhat about now what is it\n\u003e\n\u003e A: well we should be really hard to play\nagainst because we're a structured team\nwe have some predictability\num to each other not necessarily to the\nopposition in what we do uh our checking\nskills are in our DNA and we value that\nand when I say we usually starts through\nthe championship players that have been\nhere before\num and it trickles all the way down\nyou can be a really sound\nresponsible trusting\nplayer on the ice and still produce\noffense [[Phillip Danault|Phil Danault]] was that\nlast year [[Adrian Kempe]] for the most part\nis that\num so start there and the offense will\ncome later on\ndo we want to score more goals of course\nwe do and we we have to\nbut if we're chasing goals all over the\nplace and giving up too many we're\nprobably uh\nyou know going to be in trouble\n\n\u003e Q: on [[Brandt Clarke|Brandt]]\nwe've talked about obviously you know\nwhat he's shown in Camp on the ice the\nskills that he has and the growth that's\nobviously there also I wrote how much\ndoes his\ndoes this confidence that there's even a\nseems to be a little bit of swagger a\nlittle little attitude whatsoever how\nmuch does that even\ncarried him\nthrough this camp and to this point\nwhere maybe he can be playing tomorrow\nnight \n\u003e\n\u003e A: I I think that that has helped him\nimmensely\num\nhe knows who Brandt knows who Brandt is he\nknows what's in his toolbox in his tool\nkit\num he hasn't played with fear and what I\nmean by fear is not the the physical\npart but fear of\nof\nerroring on the ice he makes plays he\nattempts plays uh he's been very\ncoachable throughout training camp\num you know potentially away from the\nKing's family I could see where that\nconfidence or that Swagger may be\nmisread\nin other environments\num where it could hurt him but so far\nnot in ours not one bit\n\n\u003e Q: Todd, the last few preseason games it's like a\nlot of goals in the second period I\nthink I counted 10 goals against\nanything that tendencies that were\nhappening or not happening\n\u003e\n\u003e A: um while we get off we've had good\nstarts in the exhibition season\nwe get to the break we come out and we\nwe seem to take\npenalties\npenalties that aren't really important\nin anything that's going on away from\nthe puck in the o-zone the neutral zone\nI'd like to think that that can be\ncleaned up\nthose are individuals more than team\nmistakes I'd like to think that gets\ncleaned up and um early in the year that\ncan swing the momentum a big way but\nother than that I don't have\nanything else to put my finger on\n\n\u003e Q: You just mentioned [[Phillip Danault|Danault]] and [[Adrian Kempe|Kempe]] who\n\u003e both had career seasons last year\n\u003e  what have you seen or what do you know\nabout them that means you to believe\nthat could be the norm as opposed to be\nexcept that being exceptions\n\u003e\n\u003e A: well I have a longer track record with\nAdrian and to me where Adrian the day I\nwalked in the door and Adrian was there\ntill now he's gone from boy to man in my\nopinion in his\nresponsibility for his own game has gone\nup immense immensely and I see that in\nthem so I'm confident that confidence\nthat he can carry on is he a 35 goal\nscorer I sure hope so\nbut I know he's a 20-minute player for\nsure most nights and that's just as\nimportant as being a a 35 goal scorer\nwith Phil\num\nPhil's ability to play in structure and\nread plays and be responsible for the\nother 20 minutes a night\num has always been there his breakout\nwas the offensive part and I think if he\ncontinues to do\num the things he did on the the\ndefensive side of the puck he's going to\nget those opportunities offensively as\nwell so they haven't shown signs that\nthey can't repeat\n\n\u003e Q: What are you looking to bring out of\n\u003e [[Quinton Byfield]]'s game how would you\n\u003e assess where he's at and what you want\n\u003e to see from him, I guess a blueprint this year\n\u003e\n\u003e A: well a year ago we were putting him in a\ncast and we were putting them on the\nshelf for\nfour months four and a half months\nwe're not doing that now so he's way\nfurther ahead he's bigger he's stronger\nhe's skating better he's over top of\npucks a lot more\num\nthe evaluation tool I think on the\nexteriors all these goals and assists\nand can he be that or whatever he in my\nmind is already a better player now than\nhe was last year at this point\nnow we've got to let him play and find\nhis way and\num\nthe rest should happen as the night goes\non but as the year goes on Pardon Me not\ntonight but as the year goes on\n\n\u003e Q: Todd with [[Kevin Fiala|Fiala]], he might be the only new player in your\nlineup tomorrow night\nnow that you've seen him in the\npreseason games practices for a couple\nof weeks is there anything about his\ngame that maybe he didn't know that\nyou're really appreciating\n\u003e \n\u003e A: um\nthere were\nassumptions that we made based on his\nPoint totals and video and that type of\nstuff you know the the hockey sense the\nsense of timing space finish\nthose assumptions to this point were\ngood assumptions on our behalf because\nwe've seen that so it's the overall\npackage and it's just\nthroughout exhibition season confirming\nwhat we believed we were getting and\nwhat we\nhad viewed in the past but now we see it\nfull time or if that makes any sense but\nthat's that would be my answer for that\n\n\u003e Q: the [[Viktor Arvidsson]] uh did he come back\nsooner than you as anticipated and how\ndid he look off the other off the other\nnight in terms of being able to jump in\nthe front\n\u003e\n\u003e A: um not necessarily sooner uh Victor's\nbeen on a\nfrom the day he was ruled out last year\nin whatever it was April May\ntill now he's followed pretty much the\ncalendar of events that we thought would\nhappen\num and he's worked really hard\nto get himself back into the lineup his\neagerness and excitement about being\nback in is really healthy I thought he\nhad a real good game\num no one one game\nhe's going to have to do it\nover and over again but he completes the\nidentity of that line\nthey spent a lot of time talking and and\nanalyzing how they play that's I think\nmakes them effective\nand he shown no signs of\nfatigue or anything else negative\n\n\u003e Q: this is the healthiest the roster has\nbeen a year\ngee thanks\nis it harder or easier to make decisions\nnow\nbased on everyone being available\n\u003e\n\u003e A: um\nit's a mix some players made it easy\nsome are making it harder some are\nmaking it clear both ways for and\nagainst their play\num\nI I would be lying if I said I wasn't\nconcerned about bringing all the banged\nup guys back at once [[Viktor Arvidsson|Arvy]]'s played one\ngame [[Sean Durzi|Durzi]]'s played two\nyou know these guys are coming back in\nwithout a lot of\num training camp time\nother teams are in that situation too so\nwe just got to figure it out as we go\n\n\u003e Q: when you were introduced as head coach\nyou introduced the marathon metaphor now\nit's the start of year four how far\nalong is the club in that metaphorical\nMarathon compared to where you'd like\n\u003e\n\u003e A: well we've settled into the race now\nwe've climbed some hills we've got in\nsome valleys\nI think in marathons there's\num\nplayers or players Runners that break\naway and sometimes the pack catches them\nagain I would say we're in that pack and\num you know we're no longer in miles one\nthrough five we're way further into it\nbut if crossing the finish line and\nputting a medal around your neck is the\nStanley Cup Championship we we still\nhave a lot of running to do\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.734382204Z","tags":null},"/Healthy-and-Comfortable-Akil-Thomas-Finding-Early-Season-Form-With-Ontario-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"Healthy and Comfortable,

At this point last season, Thomas was away from his Reign teammates, not cleared for contact and separately rehabbing two offseason shoulder surgeries. He had yet to make his season debut and wouldn’t for a month to come. Fast forward one year and a healthy Thomas has gotten off to an impressive start to the young AHL season, which has him beaming with pain-free confidence.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Akil Thomas]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Akil Thomas]]\n\u003e I thought it was going to be easy and a walk in the park actually, I really thought I could just be patient and I wouldn’t be effected mentally. After the \\[shoulder surgeries] it took a long time to recover. I started to be affected mentally right around training camp last season because I was away from the group and they were all on the ice together, and at that time I couldn’t even shrug my shoulders. That’s when I realized that it wasn’t going to be easy and it was going to be a long road ahead.\n\n\u003e Once I did start playing \\[in games], it was still tough because I wasn’t the same player yet and I didn’t feel like myself. It took a while to get back on my feet even when I was playing. I talked to some people to help me with my mental health to help me get back my old self and I think that was just big for me going forward. I was able to refocus, think about what kind of year I had the season prior and kind of get my thoughts towards the remainder of the season. I just tried to stay patient and come to the rink with a good attitude, a positive attitude, and use every day to get better as I continued to come back from my shoulder surgeries.\n\n\u003e I would say I didn’t feel like my total self until the rookie tournament this year (September 16-19). Even in the summer I didn’t really feel one-hundred percent, so obviously when you have two brand new shoulders it takes time to trust them. It took time for my touch for the game to come back, I think that was kind of the biggest thing for me to regain. I think my game kind of revolves around my touch, my feel and my patience with the puck. It definitely took time.\n\n\u003e Just being able to work out regularly this summer was huge, the last few summers I’ve had shoulder issues because of what I fixed last year, so this offseason was the first healthy offseason I’ve had in about four or five years. It’s been a very freeing summer and it really helped me mentally.\n\n\u003e This offseason I wanted to get faster and wanted to get stronger, especially in the upper body. I wanted to become a little bit more confident with the puck and improve skating a little bit more, which could me to make more plays with the puck and play a little bit riskier. I also wanted to build my engine up kind of, being able to last longer and be more durable during shifts. I felt like I pretty much hit all the dots in terms of my personal goals this offseason and I feel great now.\n\n\u003e We all came into the AHL at same time and you know, Madds and I have battled injuries and whatnot. I also think just like we’re more experienced being in our third year of professional hockey. In making the little plays and scoring a goal here and there that we probably wouldn’t have made a year or so ago. The experience has been the key but we’re all buddies, we all lived together in our rookie season. We want to be better for each other and I honestly think we have a lot more, as a line, I think we can do a lot better. I think we have some more in the tank, but it’s been a pleasure playing with \\[[[Aidan Dudas]]] and \\[[[Tyler Madden]]].\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.734382204Z","tags":null},"/Helene-Elliott":{"title":"Helene Elliott","content":"\n# Helene Elliott\n\n| NHL.com | Twitter |\n| ------- | ------- |\n| [Helene Elliott]() | [@twitter_handle](https://twitter.com/)\n\n| Title | Organization |\n| ----- | ------------ |\n|       |              |\n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date | Title |\n| ---- | ----- |\n|      |       |\n\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\n| Date | Title |\n| ---- | ----- |\n|      |       |\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.734382204Z","tags":null},"/Helge-Grans":{"title":"Helge Grans","content":"\n# Helge Grans\n\n| NHL.com / Ontario Reign | Twitter                                 |\n| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| [Helge Grans]()           | [@twitter_handle](https://twitter.com/) | \n\n| Player | \\#  | Position | Shoots | Height | Weight | Born | Birthplace | Draft |\n| ------ | --- | -------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ---- | ---------- | ----- |\n| [[Helge Grans]] | 3 | D | R | 6' 3\" | 205 | 2002-05-10 | Ljungby, Sweden | LAK 2nd RD, 2020 (35th)\n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n|      |      |       |\n\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\n| Date       | Site                    | Title                                                                                               |\n| ---------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-11-04 | [[LA Kings Insider]]    | [[Jordan Spence continuing to develop as a top prospect with the Ontario Reign - LA Kings Insider]] |\n| 2022-11-03 | [[Mayors Manor]]        | [[Ontario Reign - Projected Lineup vs Colorado Eagles - Fagemo Out]]                                |\n| 2022-10-21 | [[Montreal Hockey Now]] | [[Montreal Canadiens and LA Kings Could Rekindle Trade Talks]]                                      |\n| 2022-10-19 | [[Mayors Manor]]        | [[LA Kings Weekly Reign Report, October 16, 2022]]                                                  |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[Mayors Manor]]        | [[Reign Recap and Highlights - Bakersfield Hands Ontario First Loss of the Season]]                 |\n| 2022-10-14 | [[LA Kings Insider]]    | [[REIGN FINAL – Reign 8, Canucks 2 – Sturm, Tynan, Grans - LA Kings Insider]]                       |\n| 2022-10-13 | [[Hockey Royalty]]      | [[LA Kings - 2022-23 prospect rankings, 10-6]]                                                      |\n| 2022-09-22 | [[All The Kings Men]]   | [[Top 10 Questions at Training Camp and Rookie Face-Off Recap]]                                     |\n\n\n\n## Post-Draft Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n|      |      |       |\n\n\n\n## Pre-Draft Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n|      |      |       |\n\n\n## Unprocessed Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n|      |      |       |\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.734382204Z","tags":null},"/Hellebuyck-makes-40-saves-Jets-rally-past-Kings":{"title":"Hellebuyck makes 40 saves, Jets rally past Kings","content":"\n# Hellebuyck makes 40 saves, Jets rally past Kings\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-27 | [[Kings at NHL.com]] | [Hellebuyck makes 40 saves, Jets rally past Kings](https://www.nhl.com/news/winnipeg-jets-los-angeles-kings-game-recap/c-336550170) |\n| 2022-10-27 | [[Kings at NHL.com]] | [[Hellebuyck makes 40 saves, Jets rally past Kings]]                                                                                |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Dan Greenspan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Axel Jonsson-Fjallby scored the go-ahead goal in the third period of the Winnipeg Jets' 6-4 win against the Los Angeles Kings at Crypto.com Arena on Thursday.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e We still don't know how we want to play.

Tynan]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Marco Sturm]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n- [[Samuel Fagemo]]\n  \u003e He was pretty good. I thought him and Tynan had a really good game. With his shot, he’s so dangerous at five-on-five and five-on-four. Now, we have to find a way to get him even more shots like that. -- [[Marco Sturm]]\n  \n  \u003e “It feels better and better each game here. It’s such an honor to play with those guys, I’m just trying to do my best and shoot the puck and be at the right places at the right times. -- [[Samuel Fagemo]]\n  \n  \u003e I think I’m playing big minutes right now. It feels good out there and I’m just trying to improve in that area too. I think I can be even better at it. -- [[Samuel Fagemo]]\n  \n  \u003e He’s not really tall, not really big, so I think he needs to get a little bit stronger and play like a big guy. He has the shot, I think he has the hands for it, now we just need to make sure that he gets stronger and get maybe on a faster pace to play in the NHL. Sometimes it takes a little bit of time, but we try to work with him every day because he has something. So we just try to get his engine going and maybe get him to the next level. -- [[Marco Sturm]]\n- [[Rasmus Kupari]]\n- [[Lias Andersson]]\n  \u003e We had him with the Kings too and when he played on the power play, he was the net-front guy because we already saw that that’s a good spot for him. He’s very skilled, but he’s not afraid to go to the dirty areas so he deserved that rebound goal and that shows what kind of player he is. -- [[Marco Sturm]]\n- [[T.J. Tynan]]\n  \u003e He’s our best player. On a lot of teams, the best players are the team captain. We named him as the captain because we believe in him. He also has to grow and learn how to be a captain as well, and he’s up for the challenge. He’s working on it every day and that’s what we like. Guys love him, he brings a lot to the team and guys will stick up for him. -- [[Marco Sturm]]\n  \n  \u003e For the size he has and even the weight, I think he plays like a big man. If you’re the MVP for two years in a row, that shows you something. We are really happy to have him and I’m happy for him to have the chance to be the team captain for an organization. It’s the first time for him but he deserved it for sure. -- [[Marco Sturm]]\n  \n  \u003e They’re amazing players and it’s good to see \\[ [[Lias Andersson]] and [[Samuel Fagemo]]] get on the board early. For me, it’s just about using my skill set to try to get them pucks where they’re comfortable and where they like it. You get Lias the puck around the net and good things are going to happen. I actually missed Sammy a couple of times today, but if you can get him some pucks, he’s got a heck of a shot. Hopefully we get better and better each day. -- [[T.J.

If you don't have your legs, you better have your brains, and we didn't have either. That makes it a real tough night and that's going to lead to penalties. The penalty kill did not get it done. We had it on our tape numerous times to clear and it didn't come out. With that type of firepower and that type of power play, it's going to end up in your net.\n\n### [[Phillip Danault]]\n\u003e We know how good we can play and how good we can be as a team. We want to improve every game, and on a back to back, it's a great opportunity to steal points. Obviously, a disappointing ending tonight.\n\n### [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\u003e There's no need for the frustration level to be high right now. We played a good game last night. We didn't get it done tonight.

That’s pretty cool to hear coming from \\[[[Anze Kopitar]]]. He’s the best player hands down. If he’s saying that, that’s good. I just got to keep going. Hopefully I can help them out, I guess, and we can produce as a line.\n\n\u003e When I missed those … I don’t want to say three years, but I played one year of hockey over three years after my draft, I really just learned a lot about my body and now I’m more in tune, I guess would be the world. If I feel something, I know what I need to do. If something’s sore or feeling tight, I know what I need to do to kind of counteract there.\n\u003e I don’t want to say it was a blessing in disguise because I missed three years and that’s a lot of development, a lot of hockey that I missed. But I do have a better sense of my body, I think.\n\n\u003e I thought there was several months. I won’t say years. But several months where I wasn’t sure if I was going to be playing hockey for my life, which was pretty scary considering it’s all I ever known. All I ever want to do. I think that’s behind me now, though. Not really thinking about that.\n\n\u003e Throughout the year, I’ve kind of been saying the same sh-t to you guys every day.\n\n\u003e Yeah, I think I had more to prove this year. I stay off social media. I stay off all that stuff because I don’t like to read it. I don’t know who was kind of counting me on the team this year or the starting roster. I don’t know. I just worked hard this summer and taking the same mentality I had this summer into the season. And so far, it’s been good.\n\u003e Small sample size. I want to be a good player for a long time. Got to keep going.\n\n### [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\u003e I don’t think there is a more confident guy around here. Listen, it’s great to see. Obviously, he’s had a couple tough years. Couple uncertain years. The fact that he’s gotten off to a start that he is, it’s great for us. It’s great for him. We’re going to need him to keep going.\n\n### [[Craig Johnson]]\n\u003e His attitude when he was at Ontario was incredible. He was a good teammate. He never once said, ‘I don’t want to be here.’ He went about his business. He worked.\n\u003e To see him have success this year after putting in the work like he did is great.\n\n\u003e When he played for us in Ontario last year, he was very focused and dialed in on what he wanted to do. He knew he was there for a reason and some of the reasons were his checking details. We worked hard at that. We looked at video. We worked on it after practice. He worked on it during practice. It was an area that he focused on to get better.\n\u003e There’s little things. He’s becoming stronger. The way he can puck protect down low and he has such good hands and that finishing ability and his vision has always been there. He’s learning the finer details. He’s building an engine, too. He’s built his engine last year playing in Ontario. The minutes he got to play in. I’m very happy to see where he is this year.\n\n### [[Trevor Moore]]\n\u003e It’s weird. When you’re confident, the puck just finds you. It’s like following you around like a magnet. When you’re not confident, it’s like you’re chasing it all the time. It’s a weird phenomenon.\n\n\u003e I think that \\[[[Gabe Vilardi]]]’s come in with a really good head space this year. But also in the past, he’s so talented of a guy that he’s trying to go under guys’ sticks and things like that. Now he’s protecting pucks. He’s a big dude. It’s hard to push him off pucks. He’s able to stay in the O-zone for a long time when he does that, and his skill comes out from there.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e When you feel good about yourself and you believe in yourself and everybody does it, it’s magic sometimes.\n\n\u003e You can only go with what you see. With all players, you like to project and hope and all that type of stuff. But the number of setbacks that he had, you wondered.

And maybe Gabe’s time has arrived. And if it has, that’s great for him as an individual and us as an organization.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.734382204Z","tags":null},"/How-LAK-Creates-Offense":{"title":"How LAK Creates Offense","content":"\n# How LAK Creates Offense\n\n| Date       | Site                              | Link                                                                         |\n| ---------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-02-26 | [[The Hockey Tactics Newsletter]] | [How LAK Creates Offense](https://jhanhkyck.com/p/how-lak-creates-offense)                           |\n| 2022-02-26 | [[The Hockey Tactics Newsletter]] | [[How LAK Creates Offense]] |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jack Han]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e \n\n\n## Players\n- \n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n- DZ Breakout: Get off the wall, change side\n- OZ Forecheck: 2-1-2 Narrow\n- OZ Cycle: D Middle Activation\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.734382204Z","tags":null},"/How-will-Byfield-answer-The-Question":{"title":"How will Byfield answer The Question","content":"\n# How will Byfield answer The Question\n\n| Date       | Site                              | Link                                                                                                        |\n| ---------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2020-05-29 | [[The Hockey Tactics Newsletter]] | [How will Byfield answer The Question](https://jhanhky.substack.com/p/how-will-byfield-answer-the-question) |\n| 2020-05-29 | [[The Hockey Tactics Newsletter]] | [[How will Byfield answer The Question]]                                                                                                            |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jack Han]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Navigating doubt on the path to greatness\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n- Will you change your game, or will you make the game change for you?\n- So what about Byfield?\n\t1) Owning the puck\n\t2) Owning the rink\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.734382204Z","tags":null},"/Iafallo-week-to-week-for-now-returns-home-for-evaluation-Tuesday-morning-skate-updates":{"title":"Iafallo, “week-to-week for now,” returns home for evaluation -  Tuesday morning skate updates","content":"\n# Iafallo, “week-to-week for now,” returns home for evaluation -  Tuesday morning skate updates\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-18 | [[The Forum Report]] | [Iafallo, “week-to-week for now,” returns home for evaluation -  Tuesday morning skate updates](https://theforumreport.com/iafallo-week-to-week-for-now-returns-home-for-evaluation-tuesday-morning-skate-updates/) |\n| 2022-10-18 | [[The Forum Report]] | [[Iafallo, “week-to-week for now,” returns home for evaluation -  Tuesday morning skate updates]]                                                                                                                   |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jon Rosen]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Notes from the second half of the Detroit-Nashville back-to-back\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Alex Iafallo]]\n- [[Alex Edler]]\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e We’re trying hard right now as a group to find our games within our team game,” McLellan answered. “Individually, collectively as lines, we don’t want to throw a lot into the blender. I think then you’re starting all over again. Our lines will stay pretty much intact. I’ll look at filling that Iafallo spot with somebody else, whether it’s [[Arthur Kaliyev|Arthur]] or [[Carl Grundstrom|Grunny]] or [[Brendan Lemieux|Lemieux]] or somebody like that, and we’ll make that decision and then go from there. There are always the opportunity for in-game adjustments if it’s not going well.\n\n\u003e I think it takes a few regular season for non-injured players to find their games, so you can imagine what it’s like for Arvy coming off of back surgery, [[Sean Walker]], who hasn’t played hockey in a year. Those are tough situations. Now, every team has one or two of those guys, for whatever reason, and the quicker we can get ours up and running I think it can be an advantage. If we don’t get them going quickly, it’ll be a disadvantage.\n\n\u003e They buzzed, they created opportunities not only for themselves, but they handed off a real good shift to lines one and two.\n\n\u003e We didn’t win the first two while we were doing that, we won the next two, so that’s a really good sign. Offensively we’ve been able to capitalize on some of our chances, which always for our team hasn’t been an easy thing, but there are still areas to improve on.\n\n\u003e If you can stay out of the box, then you do yourself a favor. Goaltending in back-to-back games is huge. It’s the backbone of playing, especially early in the year. Other than that, it’s an old cliché, but you need everybody, especially early when your body and your mind may not be used to it.\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.734382204Z","tags":null},"/Im-not-sure-that-we-were-that-good-in-the-first-40-either-and-more-from-McLellan-Durzi-and-Dowd":{"title":"“Im not sure that we were that good in the first 40, either,” and more from McLellan, Durzi and Dowd","content":"\n# “Im not sure that we were that good in the first 40, either,” and more from McLellan, Durzi and Dowd\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-22 | [[The Forum Report]] | [“Im not sure that we were that good in the first 40, either,” and more from McLellan, Durzi and Dowd](https://theforumreport.com/im-not-sure-that-we-were-that-good-in-the-first-40-either-and-more-from-mclellan-durzi-and-dowd/) |\n| 2022-10-22 | [[The Forum Report]] | [[“Im not sure that we were that good in the first 40, either,” and more from McLellan, Durzi and Dowd]]                                                                                                                            |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jon Rosen]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings’ 4-3 loss to the Washington Capitals Saturday night at Capital One Arena will leave a bad taste in the team’s mouth, even though it closed out a successful 3-2-0 road trip. Unable to stem the momentum as well as they had earlier on the trip, Washington scored four times in 11 and a half minutes and whisked the team west, searching for solutions to shore up its leaky defense. Los Angeles has allowed fewer than four goals only once this season, the 4-3 shootout win at Nashville.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Jonathan Quick]]\n- [[Sean Durzi]]\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e Good teams make you pay for those – I don’t even know I’d call them ‘mistakes,’ but ‘lucky bounces.\n\n\u003e When we left LA last Friday, if somebody would’ve told me we’d score 20 goals on this road trip, I’d be pretty darn excited about winning a lot of games. \n\u003e I’m not sure that we were that good in the first 40, either. There were some chances, but they were fewer. It was a dead game.\n\n\u003e And we expected that from Durz. He’s a competitive young man that does a lot of things well on the ice, and he plays like every shift’s his last shift, so no complaints there.\n\n### [[Sean Durzi]]\n\u003e Just saw the open space. It’s nice to come off that left side there and finish the play. But it would’ve been a bit nicer if we’d finished the game.\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.762383035Z","tags":null},"/In-Conversation-Wolves-centre-Quinton-Byfield":{"title":"In Conversation -

the way on the blue line for Ontario has been Jordan Spence, who has taken on an even bigger role for the club than he had in his rookie campaign last season.\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Title / Internal Link                                                                               |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-11-04 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[Jordan Spence continuing to develop as a top prospect with the Ontario Reign - LA Kings Insider]] |\n\n## Players\n- [[Jordan Spence]]\n- [[Lias Andersson]]\n- [[Helge Grans]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Marco Sturm]]\n- [[Chris Hajt]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Marco Sturm]]\n\u003e \\[[[Jordan Spence]]] was outstanding, just like I know he can be.\n\n\u003e Spenny took over. He showed again that he’s an NHL defenseman and it was nice to see. I know his time will come, but we are very happy to have him, I can tell you that.\n\n### [[Jordan Spence]]\n\u003e Obviously I wanted to make the Kings but it didn’t go my way out of training camp. But it’s good for me to just get a lot of minutes here, play in these situations that can help improve my game and it’s been going really well. Going into the regular season I just wanted to play my game, just showcase what I can do on the ice.\n\n\u003e There’s obviously still some things to improve on every game that you play, but I think Coach Hajt has been trusting me in more situations than last year with penalty kill and the last couple minutes in the third period. I think it’s really good for me to have that role and take a step up from last year.\n\n\u003e I think we’re just trying to be simple. If we’re up 3-2 and they’re just trying to score, you don’t have to make fancy plays and we don’t have to do anything fancy. If we’re in trouble, we just pump pucks, we chip pucks off the glass and everything, so I think that’s really important for us and Marco has mentioned that over the past few weeks.\n\n\u003e Having that experience last year, Helge and I came in more confident. Then picking up a couple of the players like \\[Frederic] Allard and \\[Tobie] Bisson, they’re really great players and I think it’s pretty easy for us to make plays with them.

It goes up and down. The chemistry will come. We’re three good players and I can see our line being very effective. And I think tonight will be the night.\n\n\u003e I feel pretty confident in this arena,” he said. “Obviously, I played here a lot of games. It helped for sure. \n\n\u003e Some guys connect. Some guys don’t. I’ve known him a long time. We played in Milwaukee before and Nashville before. If you have time with each other as a person like off the ice and on the ice, you have more time to click. I think that was also a big reason. We like each other off the ice. On the ice as well obviously. That’s why we clicked.\n\n\u003e It was nice. Seeing the support of the fans — just nice. I enjoyed it. I had fun. But everything else was business. It’s also nice they do it in the start of the game so you can kind of let it go.\n\u003e\n\u003e I love the fans here. And I think they like me too.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e That’s a good point because we can overload with a hundred different things and that doesn’t help him. I think by this point he understands our demeanor. When I say ours, our coaching staff. But also his teammates. Who’s emotional, who isn’t. What gets guys riled up. What’s the boiling point for good and bad. And often for a player, once that gets clarified it’s a lot easier.\n\u003e \n\u003e From a technical or team standpoint, I think he’s beginning to understand our language. The game can only be played so many ways, so many systems. Often, we can confuse players with the language we use so I think he’s beginning to understand that. And then special teams for us, from a power-play perspective, there’s a lot of change for everybody. Not just for new people coming in and that being Kevin. We’re all adjusting to that.\n\n### [[Dean Evanson]]\n\u003e He’s obviously a gifted hockey player that has special skills and can score. He’s done it throughout his whole career. I’ve seen it for many years. You give him an opportunity, he’s going to put it in the net.\n\n\u003e He had a lot of adjustments as a young player coming in, not only to the NHL but obviously to North America. He’s clearly a better player than he was when he first came over.\n\n### Jonny Gaudreau\n\u003e Most important thing is his passion. He loves the game. I do too. We’ve always had fun playing together.\n\n\u003e I think it’s important for a player like him that he has a free mindset in some ways to express himself offensively because he has some of the best skills in the league. He can really just beat guys in places that normally you don’t see. So, it’s important for him to put that mindset into his game. To beat guys. Be an offensive weapon every single night.\n\u003e \n\u003e I think on my side, I was trying to allow him to do that in some ways and bring some security to that line. Sometimes maybe backing them up a little bit more and letting these guys express themselves. But it was just fun to play with a guy like that. He’s a fun guy to show up to the rink with every day. Fun game to play on the same line.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.734382204Z","tags":null},"/Kevin-Fiala-leads-Kings-past-Maple-Leafs":{"title":"Kevin Fiala leads Kings past Maple Leafs","content":"\n# Kevin Fiala leads Kings past Maple Leafs\n\n| Date       | Site              | Link                                                                                                                       |\n| ---------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-29 | [[LA Daily News]] | [Kevin Fiala leads Kings past Maple Leafs](https://www.dailynews.com/2022/10/29/kevin-fiala-leads-kings-past-maple-leafs/) |\n| 2022-10-29 | [[LA Daily News]] | [[Kevin Fiala leads Kings past Maple Leafs]]                                                                               |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Andrew Knoll]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings managed to right their ship defensively Saturday, bottling up one of the NHL’s most prolific offenses in a 4-2 win\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Cal Petersen]]\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e That was a pretty dynamic offensive team that we played against tonight. Last year we went into their building, checked pretty well and we came up with a win, then we tried to run and gun with them here and came up with a big loss. We tried to use some of last year’s approach for the game.\n\n\u003e \\[[[Cal Petersen]]] was a lot cleaner. There wasn’t anything that was seeping through him to the backside. Pucks hit him square, he looked confident, just a lot of really good things. He looked the way he should.\n\n### [[Cal Petersen]]\n\u003e A great team win. We limited chances and shots; we blocked a lot of shots there in the third when they were really pushing. That’s what got us far last year, and that’s what’s going to get us far this year.\n\n### [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\u003e It’s great to see. He’s had a couple tough years, uncertain years. The fact that he’s gotten off to the start that he has is great for us, it’s great for him and we’re going to need him to keep going.\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.734382204Z","tags":null},"/Kiffin-McGinnis":{"title":"Kiffin McGinnis","content":"\n# Kiffin McGinnis\n\n| NHL.com | Twitter |\n| ------- | ------- |\n| [Kiffin McGinnis]() | [@twitter_handle](https://twitter.com/)\n\n| Title | Organization |\n| ----- | ------------ |\n|       |              |\n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date | Title |\n| ---- | ----- |\n|      |       |\n\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\n| Date | Title |\n| ---- | ----- |\n|      |       |\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.734382204Z","tags":null},"/Kim-Nousiainen":{"title":"Kim Nousiainen","content":"\n# Kim Nousiainen\n\n| EliteProspects                                                                | Twitter                                 |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| [Kim Nousiainen](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/332966/kim-nousiainen) | [@twitter_handle](https://twitter.com/) |\n\n| Player             | \\#  | Position | Shoots | Height | Weight | Born       | Birthplace  | Draft                        |\n| ------------------ | --- | -------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ---------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- |\n| [[Kim Nousiainen]] |     | D        | L      | 5' 8\"  | 181    | 2000-11-14 | Kuopio, FIN | LAK 4th Rd 2019, 119 overall | \n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n|      |      |       |\n\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\n| Date | Site | Title |\n| ---- | ---- | ----- |\n| 2022-10-26 | [[Mayors Manor]] | [[Ontario Reign -

Through 12 games this season, they are allowing the fifth-most goals per game, worse than the likes of the Montreal Canadiens and the Chicago Blackhawks.

Prior to that, he spent the previous 10 seasons in the Player Development department. He was originally named to the coaching staff on July 10, 2006 and spent the two seasons as an Assistant Coach after serving as a Coaches Aide in 2003-04. The native of Hamilton, Ontario appeared in 771 career games, including 124 with the Kings from 2000-02, and recorded 488 points (195-293) overall. Originally selected by the St. Louis Blues in the third round (44th overall) of the 1985 NHL Entry Draft, the forward also had 22 points (7-15=22) in 40 playoff games. While at Bowling Green State University of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA), Emerson was a two-time All-American, a three-time CCHA All-Star, and a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award three times (1988-90).

He went on to play professionally for three seasons, tallying 29 points (8-21=29) in 129 ECHL appearances (Missouri Mavericks and Reading Royals) from 2014-17. In 2015-16, he made his AHL debut, skating in four games with the Springfield Falcons.\n\n\u003e Andy Johnson\nJohnson joins the Kings after spending the last five seasons serving as general manager and director of scouting for the Sioux City Musketeers of the USHL. This past season, Johnson led Sioux City to their first Clark Cup Championship in two decades and was named USHL General Manager of the Year. Johnson’s career spans nine seasons, all in the USHL, where he’s held positions in various capacities, including scout, director of scouting, assistant general manager and general manager split between Sioux City (2017-22), the Waterloo Black Hawks (2014-17) and Muskegon Lumberjacks (2013-14).\n\n\u003e Sara Hickmann\nDr. Hickmann brings over 20 years of sport psychology experience to the Kings, while also serving as Team Psychologist and Director of Mental Health and Wellness for the Los Angeles Clippers.

We'll see what happens in Dallas (on Tuesday). We knew we'd have our hands full. Obviously, they're not very happy with their game, just as we were a few games ago (in a 6-4 loss to the Winnipeg Jets on Thursday). I like the way we started, and we stuck with it. I think we checked our way to some goals, which was really important. Then down the stretch, the penalty kill came up right big. I thought 'Quicky' had a real good night. Overall, a real good night.\n\n\u003e Well, you've got to take what you're given. I think early in the year we were forcing some stuff and still getting rewarded. Tonight, we took what was there.

It’s been wild at times, it’s been strange at times and it certainly hasn’t been perfect. But, through it all, three wins from four games is three wins from four games and the Kings have a chance to make it four from five tomorrow, in a building that created a memorable victory a season ago.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Drew Doughty]]\n- [[Alex Edler]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Drew Doughty]]\n\u003e We can make this a great road trip, I think someone said good, but it’s a great road trip if we win four out of five. That’s a really good road trip. We’re not looking ahead to going home right now, we’ve got a big game against Washington and we didn’t perform well in the last game. We’re going to come out hot, that’s the plan anyway, and have a really good game.\n\n\u003e We’re just not making good decisions, they’re very fixable things, very fixable. We looked at them today, it’s actually kind of embarrassing how many things we’re messing up defensively. That’s not our M.O., that’s not how LA Kings hockey is played. We’re a good defensive team and yes, we want to improve on the offense that we have, but we need to get back to playing good defense.\n\n\u003e When you’re playing a lot of games like this, we don’t have a lot of time off, so I think it’s important to get rest on practice days sometimes. Yes, practice is important too, to sharpen up, but we’ll be able to get pregame states in and I think it was a good day. We got to have some fun, still got a sweat in like we would have on the ice, it was just more fun.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e It is \\[different] the way the schedule rolled out, the CBA mandates a certain amount of days off and we respect that for sure. The players need rest and we haven’t had a lot of practice time, so some would think ‘well why did you not skate today’. We just thought our energy would be a lot better by doing what we did. Using up the four days off in the short month of October, we had to pick some of these days on the road trip to give them days off and therefore it’s been a different type of trip. But, it has a chance to be a real successful trip if we play the way we can get the results we need.\n\n\u003e Well, we had two off-ice training sessions. We had one in the video room that was really important, where we addressed some of our shortcomings, things that we need to prepare and improve on. Then, we went outside, we got 15 or 20 minutes of a workout in, it’s a beautiful day here in Washington, there was a park nearby. I think sometimes that can really energize a group, especially at the back end of a trip. First trip of the year has been a long one and everything is about being ready to play tomorrow and being fresh. I think the guys enjoyed it, appreciated it and now the proof will be in the pudding to see if we have the energy we need in game five tomorrow.\n\n\u003e There are so many things \\[we focus on] and keep in mind. I think when you think about a meeting, you’re just thinking negative and it isn’t that way. We did a lot of things well in that first period yesterday as far as the forecheck goes and the tenacity on the forecheck, the ability to keep plays alive. It changed when we went down three, we lost a little bit of the belief and we can fix that. There are commonalities on both sides, special teams, power play, penalty kill faceoffs, 4-on-4 play, overtime, stuff we’ve dug into but not enough. That’ll happen when we get home.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.734382204Z","tags":null},"/Kings-goalie-Cal-Petersen-starts-in-victory-over-Toronto":{"title":"Kings goalie Cal Petersen starts in victory over Toronto","content":"\n# Kings goalie Cal Petersen starts in victory over Toronto\n\n| Date       | Site              | Link                                                                                                                                                       |\n| ---------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-29 | [[LA Daily News]] | [Kings goalie Cal Petersen starts in victory over Toronto](https://www.dailynews.com/2022/10/29/kings-goalie-cal-petersen-starts-in-victory-over-toronto/) |\n| 2022-10-29 | [[LA Daily News]] | [[Kings goalie Cal Petersen starts in victory over Toronto]]                                                                                               |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Andrew Knoll]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Looking to improve their hand, the Kings shuffled the deck ahead of their matchup with the Toronto Maple Leafs on Saturday, making changes in literally every area of their lineup.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Cal Petersen]]\n- [[Jonathan Quick]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Rasmus Kupari]]\n- [[Sean Walker]]\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Kevin Weekes]]\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Kevin Weekes]]\n\u003e I love Cal’s skill set.

I’m still doing video with the coaches; I still feel part of the team. So, I’m just going day by day, enjoying my experience right now, the ‘welcome to the NHL’ kind of time. I’m really happy with how everything is, I’m happy to be on this team and we’re going to just keep going from here.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e He’s a good liar.

Byfield earned the 3C role coming out of training camp and took some noticeable strides early in the season, as he formed an effective third line with Alex Iafallo on the left and Gabe Vilardi on the right. Byfield appeared in each of the team’s first eight games this season, tallying three assists, but has not played since October 25 due to illness, which caused him to miss each of the team’s last six games.\n\n| Date | Site | Title / Internal Link | \n| ---- | ---- | --------------------- |\n| 2022-11-06 | [[LA Kings Insider]]    | [[Kings loan forward Quinton Byfield to AHL-Ontario - LA Kings Insider]]                                    |\n\n## Players\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e He’s back \\[on the ice], which is a great sign. He lost a lot of weight and he’s going to need to get strong again. He’s going to need some time to recover.\n\n\u003e I’ve always said I don’t think anybody should lose their spot to injury or illness, it’s outside of their control. Usually you lose your spot in the lineup based on indifferent play, so we’ll see when eveybody gets back. There’s no decision that has to be made right now on Quinton or \\[[[Rasmus Kupari|Ras]]] or anybody else in our lineup, because \\[Byfield] is not yet ready to play.\n\n\u003e I’d like to do that with Iafallo and anybody that’s out, Sammy Fagemo in the minors, Turcotte, we want to get them all up to speed, because they’re all important players and Q is no different than anybody else. He needs energy, he needs strength and he’s got to feel good about himself.

We were staying on the bench for ‘O Canada.’ You look up. The whole crowd is wearing orange. Singing ‘O Canada.’ You actually had goosebumps in there. How loud it was.\n\u003e \n\u003e You watched it all growing up. Stanley Cup playoffs. To be one of the 16 teams left, it was really exciting. I’m looking forward to being back there every other year.\n\n\u003e I look at it like it’s kind of a good thing for me as well. I’m getting to know all the younger prospects as well. They said they want me to have a leadership role here. I kind of look forward to that and progress in my career with that leadership role as well.\n\u003e \n\u003e I’m looking at it like that and I see a lot of positive this weekend. Just play a couple games before training camp and before the season. Get the feel before. Maybe have a step on everyone else and be in game shape.\n\n\u003e I had the whole short side. I don’t know if I whiffed or it just bounced over my stick or whatever. No, it definitely sucks. You want to score. I think the goalie had my number this game as well. He made a lot of saves on me.\n\n\u003e I just feel more confident in just holding onto pucks. Protection. Just more confident in the corners. And just being at home. Just working with a lot of other pros. Really good players. Just being able to do the protection against them and just keep up to their level. Definitely playing with quite a bit of confidence.\n\n\u003e I feel like confidence is a huge thing is hockey and just in sports as well. If you have that, you have the swagger to make any play. You walk around just with confidence. I feel like I lost that a little bit last year.\n\u003e \n\u003e I wasn’t really playing like how I know I’ve played and how I’ve played my whole life growing up. I feel good now and I feel confident again. I just want to continue that into the season.\n\n### [[Marco Sturm]]\n\u003e It’s very important to have a guy like him in the lineup and having him around too, all weekend. I think he already is taking charge on the ice and off the ice. And I think it’s just going to help him as a hockey player and as a person. I’m very pleased that he’s around.\n\n\u003e I thought he was our best forward. I know he didn’t score and didn’t have a point. But he’s good. He’s very demanding. And he should be. If not, then we’re in trouble.\n\u003e \n\u003e But I got to say he came in really good shape. He worked really hard this summer. I can tell. We can all tell. Hopefully he’s going to grab that spot with the Kings and make that next step.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.734382204Z","tags":null},"/Kings-look-to-settle-in-vs.-Seattle-after-sloppy-opener":{"title":"Kings look to settle in vs. Seattle after sloppy opener","content":"\n# Kings look to settle in vs. Seattle after sloppy opener\n\n| Date       | Site              | Link                                                                                                                                                    |\n| ---------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-12 | [[LA Daily News]] | [Kings look to settle in vs. Seattle after sloppy opener](https://www.dailynews.com/2022/10/12/kings-look-to-settle-in-vs-seattle-after-sloppy-opener/) |\n| 2022-10-12 | [[LA Daily News]] | [[Kings look to settle in vs. Seattle after sloppy opener]]                                                                                             |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Andrew Knoll]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e After a mistake-laden opening-night loss to Vegas, the Kings hope to rebound against the Kraken on Thursday.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\u003e We’ll correct that for sure.

There’s time when there’s risk involved in it, but we don’t play risk at all, we just assume everything’s going to work out fine and it comes back the other way, three times in two power plays\n\n\u003e If you don’t understand risk, you don’t play risk and you’re not responsible for risk, and that’s what happens.\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.734382204Z","tags":null},"/Kings-open-season-with-heartbreaking-loss-to-Golden-Knights-Los-Angeles-Times":{"title":"Kings open season with heartbreaking loss to Golden Knights - Los Angeles Times","content":"\n\n# Kings open season with heartbreaking loss to Golden Knights - Los Angeles Times\n\n| Date       | Site         | Link                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| ---------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[LA Times]] | [Kings open season with heartbreaking loss to Golden Knights - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-10-11/kings-season-opener-golden-knights-stanley-cup) |\n| 2022-10-11 | [[LA Times]] | [[Kings open season with heartbreaking loss to Golden Knights - Los Angeles Times]]                                                                                                      |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Helene Elliott]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Phillip Danault]]\n- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e When Todd McLellan was hired to coach the downtrodden Kings in 2019, he compared them to marathon runners at Mile 1. With a hard-fought playoff series loss behind him and the deepest, most skillful lineup he has had at his disposal, McLellan updated that analogy as he began his fourth season.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e We’ve settled into the race now. We’ve climbed some hills. We got in some valleys. I think in marathons there’s runners that break away and sometimes the pack catches them again. I would say we’re in that pack. We’re no longer in Miles 1 through 5. We’re way further into it.\n\u003e \n\u003e But if crossing the finish line and putting a medal around your neck is the Stanley Cup championship, we still have a lot of running to do. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e We wasted an outstanding goaltending effort by not getting a point tonight. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e We made a step last year but now we have to make sure we’re taking the ability to move past that and keep that going. I think there’s less and less concerns through our lineup. I think there still are at different times and there will be at times as the season goes on, but I do think we have players that can fill some certain roles and we do have some depth in the right positions if needed. -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\u003e I think Rob has made some really good moves and it just shows us that he believes in us and he spent that money for a really good player that we needed. Rob did a big move, and now it’s our time to show it on the ice. -- [[Phillip Danault]]\n\n\u003e Yes, I can do it again. I can’t wait to see what this year is going to bring, and obviously I’m waiting for what I’ve wanted to achieve my whole life — winning the Cup. -- [[Phillip Danault]]\n\n\u003e We definitely have an expectation of Phil that now increases offensively, but I think a lot of it surrounds around his leadership. I felt that he added a big touch to that. That created excitement some of those players bought in. And now we have to get that out of Kevin Fiala, we have to get it out of some of our young guys who are going to take a little bit more prominent roles on the team. -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\u003e Is he a 35-goal scorer? I sure hope so. But I know he’s a 20-minute player for sure most nights, and that’s just as important as being a 35-goal scorer. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e When you get into tight situations or an overtime situation and you’re relying on a big player to step up, he’s now at that level for us. -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.734382204Z","tags":null},"/Kings-outlast-Panthers-win-on-Gabriel-Vilardis-goal":{"title":"Kings outlast Panthers, win on Gabriel Vilardis goal","content":"\n# Kings outlast Panthers, win on Gabriel Vilardis goal\n\n| Date       | Site | External Link                                                                                                                                   |\n| ---------- | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-11-06 | [[Field Level Media]]     | [*Kings outlast Panthers, win on Gabriel Vilardis goal*](https://fieldlevelmedia.com/news/kings-outlast-panthers-win-on-gabriel-vilardis-goal/) |\n\n## Contributors\n- \n\n## Summary\n\u003e Gabriel Vilardi scored on a sharp-angle rebound with 3:18 left as the host Los Angeles Kings beat the Florida Panthers 5-4 on Saturday night.\n\u003e Game Recap\n\n| Date | Site | Title / Internal Link | \n| ---- | ---- | --------------------- |\n| 2022-11-06 | [[Field Level Media]]   | [[Kings outlast Panthers, win on Gabriel Vilardis goal]]     |\n\n## Players\n- \n\n## Staff\n- \n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.734382204Z","tags":null},"/Kings-recall-Jacob-Moverare-from-Ontario-+-Alexes-out-tonight-Iafallo-to-IR-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"Kings recall Jacob Moverare from Ontario + Alexes out tonight, Iafallo to IR - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# Kings recall Jacob Moverare from Ontario + Alexes out tonight, Iafallo to IR - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-18 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [Kings recall Jacob Moverare from Ontario + Alexes out tonight, Iafallo to IR - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/18/kings-recall-jacob-moverare-from-ontario-alexes-out-tonight-iafallo-to-ir/) |\n| 2022-10-18 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[Kings recall Jacob Moverare from Ontario + Alexes out tonight, Iafallo to IR - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                                                 |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Kings Head Coach Todd McLellan shared this morning that neither defenseman Alex Edler nor forward Alex Iafallo would play tonight in Nashville.

Obviously a little more motivated playing against them, my old team, but it was good. A good first step in our direction and myself as well, and now we just have to build from it. -- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n\u003e If you'd have told us we were going to score seven goals, I'd have been jumping for joy. The giving up the six isn't the ideal recipe. That's a really hard game to explain. I'm not sure that we're going to give six goals up and win a game again this year. … Strange night. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e Everybody struggled, right? You get seven goals scored on, your team struggles. To pin it on one guy or one guy didn't play well from the goalie out … everybody didn't play well, or else we would have not given up seven goals. -- [[Dean Evanson]]\n\n\u003e Offensively, it was a really good game for us, so that was a step in the right direction for us. On the other side of the puck, I think there are still some things we can improve, but you know, I think we deserved the win tonight. Even if it was 1-0 or 7-6, it doesn't matter right now. That's a huge first win. We got better in all three zones, and that was a good thing. -- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.738382323Z","tags":null},"/Kings-seek-balance-between-increased-offensive-point-production-from-blueline-and-limiting-goals-against-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"Kings seek balance between increased offensive point production from blueline and limiting goals against - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# Kings seek balance between increased offensive point production from blueline and limiting goals against - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-24 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [Kings seek balance between increased offensive point production from blueline and limiting goals against - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/24/kings-seek-balance-between-increased-offensive-point-production-from-blueline-limiting-goals-against/) |\n| 2022-10-24 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[Kings seek balance between increased offensive point production from blueline and limiting goals against - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                                                                            |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Last season saw the LA Kings rank 28th in points by defensemen, with only the Detroit Red Wings getting fewer goals from their blueliners than the 21 scored by the Kings.

We’ve allowed our D to be aggressive, with that in mind. It coincides with the forwards being responsible as the D are aggressive. We’ve offensively had some reward for that, but we’ve also paid the price at the other end. At some point there has to be a balance.\n\n\u003e \\[[[Matt Roy]]]’s got a really heavy shot and we’re asking him to use it more, I think we saw that \\[in Nashville]. He has some confidence and our D has been in flux a little bit, trying to find steady partner, but I think \\[the offense] is in Matt’s game. He’s shown that in the past and we saw it \\[in Nashville].\n\n### [[Drew Doughty]]\n\u003e That’s our job as defenseman, that’s what we’re supposed to do, we’re supposed to defend the other team. Yeah, we’re supposed to get some points too and be more offensive but we need to get back to playing better defense, that’s really what our weakness is right now and we need to sharpen it up. It’s easy to balance the two out, don’t take high risks, make the right play at the right time and when you can jump in offensively, you can’t jump in and create offense from nothing, you’ve got to be smart about it.\n\n\u003e We do need to help with the offense, there’s no doubt about that, but our main priority is defending our end. Usually if you do all the right things and play the right way, points will come your way. Maybe not as much in our organization because we’re more of a defense-oriented team, but we need to get it back.\n\n\u003e They don’t have to affect each other, but obviously that happens when we jump in at the wrong times and things like that. We have a pretty defensively responsible identity and that’s something we’ll stick to. It’ll allow us to play offense and have the right cover for when we’re defending.\n\n### [[Mikey Anderson]]\n\u003e A big part of it is forecheck, trying to keep a play alive if it comes out the weak side or if there’s a way for us to try and help out, I think the coaches want us doing that. I think we’ve gotten more comfortable with the structure and as a group, we’re comfortable with each other where we’re confident and trusting that the forwards to cover for us.\n\n### [[Sean Durzi]]\n\u003e In the Pittsburgh game, the decisions we were making offensively were affecting us defensively. I know the game was kind of out of our hands, so maybe that’s why it was happening, but it was happening way too often. We were losing guys for 3-on-2’s, 2-on-1’s, breakaways against. If we want to be more aggressive, we need them to cover and we need to be smarter about our aggression as well\n\n\u003e I think if we do a good job with that it’ll allow the defense to contribute offensively, that’ll come in spurts. You want to help offensively but I think our identity is being defensively responsible, so it’s something we’ll take care of.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.738382323Z","tags":null},"/Kings-seek-better-discipline-in-road-trip-finale-in-Chicago":{"title":"Kings seek better discipline in road-trip finale in Chicago","content":"\n# Kings seek better discipline in road-trip finale in Chicago\n\n| Date       | Site              | Link                                                                                                                                                             |\n| ---------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-11-02 | [[LA Daily News]] | [Kings seek better discipline in road-trip finale in Chicago](https://www.dailynews.com/2022/11/02/kings-seek-better-discipline-in-road-trip-finale-in-chicago/) |\n| 2022-11-02 | [[LA Daily News]] | [[Kings seek better discipline in road-trip finale in Chicago]]                                                                                                  |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Andrew Knoll]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Kings have taken an NHL-worst 60 penalties, part of which led to three power-play goals in Tuesday's loss in Dallas\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Phillip Danault]]\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Phillip Danault]]\n\u003e Yeah, (it’s disappointing), especially because we know how good we can play and how good we can be as a team.

Another season of LA Kings hockey is upon us, and fans are enthusiastic about what lies ahead. Much of that excitement stems from a few talented young prospects from the Kings’ pipeline starting to emerge in the NHL. \n\n\n## Players\n- [[Martin Chromiak]]\n- [[Alex Turcotte]]\n- [[Samuel Fagemo]]\n- [[Jordan Spence]]\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n- [[Martin Chromiak]]\n  \u003e Showcasing the fact that he is done with junior hockey, Chromiak tore up the OHL last season with 44 goals and 86 points. He won’t be an offensive catalyst at the next level, but he plays a very important role, the ultimate complimentary player. It takes a lot of skill and patience to ride shotgun with highly talented play drivers, but Chromiak has proven able to do so. He may play middle six minutes at the NHL level eventually, being in the right place at the right time for his star teammates and finishing the opportunities he gets. -- [[Tony Ferrari]]\n- [[Alex Turcotte]]\n  \u003e Turcotte, when healthy, plays a tenacious, playmaking game built around a consistent effort level and a strong sense for leveraging timing and spacing to his advantage. -- [[Scott Wheeler]]\n- [[Samuel Fagemo]]\n  \u003e I’m glad Fagemo got into some NHL action last year because his goal-scoring abilities deserved a shot. We know he can drive offense and has a great shot, and I’d expect he’ll get more NHL games this year. I’d like to see more improvements in the defensive zone, but Fagemo is someone to watch, for sure. -- [[Steven Ellis]]\n- [[Jordan Spence]]\n  \u003e He got a taste of NHL action and did seem overwhelmed at times during his 24-game stint, but he was also nearly a point-per-game defender at the AHL level. Spence is a fleet-footed blueliner who moves the puck effectively with his passing ability or his mobility. He reads play at a very high level and should be able to contribute to the NHL roster in a bigger way this year should injuries arise, and he is forced into action, but another season dominating the AHL and rounding out his play in the defensive zone will go a long way in his development. -- [[Tony Ferrari]]\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n  \u003e Clarke is a special talent who possesses the unique ability to both see plays that others don’t see and then execute them. He’s a highly gifted puck transporter and distributor who makes opposing pressure miss with subtle fakes and a unique knack for sliding laterally. -- [[Scott Wheeler]]","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.738382323Z","tags":null},"/LA-Kings-4-Predators-3-SO-Matt-Roy-Cal-Petersen-shine-in-win":{"title":"LA Kings 4, Predators 3 SO - Matt Roy, Cal Petersen shine in win","content":"\n# LA Kings 4, Predators 3 SO - Matt Roy, Cal Petersen shine in win\n\n| Date       | Site               | Link                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| ---------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-19 | [[Hockey Royalty]] | [LA Kings 4, Predators 3 SO - Matt Roy, Cal Petersen shine in win](https://hockeyroyalty.com/2022/10/19/takeaways-la-kings-4-predators-3-so-matt-roy-cal-petersen-shine-in-win/) |\n| 2022-10-19 | [[Hockey Royalty]] | [[LA Kings 4, Predators 3 SO - Matt Roy, Cal Petersen shine in win]]                                                                                                             | \n\n## Contributors\n- [[Ryan Sikes]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings stormed back from a two-goal deficit in the third period, eventually taking the game in the shootout behind solid performances from Matt Roy and Cal Petersen.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Matt Roy]]\n- [[Cal Petersen]]\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e At the end of the night, \\[[[Cal Petersen]]] had to make outstanding saves in overtime, and he was excellent in the shootout, and he’s won two games for us. So, for as much it’s been talked that he’s got to find his game, he’s won two twice, and that’s a real good thing. I think he started to settle in. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e It’s not often that we’re talking about Matt scoring two to tie the game in the third period, but he has that ability. He’s got tremendous legs, he’s strong, he went to the net, and he knows the score, he can gamble a little bit more, and he did a real good job. Big night for him. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.738382323Z","tags":null},"/LA-Kings-5-Red-Wings-4-OT-Danault-scores-twice-bails-out-Arvidsson":{"title":"LA Kings 5, Red Wings 4 OT - Danault scores twice, bails out Arvidsson","content":"\n# LA Kings 5, Red Wings 4 OT - Danault scores twice, bails out Arvidsson\n\n| Date       | Site               | Link                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| ---------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-18 | [[Hockey Royalty]] | [LA Kings 5, Red Wings 4 OT - Danault scores twice, bails out Arvidsson](https://hockeyroyalty.com/2022/10/18/la-kings-5-red-wings-4-ot-danault-scores-twice-bails-out-arvidsson/) |\n| 2022-10-18 | [[Hockey Royalty]] | [[LA Kings 5, Red Wings 4 OT - Danault scores twice, bails out Arvidsson]]                                                                                                         |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Ryan Sikes]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings needed overtime after Viktor Arvidsson‘s blunder led to the Red Wings’ game-tying goal late in the game.

I’m more comfortable with the puck, making plays, and we’re starting to get our groove back, me, Phil, and Mooresy. We’re starting to feel better. -- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n- Defensive Regression\n\u003e We’re leaving the goalies out to dry at times, they’re making big saves, sometimes they’re going in, but we’ve got to be better defensively. I know guys want to get their points and play offense, but that’s not how you win games, in my opinion. We’re not a team that’s going to win games 6-5, we need to be a team that’s giving up two or three goals a night, and that’s the most that we’re giving up. I’m not the only one preaching that, everyone’s preaching that. It’s something we know we need to fix.  -- [[Drew Doughty]]\n- Problems in Net\n  \u003e I guess with Cal, there’s no secret. We’ve got to get him going. He’s got to play like he can play. He’s an NHL goaltender […] and we’re trying to get him to where he can be, and he has to be better.

Short and undoubtedly not sweet. But after the Kings were on the wrong end of a 6-1 game against Pittsburgh, it’s what you would expect.\n\u003e Calling out his goaltender? That’s not what you would expect, but McLellan didn’t mince words about Cal Petersen, who got pulled after the first period.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Cal Petersen]]\n- [[Carl Grundstrom]]\n- [[Brendan Lemieux]]\n- [[Blake Lizotte]]\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e I guess with Cal, it’s no secret we’ve got to get him going. He’s got to play like he can play. He’s an NHL goaltender. He’s an outstanding young man that’s played extremely well at this level. And we’re trying, just like we would with forwards and defensemen, to get him to where he can be. And he has to be better.\n\u003e I can’t stand here and bull—- you guys. It is what it is. But there’s others that have to be better as well in certain situations. We had the momentum, and we couldn’t close it.\n\n\u003e Obviously, the group was disappointed. We can’t go down three. It’s as simple as that. We came in between periods talking about some of the things that we haven’t seen almost all year from our group and we’re down by three. So, we’re still figuring a lot of things out.\n\n\u003e When I look at the start we had, I thought we played the way we wanted to play. We played fast. We were aggressive. Forced them into situations where they had to turn the puck over and things were going pretty well for us. Even after the first goal, I thought we responded well. But by the time it got to three, unfortunately it wasn’t the same way anymore.\n\u003e Obviously, we’d like to have a couple of those back in the first period. Even if we’re coming out of it at one (down), I think we’re in a much better state mentally.\n\n\u003e They deserved to be there.\n\u003e They had a real good night. Not a lot of complaints about those three. If \\[ [[Carl Grundstrom]], [[Brendan Lemieux]], and [[Blake Lizotte]] ] can keep that going, we got one thing that we don’t have to worry about.\n\n### [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\u003e Stuff like that’s going happen. It was frustrating obviously and then coming out for the second, you’re trying to do something. It just wasn’t meant to be tonight.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.738382323Z","tags":null},"/LA-Kings-D-pair-changes-playing-with-structure-must-happen":{"title":"LA Kings - D-pair changes, playing with structure must happen","content":"\n# LA Kings - D-pair changes, playing with structure must happen\n\n| Date       | Site               | Link                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ---------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-29 | [[Hockey Royalty]] | [LA Kings - D-pair changes, playing with structure must happen](https://hockeyroyalty.com/2022/10/29/la-kings-d-pair-changes-playing-with-structure-must-happen/) |\n| 2022-10-29 | [[Hockey Royalty]] | [[LA Kings - D-pair changes, playing with structure must happen]]                                                                                                 |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Luke Platt]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings have given up an unacceptable 39 goals against so far this season (which is good for 4.3 goals against per game).

They will have another in 2021 first-rounder, Brandt Clarke. The 19-year-old has reportedly made the team’s 23-man roster for Opening Night.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Rob Blake]]\n\u003e “I think we have some experience on our staff. I think Trent Yawney has done a terrific job with some young D and the different organizations he’s been in, so we’ve relied on his help on that. Jim Heller went through the situation with the young D on the Islanders a couple of years ago. So basically, it comes down to making sure when he does get in a lineup, he’s going to get the right amount of minutes to keep developing.\n\n\u003e I think his play through rookie camp and training camp put him to a level where we want to see him in the NHL and that kind of went into the decision process. But now the step is to make sure that it keeps going that way, and we’ll let that play out here the first little while and probably have to reevaluate again.\n\n\u003e I think he can play in all situations, use him a lot on the penalty kill, which can give you an opportunity to get the minutes needed to keep developing at the NHL level. The powerplay, obviously, you see the deception and his hockey IQ in that. But also defending, good in his sense. He’s gonna have to learn to protect himself a little bit more. Guys are bigger and stronger at this level than in junior.\n\u003e But I think the all-around game, there’s a lot of aspects that would allow a player, when he does get in a lineup in the regular season, to maintain those minutes that are going to help progress.\n\n\u003e We’ve tried quite a few over there. Sean Walker has played there at times. I think we gotta get him comfortable coming back from knee surgery before we experiment again with the left side. Sean Durzi, you saw the last game slide over there and made that transition really easy. And we’ve used Brandt Clark a couple of times over there. So the availability to open up that left side within our defense can increase getting Brandt in the lineup and getting the minutes he needs.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.738382323Z","tags":null},"/LA-Kings-Kopitar-aim-to-correct-mistakes-Notes-on-Quick-Vilardi-Fiala":{"title":"LA Kings, Kopitar aim to correct mistakes - Notes on Quick, Vilardi, Fiala","content":"\n# LA Kings, Kopitar aim to correct mistakes - Notes on Quick, Vilardi, Fiala\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-14 |  | [LA Kings, Kopitar aim to correct mistakes - Notes on Quick, Vilardi, Fiala](https://hockeyroyalty.com/2022/10/12/la-kings-kopitar-aim-to-correct-mistakes-plus-notes-on-quick-vilardi-fiala/)\n2022-10-12 | [[Hockey Royalty]] | [[LA Kings, Kopitar aim to correct mistakes - Notes on Quick, Vilardi, Fiala]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Ryan Sikes]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n- [[Jonathan Quick]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Sean Durzi]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Todd McLellan didn’t mince words following the game, calling the game’s fourth goal “stupidity” on his team’s part.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\n\u003e We’ll get it corrected for sure. You can chalk it up to a first game and all of that, but the bottom line is we just can’t afford to lose a game like that with the amount of mistakes that we made. -- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\n\u003e Well, the end result because we were still in it at the end of the night, so losing the game that we got an outstanding effort by our goaltender, and we still had a chance to win and had a chance on point, really. Obviously, the focus is going to be on the play at the end, which makes no sense, it’s hard to defend it, but our team gave up 51 shots on goal tonight. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e He’s proven it for 15 years, so it’s certainly something that we’ve talked about before and I’m sure we’re going to talk about it again moving forward. -- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\n\u003e I just came (to camp) with the mentality to take it day-by-day. I felt like I put so much pressure on myself since I turned pro, honestly. So, just coming in and playing. That’s it. -- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n\n\u003e While I’ve seen him in a number of games, I guess this will be the first one for regular season and the fans.

Currently, the Kings and Reign have a combined 17 rostered players at 22 years old or younger. Among them, we recognize notable performances and storylines. \n\n\n## Players\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n- [[Jordan Spence]]\n- [[Samuel Fagemo]]\n- [[Francesco Pinelli]]\n- [[Aatu Jamsen]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.738382323Z","tags":null},"/LA-Kings-Prospect-Report-11-4":{"title":"LA Kings Prospect Report, 11-4","content":"\n# LA Kings Prospect Report, 11-4\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                          |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-11-04 | [[Kings at NHL.com]] | [*LA Kings Prospect Report, 11-4*](https://www.nhl.com/kings/news/la-kings-prospect-report-114/c-337188610) |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jack Jablonski]]\n\n## Summary\n\u003e While the LA Kings are off and running at the NHL level, so are their prospects, playing in a variety of leagues around the world.

Lucky enough it went in.\n\n### [[Matt Roy]]\n\u003e You can look at the video. It’s a dirty play. You can see him poke Quickie in the eye there. Hopefully the league takes a look at it. It’s a dirty play.\n\n### [[Trevor Moore]]\n\u003e He just seems to always be in the middle of those things. It’s probably not always coincidence. He plays hard. It’s just part of his game. You just got to deal with it.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e It’s what he does,. It makes him a good player. Makes him a villain. Do we like the poke in (Quickie)’s face mask? Of course we don’t. But I don’t think it’s anything that we can deal with now. Other people have to look at it.\n\n\u003e Pros and cons. Great to see him score a goal because I think he was a little disappointed that he turned the puck over in the neutral zone. But he continues to check well. He uses his legs real well and provides us some pace. Gets involved in the forecheck. Kevin seems to be finding him now so there’s some chemistry there.\n\n\u003e [[Quinton Byfield|Q]]’s no different than anybody else. But he needs energy and he needs strength. He’s got to feel good about himself.\n\n\u003e It’s called competition. And I think that’s what we want.\n\u003e It happens every summer. And some of the players in this organization have had it pretty good because as the teardown happens, players have to play. You have to dress 20 players a night so maybe some that wouldn’t have gotten an opportunity got the opportunity. But we’re not at that stage anymore. And I’m just talking in generalities. I’m not talking about Kup or anybody else. Now when you bring in Danault and you bring in Fiala, you’re bringing in top-six players. Everybody gets probably put where they need to be put in the lineup and that’s what you hope for as an organization.\n\u003e Part of that is the evolution of young prospects. When you’ve spent four or five years stockpiling prospects, you have a number of them. And they can’t all play at once. For different reasons, whether it’s waivers, cap, play, indifferent play, players go up and down. And we’ll use every tool we possibly can.\n\n\u003e Well, I’ve always said, I don’t think anybody should lose their spot to injury or illness. It’s out of their control. You lose your spot in a lineup based on indifferent play. So, we’ll see when everybody gets (back). There’s no decision that has to be made right now based on Quinton or Ras or anybody else in our lineup because he’s not ready to play.\n\n### [[Rasmus Kupari]]\n\u003e Obviously, it was great to get a call-up after those six games I spent with Ontario. It tells that I’ve done something right down there. Just try to take advantage of it. Just bring my energy to the team and try to help that way. Play my game. I know the system so there’s nothing new in it. Try to be confident. Don’t be scared of anything.\n\u003e I had good games down there. It was good. Built my confidence up. Played big minutes there. Just try to bring that here as well.\n\n\u003e I get that. There’s a lot of good guys in here. Young guys. Older guys. Veterans. Good mix of guys. It’s not easy to crack the lineup. Obviously, there was disappointment. Didn’t make the team off of camp but did some right things down with the Reign. Just tried to go day by day. Stay positive and work hard and get better.\n\u003e I do that now as well. Trying to bring my game here and hopefully can stay here.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.738382323Z","tags":null},"/LA-Kings-Recall-Defenseman-Jacob-Moverare-Place-Alex-Iafallo-on-IR":{"title":"LA Kings Recall Defenseman Jacob Moverare, Place Alex Iafallo on IR","content":"\n# LA Kings Recall Defenseman Jacob Moverare, Place Alex Iafallo on IR\n\n| Date       | Site               | Link                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-89 | [[Hockey Royalty]] | [LA Kings Recall Defenseman Jacob Moverare, Place Alex Iafallo on IR](https://hockeyroyalty.com/2022/10/18/la-kings-recall-defenseman-jacob-moverare-place-alex-iafallo-on-ir/) |\n| 2022-10-18 | [[Hockey Royalty]] | [[LA Kings Recall Defenseman Jacob Moverare, Place Alex Iafallo on IR]]                                                                                                         |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Ryan Sikes]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings have added a left-shot defenseman to their NHL roster, recalling Jacob Moverare from the AHL, the team announced on Tuesday.

Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings scored three straight goals in the final two periods, earning a complete team 4-2 win against the Tampa Bay Lightning on Tuesday. With the win, the Kings also ended a 10-game losing streak to the Lightning.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n- [[Arthur Kaliyev]]\n- [[Blake Lizotte]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n- Gabe Vilardi PPG\n  \u003e I can’t say enough about the young man, he’s been outstanding since training camp. The fact that Arvy wasn’t able to go after warmup, it was a bit of a surprise to us, but things got shuffled quickly, and he has the toolkit to be playing up there. He’s got a lot of confidence on the power play right now, he’s checking well, using his body, his size. I think, as he leaves the rink every day, he’s really enjoying the game, and he’s earned it. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n- Brandt Clarke's Assist\n  \u003e Arty made a nice play to find me with a lot of time and space. Really gave me a good amount of time to read my options. I saw Lizzo backdoor because the D cheated off to me. Good play all around, good play by him. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n- Kings kill off 5-on-3\n  \u003e I thought our penalty kill was very good against an outstanding \\[power play]. There were a whole bunch of good things tonight, but I thought our penalty kill gave us a strong belief. 5-on-3, a few other situations, we drew a penalty on our penalty kill, great goaltending. That was a real important thing, and then fewer home run chances for the opposition. We’re not perfect, but there were fewer, and I thought we committed more to checking than we have in the past.\n- Defensive Shutdown\n  \u003e We aggressively checked, and sometimes when you ask your team to check, they back off, and they’re just standing and taking it, but we aggressively checked. When we had to go up ice, we went up ice. When we had to do what we needed to do in the neutral zone, we did it. We were all playing the same system, for the most part, versus off on our own.\n  \u003e This is a brand new slate for us. Yeah, there are some tendencies (from last year) that showed up, which is a good sign, but I’d like to think we’re moving in the right direction, even the game in Washington, other than the comeback. We’re starting to do some things characteristic of last year, but this is this year’s group. We’ll still find our way and evolve as we go\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.738382323Z","tags":null},"/LA-Kings-Takeaways-from-the-teams-6-4-loss-to-Winnipeg":{"title":"LA Kings - Takeaways from the teams 6-4 loss to Winnipeg","content":"\n# LA Kings - Takeaways from the teams 6-4 loss to Winnipeg\n\n| Date       | Site               | Link                                                                                                                                                 |\n| ---------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-28 | [[Hockey Royalty]] | [LA Kings - Takeaways from the teams 6-4 loss to Winnipeg](https://hockeyroyalty.com/2022/10/28/takeaways-la-kings-4-jets-6-definition-of-insanity/) |\n| 2022-10-28 | [[Hockey Royalty]] | [[LA Kings - Takeaways from the teams 6-4 loss to Winnipeg]]                                                                                         |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Ryan Sikes]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Despite scoring three unanswered goals in the first period, the [LA Kings](https://hockeyroyalty.com/) dropped a frustrating game to the Winnipeg Jets, 6-4, on Thursday night.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n- [[Tobias Bjornfot]]\n- [[Jacob Moverare]]\n- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n- Puck Possession Period\n  \u003e 12% of our schedule is gone, and we still don’t know how we want to play. I would think the experiment of run and gun that we’re trying to play, like how much more evidence do we need that it doesn’t work. There are simple hockey principles, you don’t turn pucks over at the line, you get pucks in deep, you forecheck, short shifts. The penalties that we’re taking are unacceptable, so there’s a lot of game management situations that go into it, and unless the group decides as a whole, we’ll experiment for another ten games.\n \u003e Maybe we will become the run-and-gun team. I don’t like our chances, but if that’s how we want to play and that’s what we’re going to keep trying, we’re probably going to keep getting the same results. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n- Defensive Lapses Continue\n  \u003e The first one, stuff like that happens, and we were still going, we scored three goals, and then we proceeded to give up a shorthanded goal. That should not happen.\n  \u003e It’s just playing more responsible. -- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n- First Line in Flux\n  \u003e Gabe has been probably our best offensive player. There are some things going on with Kopi’s line that I’m not happy with, and I thought that that Gabe needed an opportunity there. \\[…] What we have right now isn’t working, so we’ll have to address it tomorrow. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.738382323Z","tags":null},"/LA-Kings-Three-takeaways-from-4-3-loss-against-VGK":{"title":"LA Kings - Three takeaways from 4-3 loss against VGK","content":"\n# LA Kings - Three takeaways from 4-3 loss against VGK\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-12 | [[Hockey Royalty]] | [LA Kings - Three takeaways from 4-3 loss against VGK](https://hockeyroyalty.com/2022/10/12/three-takeaways-from-la-kings-4-3-loss-against-vgk/)\n2022-10-12 | [[Hockey Royalty]] | [[LA Kings - Three takeaways from 4-3 loss against VGK]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Ryan Durham]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Jonathan Quick]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Arthur Kaliyev]]\n- [[Sean Durzi]]\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Sloppy play all around dooms the LA Kings as they drop the season opener to the Vegas Golden Knights, 4-3.\n\u003e \n\u003e Three takeaways from the game\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n1) [[Jonathan Quick]]\n2) The Kids are alright\n3) Lack of sharpness\n\n\n\u003e When you look at the night, the first goal against was just terrible game management, coming out of the penalty box and not being aware.

He’s adjusting to a new team. I think if you refer back to Phil Danault’s time early last year, it didn’t go easy. And I think we’re going to see more and more from Kevin.

It’s a pretty good opponent for us to have … to see if we can get it going in the right direction consistently.\n\u003e It’s been going in the right direction but inconsistently.\n\n\u003e I like to think we’re moving in the right direction. Even the game in Washington, other than the comeback. But we’re starting to do some things characteristic of last year. But this is this year’s group. We’ll still find our way and evolve as we go.\n\n\u003e I can’t say enough about the young man. \\[[[Gabe Vilardi]]]’s been outstanding since training camp. The fact that Arvy wasn’t able to go after warm-up was a bit of a surprise to us. Things got shuffled quickly. He went up there. He has the toolkit to be playing up there. And he’s got a lot of confidence on the power play right now.\n\u003e He’s checking well. Using his body, his size. I think as he leaves the rink every day, he’s really enjoying the game. And he’s earned it.\n\n\u003e It’s our identity. We should be hard to play against. We should be predictable, we should take care of each other and we should be tight defensively. That’s who we are. That’s pretty simple.\n\n### [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n\u003e I’m just taking it game by game. There’s certain games where I’m feeling better than others.\n\n\u003e Different players. But with Phil, his stick is unreal. It’s unbelievable down low how many plays he keeps alive. Mooresy is just a work horse. They’re both similar. I think that kind of fits my game as well because I think I have a good stick as well and I like to play down low. We kind of just feed off each other.\n\u003e I kind of let them down. I should have scored a few times there when I didn’t. But, yeah, it was good.\n\n### [[Phillip Danault]]\n\u003e It’s huge. You need that and it’s part of culture. He fit right in. It didn’t take two or three games. He just fit in right away. I think it shows how ready he is and how strong he is mentally. He’s ready for an opportunity, which he took tonight.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.738382323Z","tags":null},"/LA-Kings-at-Chicago-Blackhawks-projected-lineup-betting-preview":{"title":"LA

These are the hardest games. When there’s not a ton of rhythm. There’s a lot of penalties. You’re trying to get yourself in it. It’s the first game of the season, too. I think there’s a lot of kinks that I’m trying to get out and the team’s trying to get out.\n\n\u003e Hopefully never have to win one like that again.\n\n\u003e It was a little bit challenging. You want to start out with camp right away. I had a really good summer, and I was really looking forward to kind of building that into camp. Getting a little injured was a little bit of a setback and you kind of feel like you’re having to play catch-up. Luckily it was minor. The thing with the season is you try and build into it as much as you can. Try and play your best hockey at the end of it.\n\u003e \n\u003e It’s more so just taking your time with the process, realizing you’re not going to be perfect right away and try and get better every day.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e If we look at his preseason, he goes to San Jose and plays the first period basically and then he’s out for a week. Eight or night days. Doesn’t feel the puck. Comes back into it and it’s not an easy task. For me, goaltending’s a lot like pitching. It’s tough to find your Cy Young winner in April. You usually find him in September and October. And goaltending around the league is probably like that. It’s finding its way.\n\u003e \n\u003e We have to help our goaltenders as much as we can. We haven’t been as tight as we’ve been. We haven’t broken out as clean (from our end). The penalty parade puts a lot of pressure on them.\n\n\u003e Probably both teams were thinking the same thing. Get us a save and we’ll get you a goal. Obviously, that was the way the night was going. We did give up six. I’m not sure that we can pin them all on Cal Petersen.\n\u003e \n\u003e What’s important for him is he got a win. He’s got some confidence as far as winning goes. And the team got that but it’s pretty evident we have to clean some things up.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.738382323Z","tags":null},"/LA-Kings-hope-to-settle-in-after-penalties-and-mistakes-evident-vs-Vegas":{"title":"LA Kings hope to ‘settle in’ after penalties and mistakes evident vs Vegas","content":"\n# LA Kings hope to ‘settle in’ after penalties and mistakes evident vs Vegas\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-12 | [[The Athletic]] | [LA Kings hope to ‘settle in’ after penalties and mistakes evident vs Vegas](https://theathletic.com/3682833/2022/10/12/kings-golden-knights-season-opener/)\n2022-10-12 | [[The Athletic]] | [[LA Kings hope to ‘settle in’ after penalties and mistakes evident vs Vegas]]\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Eric Stephens]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n- [[Jonathan Quick]]\n- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n- [[Arthur Kaliyev]]\n- [[Sean Durzi]]\n- [[Trevor Moore]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Alex Iafallo]]\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n- [[Matt Roy]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Thoughtful by nature whenever a question comes his way before he gives an answer, Todd McLellan ruminated on the unique element that is managing a team on its opening night as he went into his fourth with the Kings and 15th as an NHL head coach.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e I used to get all wound up. I get excited about opening night. But I also understand that based on experience, there’s so many highs and lows. Teams can be too wound up and too excited to play. They can be under-aroused. Execution can be poor but intent good. You can just be flat-out red rotten. There’s so many variables that go into opening night that it’s hard to predict where it will go.\n\u003e That second game is kind of where it really begins to settle in. You can’t put too much (into the first game). You can’t get too high or too low after opening night, I guess, is what I’m saying. Just because it’s so random. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e He’s proven it for 15 years. It’s certainly something that we’ve talked (about) before. I’m sure we’re going to talk going forward. -- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\n\u003e Knowing where the puck is coming out of the penalty box on a line change. You got to be aware of that. Missing the net on that play.  \\[...] A set breakout that we work on all the time. You’ve got numerous options. So, that is all game management. That’s getting engaged and being ready to go. Their team did a better job of it than we did tonight. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e It wasn’t all bad. But there’s stuff that we can certainly correct and eliminate from our games that are going to make us sharper and win more games. -- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\n\u003e We’ve preached and preached about it. Sometimes you got to get hit pretty hard with a two-by-four. Maybe this was it. You look at some of the penalties we’ve taken throughout exhibition season. I think I’ve mentioned it a few times. Penalized more away from our net than we were near our net. And what I mean by that is neutral zone and offensive zone.\n\u003e \n\u003e Maybe it’s not important yet, I don’t know. But it’ll cost you eventually and it did tonight.  -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e We’ll correct that for sure.\n\u003e You can chalk it up to a first game and all of that. “But the bottom line is we just can’t afford to lose a game like that. Especially with the amount of mistakes that we made.  -- [[Anze Kopitar]]","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.738382323Z","tags":null},"/LA-Kings-on-YouTube":{"title":"LA Kings on YouTube","content":"\n# LA Kings on YouTube\n\n| URL          | Feed     | Twitter                                |\n| ------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------- |\n| [LA Kings on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/lakings) | [Feed]() | [@twitterHandle](https://twitter.com/) | \n\n\n## Articles\n| Title | Source Link | Date Published |\n| ----- | ----------- | -------------- |\n|       |             |                |\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.738382323Z","tags":null},"/LA-Kings-powerplay-breakdown-versus-Nashville":{"title":"LA Kings powerplay breakdown versus Nashville","content":"\n# LA Kings powerplay breakdown versus Nashville\n\n| Date     | Site | Link                                   |\n| -------- | ---- | -------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-19 | [[Hockey Royalty]]      | [LA Kings powerplay breakdown versus Nashville](https://hockeyroyalty.com/2022/10/19/la-kings-powerplay-breakdown-versus-nashville/) |\n| 2022-10-19 | [[Hockey Royalty]] | [[LA Kings powerplay breakdown versus Nashville]] |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Joe Patarino]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings‘ powerplay – like many teams’ powerplay – is often a topic of conversation about what is going wrong.

There’s a group – a lot of them aren’t here anymore – there’s still a few that aren’t quite going to get it done. And that’s just the way it is. Not everybody can play.\n\u003e Our big concern is that middle group and what are they going to do and when are they going to do it. We’ve got three or four days left here before we’ve got to play that team again. Obviously both clubs are going to get better. They’re going to put different players in the lineup. We’ve given up 10 goals in the last six periods we’ve played. That’s not who we are and that’s not how we should be playing.\n\u003e I know they’re better than that. And that’s why we’re waiting for them. They’ve got to make these decisions now instead of seven, eight, 10 games into the season and they realize it’s a little bit too late. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n- [[Brandt Clarke]] is making it difficult for the Kings to send him back to the OHL.\n\n\u003e When I came in, my intentions were to stick around as long as possible, to kind of open a couple people’s eyes on my play and my style. And I think that’s what I’ve been doing. I’m really happy with how I’ve been playing. I’m really happy with the atmosphere around here. Everyone is so welcoming and I’m really happy to be here. I want to stay as long as I can. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n- [[Sean Durzi]] made his preseason debut at the last preseason game after completing his return from off-seasons shoulder surgery. \n\n\u003e I thought he did some good things on one side of the puck and others that he has to sharpen up. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e It’s kind of back to the drawing board. Make my reads quicker. Watch the tape and learn. Quite honestly, it’s three periods left in the preseason. Go in tomorrow, regrouping. Looking at what I can do better, which is a lot. I think there’s a lot more I can do and a lot I can fix in my game, quite honestly. It’s going back, learning from it and quite honestly just executing.\n\u003e You want to do it right away. Season’s coming up and I think I’m capable. Obviously, that’s what I’m going to do. -- [[Sean Durzi]]\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.738382323Z","tags":null},"/LA-Kings-vs-Florida-Panthers-How-to-Watch":{"title":"LA Kings vs Florida

We’re supposed to be more offensive, but we need to get back and play better defense. It’s easy to balance the two (the offensive push and defensive responsibility) out. Don’t take high risks, make the right play at the right time when you can jump into the offense you do it, but you just can’t create offense from nothing. If you (the defensemen) do things the right way, the points will come your way.\n\n\u003e It’s not all on the defense, I’ll tell you that much. We need more support, we want to be more aggressive on the forecheck with the defense and in turn, the forwards have to support us. They do 80 percent of the time, but the other 20 percent is catching us right now. We were watching clips of the Pittsburgh game (a 7-1 rout by the Penguins) and the decisions we’re making offensively are affecting us defensively. That game got out of hand so maybe that why it was happening, but it was happening way too often. We were losing guys, 3-on-2 against, breakaways, 2-on-1’s. If we want to be more aggressive, we need more coverage and be smarter with our aggression.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.738382323Z","tags":null},"/Last-Word-On-Sports":{"title":"Last Word On Sports","content":"\n# Last Word On Sports\n\n| URL          | Feed     | Twitter                                |\n| ------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------- |\n| [Homepage]() | [Feed]() | [@twitterHandle](https://twitter.com/) | \n\n\n## Articles\n| Title | Source Link | Date Published |\n| ----- | ----------- | -------------- |\n|       |             |                |\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.738382323Z","tags":null},"/LeBrun-Kings-president-Luc-Robitaille-on-growing-hockey-in-LA-and-his-teams-next-step":{"title":"LeBrun - Kings president Luc Robitaille on growing hockey in LA and his teams next step","content":"\n# LeBrun - Kings president Luc Robitaille on growing hockey in LA and his teams next step\n\n| Date       | Site             | Link                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| ---------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-24 | [[The Athletic]] | [LeBrun - Kings president Luc Robitaille on growing hockey in LA and his teams next step](https://theathletic.com/3718614/2022/10/24/los-angeles-kings-luc-robitaille/) |\n| 2022-10-24 | [[The Athletic]] | [[LeBrun - Kings president Luc Robitaille on growing hockey in LA and his teams next step]]                                                                             |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Pierre LeBrun]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e As I arrived for our interview last week at his Manhattan hotel, Luc Robitaille was wrapping up a business meeting.\n\u003e Every minute counts. There was no breather between that meeting and our interview. That’s how Robitaille rolls, jamming his days as he balances the business side of running the Kings with his hockey operations duties.\n\n\n## Players\n- \n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Luc Robitaille]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Luc Robitaille]]\n\u003e Whenever we come to the East Coast, we make sure we go to the league’s office, just to make sure we have a relationship there\n\n\u003e I don’t think there’s a more competitive sports market,” Robitaille said. “But we look at it like: We have our core fans, (and) we know when we have success, we’ll grow the brand.\n\u003e \n\u003e But that being said, we’ve got to be successful. We know that. When we go through something like a rebuild — and we kind of had the same strategy in a way in 2007 when Dean (Lombardi) came, (and) I remember at the time we figured, ‘Let’s just really communicate with our core fans. Let’s make sure they understand what we’re doing. And then when we’re successful, they’ll tell everyone else.’\n\u003e\n\u003e It’s definitely a tough market, but I don’t believe we compete with the other teams. I think we compete for our fans, and when we have success, they’re riding along with us.\n\n\u003e Definitely if you would have said we’re going to be missing [[Drew Doughty]] for this amount of games and, at some point in January, the six defensemen we had in our opening night lineup weren’t playing, and then we still got into the playoffs … I would have said there’s no way that was going to happen.\n\u003e\n\u003e So, we’re real happy with where we’re at. We’re exactly where we set out to be. We know this year we’re going to compete for the playoffs again. And the goal is to get the team to a place where, listen, it’s always hard to make the playoffs, but there’s a few teams in this league that you know when you start the season if they play to their level they’re going to be in. And then they’re trying to get to the next level of winning.\n\u003e \n\u003e We’re not quite there yet. We think we’ll be there in a couple of years. But that being said, we’re competing for it now, and once you get into the tournament, it’s anybody’s game.\n\n\u003e It’s definitely Blakey’s low-key approach. It’s just the way he is. He’s very low-key. He just wants to go about his job. We all respect that. He’s not going to change ever.\n\u003e \n\u003e There’s a few guys, it’s kind of funny, I always put Joe Sakic, Stevie Yzerman, they’re in that bucket with Blakey. They’re quiet, they go about their job, they work extremely hard, they’re very strategic. They don’t panic. They seem to have the same low-key approach where they’re steady. So we feel pretty fortunate to have Blakey on board.\n\n\u003e I try to split my days now, I spend time with Blakey and we’ll spend time with hockey ops in the morning. And then as the day keeps going, I’ll have all my business meetings scheduled and so forth. So it’s a little bit of a split in the day. And we stay in contact (with Blake). So that’s what has changed probably the most. I spend more time listening and being part of the direction we’re going as an organization on the hockey ops side.\n\n\u003e I love the game. I was lucky enough to play with Wayne Gretzky, whose passion for the game is, I mean, he would always talk about how it’s the greatest game and so forth. I always loved the saying.\n\u003e \n\u003e I always look at it like, what can we do to grow the game? To make it better and so forth. I think we’ve taken some major steps.\n\n\u003e The deal with ESPN was big. Because when you’re a young person who works in a bar in the U.S. and you come in for your shift at 4 p.m., the first thing you do is turn on the TVs, and you turn on ESPN no matter what.\n\n\u003e TNT is the first show in the U.S., hockey-wise, where you can’t wait to see what’s going to happen between periods. It’s like I can’t wait to see what they’ll see next between periods. It’s a good thing. It’s entertainment.\n\n\u003e A lot more kids are going to D-1, getting drafted.\n\n\u003e We followed up with the little Kings program, and it’s been tremendous growth on that. The Ducks started buying or making sure rinks weren’t closing. During the last three years during COVID, I think we’ve acquired six rinks or so. It’s really helping the growth of hockey.\n\u003e \n\u003e We’re seeing more and more players. If we could build five more rinks, we’d fill them up right now. It’s a great problem to have.\n\n\u003e Like a USHL or junior league coming out to the West Coast. We’re going to be behind it. It’s the next step that could be really good. We’d really like to get that done. That’s a big push.\n\n### [[Rob Blake]]\n\u003e Our relationship had been formed when we played together and has continued that way in our (front office) positions now. We share a similar vision on how the team plays and how the organization operates. He is very passionate about the game of hockey and what it means to play for the L.A. Kings.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.738382323Z","tags":null},"/Legacy-of-2007-class-not-lost-on-Simmonds-Clarke-sits-but-has-done-a-really-good-job-of-adapting-to-the-NHL":{"title":"Legacy of 2007 class not lost on Simmonds - Clarke sits but has “done a really good job of adapting to the NHL”","content":"\n# Legacy of 2007 class not lost on Simmonds - Clarke sits but has “done a really good job of adapting to the NHL”\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-29 | [[The Forum Report]] | [Legacy of 2007 class not lost on Simmonds - Clarke sits but has “done a really good job of adapting to the NHL”](https://theforumreport.com/legacy-of-2007-class-not-lost-on-simmonds-clarke-sits-but-has-done-a-really-good-job-of-adapting-to-the-nhl/) |\n| 2022-10-29 | [[The Forum Report]] | [[Legacy of 2007 class not lost on Simmonds - Clarke sits but has “done a really good job of adapting to the NHL”]]                                                                                                                                        |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jon Rosen]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Wayne Simmonds has always been so much more than his 240 games over three seasons in a Kings jersey.\n\n\n## Players\n- Wayne Simmonds\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n- [[Rasmus Kupari]]\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n- [[Sean Walker]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\u003e He was definitely a big part of this team growing up. Unfortunately we had to trade him away, but I guess getting traded for Mike Richards back then, it was a complement to him, too. But it was tough to see him go.\n\n### Wayne Simmonds\n\u003e After the first round \\[in 2007], Marty was a fourth rounder, like Dwight King. We had a lot of good players come out of the draft, and I think it set the foundation for what the Kings were able to do\n\n\u003e Doughts, he’s my daughter’s godfather. I talk to Quickie every once and a while, talk to Kopi. Had a few words for Brownie last year after his retirement. It’s always great to catch up with those guys.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e Up in the air, as far as I know. 4 o’clock games are a real strange time for us, and I haven’t gotten an update after the game on \\[[[Quinton Byfield]]].\n\n\u003e I thought \\[[[Rasmus Kupari]]] played quite well throughout training camp. He brings an element of speed and tenacity. We’d like him to have some offensive pop as well, but his job is to check and he does a really good job of that. Another penalty killer, a right-handed faceoff guy, a lot of reasons to have him, so he did a good job.\n\n\u003e Last year we went into their building and checked pretty well and came up with a win, and we tried to run and gun with them here and came up with a big loss. \\[...] targeted three areas that we thought we needed to take care of, that was it, and for the most part the guys got it done. That’s a good sign.\n\n\u003e Hockey decision more than anything. We’re going to get to the 9, 10, 11, 12-game mark, and our job as the coaches here, we’ll share our opinion with the management team. But to this point, \\[[[Brandt Clarke]]]’s done a really good job of adapting to the NHL.\n\n\u003e \\[[[Sean Walker]]]’s worked hard in practice. We’ve got to keep in mind his injury. Nobody talks about that and what he went through. It’s tough to come back from that. There are still repercussions to that as far as fatigue goes and how you feel, so sometimes he’s going to need the odd day off. I talked to Blakey a lot about that, because he went through it, and he talked about the first four or five months of the season, sometimes you’re really sore. It’s not the injury itself, it’s everything around the injury that can be fatigued.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.738382323Z","tags":null},"/Lias-Andersson":{"title":"Lias Andersson","content":"\n# Lias Andersson\n\nNHL.com | Twitter\n-|-\n[Lias Andersson]() | [@twitter_handle](https://twitter.com/)\n\nPlayer | \\# | Position | Shoots | Height | Weight | Born | Birthplace | Draft \n-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-\nLias Andersson | 17 | C | L | 6' 1\" | 183 | 1998-10-13 | Smogen, SWE | 2017 NYR, 1st rd, 7th pk (7th overall)\n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\nDate | Site |  Title\n---|---|---\n2022-10-06 | [[Mayors Manor]] | [[Projected Lineup - Kings vs Golden Knights at Frozen Fury, aka Preseason Game 6]]\n2022-09-27 | [[LA Kings Insider]] |  [[Day 6 Primer + The Differences Between Playing Center and Playing Winger]]\n2022-09-26 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[9-26 Preview – Projected Lineup + Back-To-Back Thoughts, JADs Focus, Spence, Moverare debuts]]\n\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\n| Date       | Site                 | Title                                                                                               |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-11-06 | [[Mayors Manor]]        | [[Reign Recap - Ontario Drops Game 2, Settle for a Split in Colorado]]                              |\n| 2022-11-05 | [[LA Kings Insider]]    | [[REIGN PREVIEW – Ontario at Colorado, 11-5 - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                      |\n| 2022-11-04 | [[Hockey Royalty]]   | [[Ontario Reign - Three takeaways from 2-0 win against Colorado]]                                   |\n| 2022-11-04 | [[Mayors Manor]]     | [[Reign Recap - Villalta Stands Tall in Colorado, Earns 2-0 Shutout]]                               |\n| 2022-11-04 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[Jordan Spence continuing to develop as a top prospect with the Ontario Reign - LA Kings Insider]] |\n| 2022-11-03 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[REIGN FINAL – Reign 2, Eagles 0 – Sturm, Villalta, Andersson - LA Kings Insider]]                 |\n| 2022-10-19 | [[Mayors Manor]]     | [[LA Kings Weekly Reign Report, October 16, 2022]]                                                  |\n| 2022-10-19 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[High scoring forwards have Ontario Reign off to hot start - LA Kings Insider]]                    |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[REIGN PREVIEW – Ontario vs Bakersfield, 10-16 - LA Kings Insider]]                                |\n| 2022-10-14 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[REIGN FINAL – Reign 8, Canucks 2 – Sturm, Tynan, Grans - LA Kings Insider]]       |\n\n\n## Post-Draft Coverage\nDate | Site |  Title\n---|---|---\n\n\n\n## Pre-Draft Coverage\nDate | Site |  Title\n---|---|---\n\n\n## Unprocessed Coverage\n- \n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.738382323Z","tags":null},"/Look-for-the-LA-Kings-to-take-a-cautious-approach-in-free-agency":{"title":"Look for the LA Kings to take a cautious approach in free agency","content":"\n# Look for the LA Kings to take a cautious approach in free agency\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n 2022-07-09 | [[Hockey Royalty]] | [Look for the LA Kings to take a cautious approach in free agency](https://hockeyroyalty.com/2022/07/09/look-for-the-la-kings-to-take-a-cautious-approach-in-free-agency/)\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Luke Platt]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Carl Grundstrom]]\n- [[Sean Durzi]]\n- [[Mikey Anderson]]\n- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n- [[Sean Walker]]\n\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings have already made one big splash this off-season when they acquired Kevin Fiala from the Minnesota Wild.

Maybe we will become the run and gun team. I don’t like our chances, but if that’s how we’re going to play and that’s what we’re going to keep trying, we’re probably going to keep getting the same results.\n\u003e How much more evidence do we need that that doesn’t work?\n\n\u003e We’re on the power play, and our only thought process on the power play is offense. And there’s time when there’s risk involved in it. But we don’t play risk at all. We just assume everything’s going to work out fine and it comes back the other way. Three times in two power plays. So, you’re in a situation where you have a really good period, you should be up and close to putting a team away early in the game, and they’re right back in it. But you want to run and gun, you don’t understand risk, you don’t play risk, and you’re not responsible for risk, and that’s what happens.\n\n\u003e There are things going on with Kopi’s line that I’m not happy with, and I thought that Gabe needed an opportunity there.\n\n\u003e What we have right now isn’t working, so we’ll have to address it tomorrow,\n\n\u003e Hey, we could use a better coaching staff, we could use forwards that committed, we needed D that moved the puck and we needed goaltending. There wasn’t one area. I told the guys between the second and third we all own a piece of this, so dig yourselves out, and we didn’t do it.\n\n### Brendon Dillon on Todd McLellan\n\u003e He demands structure, he demands discipline. Through their neutral zone, they’re a good team, they turn pucks over, too. It was more of a special teams battle, it seemed – lots of power plays, PKs. They’re a good team, they’re going to be right there at the end of the year. It’s early on here.\n\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eA big challenge integrating Kovalchuk was that he was so improvisational and Kopitar relies on predictable wingers and preferred Iafallo in his spot. Likewise, Fiala has freewheeled some, which doesn’t mesh with his center. That zig-zag near-offside reminded me of 17 next to 11.\u003c/p\u003e\u0026mdash; Jon Rosen (@jonnyrosen) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/jonnyrosen/status/1585865554648186881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eOctober 28, 2022\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.742382442Z","tags":null},"/Luc-Robitaille":{"title":"Luc Robitaille","content":"\n# Luc Robitaille\n\nNHL.com | Twitter\n-|-\n[Luc Robitaille]() | [@twitter_handle](https://twitter.com/)\n\nTitle | Organization \n--- | ---\nPresident, Alternate Governor | LA Kings\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\nDate | Title\n---|---\n\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\nDate | Title\n---|---\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.742382442Z","tags":null},"/Luke-Platt":{"title":"Luke Platt","content":"\n# Luke Platt\n\n| NHL.com | Twitter |\n| ------- | ------- |\n| [Luke Platt]() | [@twitter_handle](https://twitter.com/)\n\n| Title | Organization |\n| ----- | ------------ |\n|       |              |\n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date | Title |\n| ---- | ----- |\n|      |       |\n\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\n| Date | Title |\n| ---- | ----- |\n|      |       |\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.742382442Z","tags":null},"/Manon-Rheaume-first-woman-to-play-NHL-period-starts-anew-with-Kings-Los-Angeles-Times":{"title":"Manon Rheaume, first woman to play NHL period, starts anew with Kings - Los Angeles Times","content":"\n# Manon Rheaume, first woman to play NHL period, starts anew with Kings - Los Angeles Times\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-05 | [[LA Times]] | [Manon Rheaume, first woman to play NHL period, starts anew with Kings - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-10-05/column-nhl-woman-goalie-manon-rheaume)\n2022-10-05 | [[LA Times]] | [[Manon Rheaume, first woman to play NHL period, starts anew with Kings - Los Angeles Times]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Helene Elliott]]\n\n\n## Players\n- \n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Manon Rheaume]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Playing goal was as natural to Manon Rheaume as breathing.\n\u003e \\[...]\n\u003e She also didn’t intend to make history, but she couldn’t say no when the expansion Tampa Bay Lightning invited her to their training camp after she had helped Canada win gold at the 1992 women’s world championships.\n\u003e \\[...]\n\u003e Thirty years later, she has made it to the NHL. Not in uniform but as a member of the Kings’ player development department, one of many accomplished women who have been hired for meaningful roles on NHL teams the past few years. \n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e I personally find, same with Blake Bolden, that these girls are overachievers. They work really hard, and when you get them in your organization, they bring that attitude. It’s amazing to see. To me, I think there’s huge value.\n\u003e Manon, with her background and how much work she had to do and fighting against adversity to get to the level she got, there’s certainly a lot that could be taught to those young players. -- [[Luc Robitaille]]\n\n\u003e It’s really meeting our draft picks and getting to know them and see if I can see or feel something about those players. More like as a mom. Having two kids that play, I know when things go wrong, they call me. I don’t know if it’s easier to talk with me than their dad. I feel like I’m bringing that side of it.  -- [[Manon Rheaume]]\n\n\u003e All those women that played at a high level, even if they don’t make it to the NHL, they’re able to contribute to an NHL team in a different way with their ideas and their knowledge of the game. -- [[Manon Rheaume]]\n\n\u003e You can ask me, could I have played in the NHL way back then? Doing a training camp is one thing. Doing a full year, facing those shots, I was bruised all over after a week. Physically, I didn’t have the same strength as a man possessed.\n\u003e \n\u003e But I cannot say that a woman could never play there, because you never know. You could have a woman that’s super strong, super fast, or a female goaltender that is big and very agile and can play at that level. Nobody thought I would be able to do it in camp, so that’s why I would never say no. -- [[Manon Rheaume]]\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.742382442Z","tags":null},"/Marco-Sturm":{"title":"Marco Sturm","content":"\n# Marco Sturm\n\n| NHL.com | Twitter |\n| ------- | ------- |\n| [Marco

pre\n-season that you try to do it's obviously\nuh not the same Personnel but what are\nsome of the things you're trying to do\nand evaluate here\n\u003e A: I mean uh you know\nyou know who uh uh a game like this some\nguys never even played a game yet\num you know you want to try to get your\nlegs going and try to try to do the\nstuff we've worked on all week and uh\nand and try to yeah the best play you\ncan be you know there's a I think that\nthere's a lot of guys\num who could show me and uh and uh the\ncoaching staff what they can do what\nthey can bring for the team and uh and\nuh yeah that's what's nice and\neverything's all about \n\n\u003e Q: opportunities for\na lot of different players who might not\nbe on the power play all the time to get\nmore than one opportunity out there\ntonight what did you see from the power\nplay and what did you like what did you\nnot like\n\u003e A: well um I think we got scored on twice\non our power play and we got two or\nthree goals against on the BK so so that\nhas to be\nthat's that you know that has to be uh\nyeah\nfixed and uh you know but a lot of\ndifferent guys in a lot of different\npositions today so\num but again I think there is some areas\ntoday we we have to work on it I think\nthere's some guys in uh in this Locker\nwho will be here who have to be better\ntoo there is no\nyou know season starts in a week so you\nknow there's a short turnaround and uh\nyeah I think the guys\nbeen going gard really\nfor all week long they deserve to have a\nday off tomorrow and then regroup and\ntry to be better on Monday\n\n\u003e Q: some of those things that you said need\nto be fixed you know you have a\nbasically a week until uh opening night\nare those things that need to be fixed\nare they are they quick fixes are they\nthings that take time \n\u003e A: yeah there's a few\nthings I think it's in our control and\nuh\nand I think uh the mistakes we made\nespecially the first 40 45 minutes it\nwas\neverything on on our tape and you know\nso we gotta keep things simple first I\nthink everyone has to know also their\nrole and their team and uh you know you\ndon't have to do anything special you\njust gotta\ngotta play hard you got to play for the\nteam and be a good teammate and uh and\nuh yeah win some hockey games \n\n\u003e Q: there's a\nlot of leaders in the room and you know\ntonight there's a couple of times where\nyou know there's things that get a\nlittle bit out of hand but you guys have\n[[Cameron Gaunce]] [[Jacob Doty]] I mean what's it\nlike to kind of have those guys that\nhave been around and know how to handle\nthemselves \n\u003e A: yeah I mean\nwe don't worry about that I know we're\nwe have a lot of toughness on our team\nbut again I'm not looking at I'm looking\nmore to I want to play hockey\num yes this is a big part of our our\nteam too and our game but end of the day\num you know I just didn't like the way\nwe played\num in general I think we had a good\nstart the first 10 minutes and after\nthat uh San Diego was just better than\nus and and also I still I still think\nthere's\nwe still had enough good players in our\nlineup and but again\nit was a good lesson for all of us and\nuh and now we just have to make sure\nit's not gonna happen again \n\n\u003e Q: you\nmentioned a day off tomorrow what does\nthe the week look like as far as getting\nready for an opening game on on Friday\nnight \n\u003e A: yeah no so I will see the day of\ntomorrow we're gonna go come back\num\nI think a few guys will will go down\nafter you know I think we're gonna have\na few guys from the Kings as well so the\nteam definitely will look different on\nMonday\nbut again we only have I think three\npractices next week until game one so we\njust gotta make sure\nwe focus and be doing the right things in\nthose three days and be the best we can\nin game one \n\u003e we look forward to talking\nto you then

some excellent practices this\nweek I thought the guy's been really\nreally good uh I think we we are getting\nbetter every day\num yes we worked on a lot of things this\nweek uh system wise the way we want to\nplay and uh you know it was a lot of\ninformation for the guys uh but you know\nwhat they're doing really good so I'm\nreally pleased with uh with the effort\nso far \n\n\u003e Q: talked

you know but also these guys will\nhelp us on our team and uh no but you\nknow end of the day Talent alone it's\nnot going to win your hockey games and\nuh I think and that's something we we\nhave to get better\num and that's where we're working on it\nalready\nnot \\[just] being good with the puck\nespecially without the part 2 and yeah\nthat's an error we want to go around we\nwant to improve for sure \n\n\u003e Q: what do you\nthink in a week like this you you just\nhave one preseason game what are some of\nthe keys that you as a staff try to to\nget the guys to you know pay attention\nto what are some of the things that you\nhighlight to them that are important on\na week like this \n\u003e A: no I mean every day is\na different theme\num you know epidem is a different system\nso the good thing is a lot of them\nalready had a chance to play uh\nexhibition game over two or three with\nthe with the Kings so that helps\num during our week we try to even today\neven if it's just a little scrimmage you\nknow just for a few minutes so try to to\nget a game ready we do have uh only one\nuh preseason game so it's not not as\neasy but you know we as a coaching staff\nwe try to do our best to get these guys\nready and so they don't really have to\nthink when when it's game time so I\nthink we're we're in uh good shape now\nand yeah hopefully for good results\nthen on Saturday \n\n\u003e Q: for you guys as a\nstaff is it exciting this week I mean\nwhat is it like kind of coming into this\nweek and being able to you were helping\nout you're obviously on the ice during\nthe King's camp so you it's not the\nfirst time on the ice with these guys\nbut to kind of have your meetings and\nyour plan and kind of go and have\npractice run your way\n\u003e A: for me it's great because uh get to know\nthe guys uh yes I was not far away but\nyou know I never really worked on a\ndaily basis with these guys so it's been\nreally really helpful for me to be\naround not just the coaching staff the\nplayers to get to know and  know their\nstrength and weakness wickedness so so\nit's good no it's uh it's exciting was a\nreally exciting week for me and I think\nfor everyone else

[[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings failed to take advantage of a more defensively sound performance than in their opener and were unable to capitalize on added rush opportunities, falling 4-1 to the Seattle Kraken before leaving on a five-game road trip that begins Saturday at Minnesota.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e We played much better defensively than in Game 1. We kept a heavy, hard team to 16 shots on goal, even strength. Our penalty kill did a really good job in a lot of situations,” he said. “I know we gave up a goal, but the 5-on-3 was really positive. So there are some things that we have to take from that game and look at it positively. The negative side, we’re a minute and a half in and we have a too many men on the ice penalty. Game management. Three O-zone penalties tonight. Game management. Three O-zone penalties. Game management. It’s something we’ve been harping and harping on and those are essentially impossible situations to practice, so they’ve got to take care of it.  -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e He’s a really nice guy and pretty goofy, to be honest. He liked to keep it light and then he’s got a great shot and works hard out there and wins battles and is a pretty good guy to play with. I obviously haven’t played with him much because he was playing with Zegras at world juniors. But he was a lot of fun to be around as a teammate and he meshed with everyone.\n\u003e He never took anything super serious when he didn’t need to. Obviously when the game started he dialed it in, but that was kind of it – we were practicing, if we’d have a big game the next day, in the morning skate, he was keeping it light. -- Matty Beniers on [[Arthur Kaliyev]]\n\n\u003e We dressed six defensemen tonight. I know he wasn’t six. I’m pretty sure he wasn’t five, and I don’t believe he was four either, so that’s what I thought of him. I thought he had a real good night, didn’t hurt us at all defensively, creative offensively. I’d like to see him shoot the puck a little bit because I think he’s got a great shot and loves to pass, but he had some really good looks at the net where he could’ve shot the puck.  -- [[Todd McLellan]] on [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e They’re a scrappy team, they get in the way a lot. Heavy, hard sticks. A lot of battles, a lot of crap coming out of the battles. There’s rarely anything clean when you play against them, so when you do have the opportunity – I thought we created more in the game, believe it or not, than what showed up on the scoreboard, and the simple fact is we didn’t want to shoot the puck. We wanted to be way more over-creative, and I think of two on ones, I think of three-on-ones, I think we almost had a four-on-one, we didn’t get any shots off. Just too cute. When we’re playing well – I thought you could kind of feel it in the third – we started to put some pressure on, we shot the puck, we got it back, get ‘em out of position, but a little too cute right now. Still trying to figure out who we are.  -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.742382442Z","tags":null},"/McLellan-addresses-Petersens-start-Weve-got-to-get-him-going-Hes-got-to-play-like-he-can-play":{"title":"McLellan addresses Petersens start - “Weve got to get him going Hes got to play like he can play”","content":"\n# McLellan addresses Petersens start - “Weve got to get him going Hes got to play like he can play”\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 2022-10-20 | [[The Forum Report]] | [McLellan addresses Petersens start - “Weve got to get him going Hes got to play like he can play”](https://theforumreport.com/mclellan-addresses-petersens-start-weve-got-to-get-him-going-hes-got-to-play-like-he-can-play/) |\n| 2022-10-20 | [[The Forum Report]] | [[McLellan addresses Petersens start - “Weve got to get him going Hes got to play like he can play”]]                                                                                                                          |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jon Rosen]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Skilled at handling momentum through the first three games of the road trip, the LA Kings fell behind the weight of a 3-0 first period deficit and lost 6-1 to the Pittsburgh Penguins Thursday evening at PPG Paints Arena. That the Kings significantly out-chanced the Penguins up and down the ice in the first period was irrelevant. After 20 minutes their starting goalie had been pulled and their game plan adjusted to summon whatever offense could bring them back in the game.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Cal Petersen]]\n- [[Brendan Lemieux]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e Well when I look at the start we had, I thought we played the way we wanted to play. We played fast, we were aggressive, forced them into situations where they had to turn the puck over and things were going pretty well for us. Even after the first goal, I thought we responded well, but by the time it got to three, unfortunately it wasn’t the same way anymore. Obviously we’d like to have a couple of those back in the first period. Even if we’re coming out of it at one I think we’re in a much better state mentally. But with that being said, that’s the defensive side of it. I thought offensively we had some opportunities to put some pucks on our tape, cross-ice one-timers, plays in and around the net where we weren’t particularly sharp offensively as well, so we took it at both ends.\n\n\u003e I guess with Cal, there’s no secret. We’ve got to get him going. He’s got to play like he can play. He’s an NHL goaltender, he’s an outstanding young man that’s played extremely well at this level, and we’re trying – just like we would with forwards and defensemen – to get him to where he can be, and he has to be better.

Lost time is lost time, and it’s gone, and sometimes when you chase that make-up phase it becomes really tough.\n\n\u003e \\[[[Rasmus Kupari]]]’s a big man that skates extremely well, and his play without the puck is something we’re proud of. He does a really good job sorting things out, coming back to his end, he defends well. Long stick, very good penalty killer when he has to do those things. Quite often those first round draft picks are always relied on to score. ‘Is this guy going to score 35 or 40?’ We want him to score. But there are some things he does really well right now that if he keeps doing those things we’ll keep him available to us.”\n\u003e Give Ras credit, because he’s found a niche to get himself here, and hopefully that scoring does come later.\n\n### [[Drew Doughty]]\n\u003e It was good to see \\[Kyle Clifford and Jake Muzzin]. They came over for a little bit the night before the game, just chatted it up, had a couple beers. It was good to see them. Muzz, I always keep in contact with and see him in the summers. Cliffy, not as much, but I got to see both of them this summer and we’ll be friends for a long time.\n\n\u003e \\[Jake Muzzin]’s had to battle through a lot, and he plays the game hard, blocks a lot of shots, a lot of hits. It’s hard for a guy to play as long as he has playing the way he does. Credit to him – he’s such a big part of that team and I think you can really see the Leafs missing him right now, so hopefully he gets back and is able to play again, but health comes first, so that’s all we wish – that his health gets better.\n\n### [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n\u003e I don’t need much feedback. I know when I’m playing well and when I need to play better..\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.742382442Z","tags":null},"/NEWS-Updated-Information-on-Status-of-Byfield-and-Turcotte":{"title":"NEWS -

After a big acquisition, there's an instinct to wait for that person to do it. But that's not how the Kings achieved what they achieved.\n\n- 00:03:12 \n[[Gabe Vilardi]], [[Quinton Byfield]], and [[Alex Iafallo]] - How important will the line be?\nMore people should be talking about Vilardi. Mayor thinks he was the highest skill player in the prospect pool. He's now starting to show that.\n\n- 00:04:25 \nAcquiring [[Phillip Danault]] is insurance on [[Quinton Byfield]], letting him develop on his own pace. They need the kids to take a step forward. [[Arthur Kaliyev]] is on the fourth line instead of the third, which is a problem for his develop.\n\n- 00:06:10 \nIs the 0-2 start the team in front of [[Jonathan Quick]], or is it him? \nQuick stated that he wanted to play beyond this contract, which was surprising. [[Cal Petersen]] needs to step up and show more. The Kings need to start looking beyond Quick. If he's the playoff goaltender, Quick needs to be well rested. The Kings need balance and options in goal. More consistency needed from Petersen.\n\n- 00:08:30\n[[Brandt Clarke]]'s start refreshing? Does he stay past 9 games?\n\"I told you so.\" He's exciting to watch and has the, \"It\" factor. [[Drew Doughty]] asked [[Rob Blake]] if he was going to be kept around. Mayor thinks Clarke will be around all season, but the World Juniors is the wildcard. They might make him available for the tournament. The Kings roster is overloaded with right-handed d-men. [[Jim Hiller]] and [[Trent Yawney]] will take a big role in developing him.\n\n- 00:12:05 \nWhat about that surplus if right-shot D? Will they wait until the trade deadline? Or sooner?\nThey need to understand what they have. Is [[Sean Walker]] tradeable? Can he be packaged? What about [[Jordan Spence]], who belongs in the NHL? The roster needs a chance to play together and figure things out. The team has a treasure chest of prospects, which was the goal. Even with Brock Faber traded in the [[Kevin Fiala]] deal, the team is overloaded on RHD. They need to make sure that [[Alex Edler]] isn't playing \u003e20 minutes a night or \u003e65 games played.\n\n- 00:14:35\nDid the Kings overachieve last year?\nMayor doesn't think so.

Just go out there and let the body take over. Physically, I had about five minutes to roll out, stretch quickly. I skipped a little bit, and then it was ‘get ready.’ Definitely weird, but I think I handled it well and I’m happy with how the game turned out. -- [[Sean Walker]]\n\n\u003e I just wanted to make sure to score, and he made a great play. He backchecked hard and stripped me, and right when I shot it, he got his stick on it, so it was a good play by him. -- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n\n\u003e Everybody wanted to win it for Arvy. You can see a lot of guys going over and tapping him, saying, ‘hey, no problem, we’ve got this,’ and that’s how it ended. But we shouldn’t want to be doing that too often, putting ourselves in that situation. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e Obviously Edler didn’t play, and that’s never a good sign, so we’ll see how he is in the morning, and I don’t have an update for you yet on Iafallo. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e We know it was not acceptable the last couple games, so definitely it was a little better tonight. -- [[Phillip Danault]]\n\n\u003e This was the first game I felt like myself again, so it was a good step in the right direction, I think. -- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n\n\u003e Great play by him to get out of there quickly. There were four guys on the blue line, I think, so it was a great heads up play and a great pass by Mooresy. -- [[Phillip Danault]]\n\n\u003e Well, we yelled at Sean Walker to get his equipment on. No warm-up, and he played. That’s all you can do. The game plan doesn’t change because one guy goes down. Next man up, and that’s how it happened. And for me … that may be the best way for him to go in and play. No thinking, just go play the game. His ability to come back from the injury not having played for a long, long time, I thought tonight he did an admirable job under difficult circumstances, yet it may have favored him. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e It was five minutes into warm-ups. I was kind of just hanging out in the back. I heard Eds took a puck somewhere and just to be ready, so I started my warm-up there and that was kind of it, then. Just got ready and got out there. Not the usual routine and everything, but I think I handled it well. -- [[Sean Walker]]","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.742382442Z","tags":null},"/No-hands-tipped-on-Clarkes-status-as-competition-rises-so-do-Vilardi-and-his-new-linemates-numbers":{"title":"No hands tipped on Clarkes status - as competition rises, so do Vilardi and his new linemates numbers","content":"\n# No hands tipped on Clarkes status - as competition rises, so do Vilardi and his new linemates numbers\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-11-03 | [[The Forum Report]] | [No hands tipped on Clarkes status - as competition rises, so do Vilardi and his new linemates numbers](https://theforumreport.com/no-hands-tipped-on-clarkes-status-as-competition-rises-so-do-vilardi-and-his-new-linemates-numbers/) |\n| 2022-11-03 | [[The Forum Report]] | [[No hands tipped on Clarkes status - as competition rises, so do Vilardi and his new linemates numbers]]                                                                                                                               |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jon Rosen]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Forum Club. Yet another beautiful day in the City of Broad Shoulders. But last spring, few shoulders were broader than those of Jack Johnson. Eminently friendly and approachable, Johnson, who signed a one-year, $950,000 contract with Chicago this offseason, received that warmth back from a traveling Kings contingent eager to complement him on winning the 2022 Stanley Cup. Plenty of smiles surrounded the veteran defenseman who’ll appear in his 1,035th NHL game tonight.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Jonathan Quick]]\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n- [[Drew Doughty]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e They’re not afraid to score goals. I think that comes from their experience. I think Jonathan Toews is playing really, really well, and good for him. I’m happy for him. Obviously Kaner’s still a big part of it, but they’re proud players and they’re working hard, and when they do that, they’re very dangerous going the other way.\n\n\u003e I don’t know yet if we’re distributing the minutes the way we want to because we haven’t had a good run of consistent play night after night.\n\n\u003e \\[...] when the game’s on the line, we have to make decisions real quick, and the last thing we’re thinking about is whether we should have the right player out there because he’s played a minute over his prescribed time.

A pleasant game day to you from underneath the marine layer in El Segundo. This is still the marine layer, correct? With the recent thunderstorms and this summer’s humidity and mosquitoes I am concerned our beautiful Mediterranean climate is being overtaken by Florida and it’s not always easy to tell. This has little to do with tonight’s LA Kings – Seattle Kraken game (7:30 pm / Bally Sports West / ESPN+ / LA Kings Audio Network), which was preceded by an optional morning skate at TSPC.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e It’s going to be a big moment and it’s going to be really exciting, but after I get that first shift I think I’ll just settle in, do what I do, just play hockey again and it’s just another game, I think.  -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e I thought last year that that Seattle team had developed an identity at being pretty quick and then on top of you. I saw that again last night. They didn’t give you a lot of time and space to maneuver, to make long thinking plays. You’ve got to be connected and quick to play against them. They’ve got a big, heavy back end that defends well. Obviously, their power play was very good last night. They’ve added a significant chunk of offensive talent to their team. They’ll be a tough team to have not only for us, but for 30 other teams.  -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e It wasn’t planned that way.

Continued progress.”\n\u003e That was Rob Blake’s generalized answer to what he would see as growth from last season to this season.\n\u003e Throughout last season, [[Rob Blake|Blake]] maintained that word, progress. It was never, publicly at least, about setting a bar or a line for what the team needed to achieve, there wasn’t a mandate as to what progress was, but rather just a focus on the word. Progress.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e Progress. Continued progress. -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\u003e We’ve made a big step getting back in the playoffs and now you’ve got to hold that level and keep getting in. I think the roster starts to take a little more shape, you add a few pieces through free agency, give the young guys a couple more years to get up and running at the NHL level and now you put the emphasis on them producing and helping us. -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\u003e I would say it’s tougher going from once you become a playoff team to be able to become a real contender. Now you’re dealing with really, really good teams once you get in. We made a step last year, but now we have to make sure we have the ability to move past that and keep that going. I think Todd used the phrase ‘we’re not sneaking up on anybody’. Not anymore. I think our coaching staff will have our players prepared for that. -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\u003e Last year was a big step for this team and for some individuals and the team in general, but now we have to upgrade it again. Yeah, it was great to make the playoffs of course but making the playoffs is not the goal here. It’s doing some damage in the playoffs, but in order to do that, it’s getting there first and then roll from there. -- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\n\u003e You’re never the finished product on day one. I think I’ve mentioned to a few guys that day one is often too high or too low and day two is really where you start to see what the team is made of. We’re at day one, we’re going to make it important because it obviously is. We’d like to see our identity come out, we’d like to see our structure come out, we’d like to see individuals find their game within our game. There are areas that we’ve concentrated a little bit more on through training camp and we should see improvements in those areas, but it will take some time. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e There are a bunch of guys in here that have gone through a bunch of camps, so I think everybody’s looking to a day like today, where we’re working towards tomorrow. We are in a good spot and we’re in good spirits for the start of the season. -- [[Drew Doughty]]\n\n\u003e It’s getting there. I think there are less and less concerns throughout the lineup. I think there still are at different times and that there will be as the season goes on, but I do think we have players that can fill certain roles. We do have some depth in the right positions if needed, that was a major factor last year that I’m not sure we had set and understood well enough with major injuries Some of these guys were able to step in and play those minutes. -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\u003e Expectations, there’s a lot that goes with it and I think we have to define within our interior walls what we expect out of this group,” Blake said. “Building and getting better, every time we’re on the ice, we have to get better. We’ve got to get our special teams better, a lot of areas of our game need to increase from a year ago to keep that level. Those are the expectations and we’ve talked to the players and it’s from within. We’ve defined that on a personal level and on a team level, there are expectations that we want these guys to meet. -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.742382442Z","tags":null},"/Ontario-Reign":{"title":"Ontario Reign","content":"\n# Ontario Reign\n\nLA Kings affiliate in the [[AHL]].;;\n\n[[Kings Prospects on the Ontario Reign]]\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.742382442Z","tags":null},"/Ontario-Reign-Opening-Night-Lineup-vs-Abbotsford-Canucks":{"title":"Ontario Reign - Opening Night Lineup vs Abbotsford Canucks","content":"\n# Ontario Reign - Opening Night Lineup vs Abbotsford Canucks\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-14 | [[Mayors Manor]] | [Ontario Reign - Opening Night Lineup vs Abbotsford Canucks](https://mayorsmanor.com/2022/10/ontario-reign-opening-night-lineup-vs-abbotsford-canucks/)\n2022-10-14 | [[Mayors Manor]] | [[Ontario Reign - Opening Night Lineup vs Abbotsford Canucks]]\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Scott Coffman]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[T.J.

In stark contrast, this will be a new beginning for Kings prospect Andre Lee. Originally selected by LA at the 2019 NHL Draft, he’s yet to make his ‘official’ debut as a pro player – at least while being on a pro contract. After completing his third successful campaign with UMass-Lowell last season, he skated in 11 games for the Reign on a tryout contract. This year marks the first of his two-year Entry Level Contract and tonight will be Game 1 of that journey.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Andre Lee]]\n- [[Nate Thompson]]\n- [[Akil Thomas]]\n- [[Alex Turcotte]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.742382442Z","tags":null},"/Ontario-Reign-Projected-Lineup-vs-Bakersfield-Condors-on-Sunday":{"title":"Ontario Reign - Projected Lineup vs Bakersfield Condors on Sunday","content":"\n# Ontario Reign - Projected Lineup vs Bakersfield Condors on Sunday\n\n| Date       | Site             | Link                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| ---------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[Mayors Manor]] | [Ontario Reign - Projected Lineup vs Bakersfield Condors on Sunday](https://mayorsmanor.com/2022/10/ontario-reign-projected-lineup-vs-bakersfield-condors-on-sunday/) |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[Mayors Manor]] | [[Ontario Reign - Projected Lineup vs Bakersfield Condors on Sunday]]                                                                                                 |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Scott Coffman]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Tyler Madden]]\n- [[Martin Chromiak]]\n- [[Kim Nousiainen]]\n\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e For Game 2 of Ontario's 2022-23 season, it's Kings v.

This is his first professional head coaching job.\n- Before the Kings and [[Ontario Reign|Reign]] training camp, Sturm and his staff ran the [[2022 Rookie Camp]].\n\n\u003e We’ve had some excellent practices this week. I thought the guys have been really really good. I think we’re getting better every day and we’ve worked on a lot of things this week system wise, the way we want to play and it was a lot of information for the guys but they’re doing really good so I’m really pleased with the effort so far. -- [[Marco Sturm]]\n\n\u003e It’s been a really exciting week for me and I think everyone else in the locker room too. They all want to play. It’s been a long summer, it’s been a long camp including the Kings camp so I think everyone wants to play now. -- [[Marco Sturm]]\n\n\u003e I feel great. It’s a good feeling to be back after four months so I’m just enjoying every moment here and I can’t wait for the season to start. -- [[Martin Chromiak]]\n\n\u003e It was a great experience to play a preseason game,” said Chromiak.”I learned a lot from those older guys and NHL players so I just want to take a lot from them and from the coaches and do my best. -- [[Martin Chromiak]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.742382442Z","tags":null},"/Ontario-Reign-defense-takes-center-stage-in-teams-6-1-start-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"Ontario Reign defense takes center stage in teams 6-1 start - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# Ontario Reign defense takes center stage in teams 6-1 start - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 2022-11-02 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [Ontario Reign defense takes center stage in teams 6-1 start - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/11/02/ontario-reign-defense-takes-center-stage-in-teams-6-1-start/) |\n| 2022-11-02 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[Ontario Reign defense takes center stage in teams 6-1 start - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                                   |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jared Shafran]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e To start each of the last two seasons, the Ontario Reign have opened up with a total of seven games during the month of October. Both in 2021-22 and now in 2022-23, after closing out the month Saturday night with a 4-3 win over Bakersfield, the Reign earned wins in six of those seven contests. For the second straight campaign, Ontario sits in first place in the Pacific Division as the calendar flips to November.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Cameron Gaunce]]\n- [[Pheonix Copley]]\n- [[Jordan Spence]]\n- [[Tobias Bjornfot]]\n\n## Staff\n- [[Marco Sturm]]\n- [[Chris Hajt]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Marco Sturm]]\n\u003e Before the season I asked the guys, ‘What’s our identity?’ and slowly, I think we’re getting into finding that out. This was something I was looking forward to. I know we have a lot of skill, but we needed to be better without the puck. From day one we were working on it pretty hard and I think lately it just shows that we are able to do that and still win hockey games and it’s nice to see.\n\n\u003e Those guys have to be leaders and be at their best every night. At some point they should be up again. I’m very happy I have them but I also want to push them to not be here and be somewhere else and also be successful.\n\n\u003e We try to keep it a little bit similar, but I think every head coach is different so \\[[[Chris Hajt]]] probably sees a lot of different things than I do and what other coaches did in the past.\n\n\u003e We still have ways to go. There’s a lot of work to do but I think we are on the right track.\n\n### [[Cameron Gaunce]]\n\u003e I think there’s more buy-in because our coaching staff right from day one has put a very big emphasis on play without the puck. This is something that they established from our first day of training camp. We needed to be a team that is greatly improved in our play away from the puck in our own zone and in the neutral zone forechecking. And because of that, I think a lot of players have realized that’s got to be one of our identities, one of our calling cards.\n\n\u003e Our offense isn’t always going to be there. Whether it’s because we run into a hot goalie or our guys aren’t on their A-games, you can always lean back on being defensive-minded and having that work ethic. Our coaching staff has really emphasized that.\n\n\u003e I think to say that we haven’t leaned on them a bit too much right now would be naïve. They’ve both played exceptionally well and have given us more than a chance to win every night.\n\n\u003e \\[[[Pheonix Copley]]] is a pro 24/7. He’s not a guy who kind of goes in and out when he decides to work and when he doesn’t. You know that every day, whether it be practice or game, he’s putting his best foot forward. So, not only does that give him the best opportunity to succeed, but it just instills a confidence in everyone else on the team because we see the effort he puts in, we see the diligence he has, and with the skill and talent he has you balance that with the work ethic and it’s going to be a formula for winning.\n\n\u003e I think when you look at our d-corps, we’ve got eight, nine guys who can all play. Our first d-pairing is NHL caliber with Bjornfot and Spence, so we need to really utilize that because in the American Hockey League you never know how long that’s going to go on for. The flux in rosters is always kind of crazy so while we have this group, we need to really take advantage of it. We’ve got a lot of experience and it’s a mature group that really understands our role. We’ve got forwards who can do stuff with the puck that we as defensemen probably can’t. I think the defensemen on our team aren’t doing more than they have to, we’re just relying on our systems and what makes each one of our games special.\n\n### [[Chris Hajt]]\n\u003e Everyone was on the same page. Everyone had a job to do and they did it within the structure and played with some aggressiveness so good on them to get it done.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.742382442Z","tags":null},"/Ontario-Reign-on-Youtube":{"title":"Ontario Reign on Youtube","content":"\n# Ontario Reign on Youtube\n\nURL | Feed | Twitter\n-|-|-\n[Ontario Reign](https://www.youtube.com/c/OntarioReignAHL) | [Feed]() | [@twitterHandle](https://twitter.com/) \n\n\n## Articles\n| Title | Source Link | Date Published |\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.742382442Z","tags":null},"/Ontarios-Quinton-Byfield-makes-history-by-becoming-highest-drafted-Black-player-in-NHL-Draft":{"title":"Ontarios Quinton Byfield makes history by becoming highest-drafted Black player in NHL Draft","content":"\n# Ontarios Quinton Byfield makes history by becoming highest-drafted Black player in NHL Draft\n\n| Date     | Site | Link                                   |\n| -------- | ---- | -------------------------------------- |\n| 2020-10-07 | [[Global News]]     | [Ontarios Quinton Byfield makes history by becoming highest-drafted Black player in NHL Draft](https://globalnews.ca/news/7385038/quinton-byfield-nhl-draft/) |\n| 2020-10-07 | [[Global News]]     | [[Ontarios Quinton Byfield makes history by becoming highest-drafted Black player in NHL Draft]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[sean O'Shea]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e He has the respect of coaches, his town’s mayor, and a former NHL tough guy.\n\u003e Now, 18-year-old [[Quinton Byfield]] has something else: the distinction of becoming the highest-drafted Black player in the NHL Entry Draft.

I could already play regular-season games.\n\n\u003e It definitely took a little bit of the competitive edge out of the game and yeah, definitely the flow, you’re sitting down on the bench and you lose your legs. You saw guys start going out, twirling around, but you’re still not skating, you’re just twirling around. It’s not something you want to happen as a player.\n\n\u003e I think he’s a great player, he sees the ice very well, he makes very good plays, I can’t say enough about his offensive ability. He can learn a little bit on the other side of the puck, but who couldn’t when you come in as an offensive defenseman. I went through the same stuff, I had to learn how to play defense and we’ve got a lot of good guys on our team who can help teach him. I don’t want to say he’s NHL ready, but he’s basically NHL ready.\n\n### [[Matthew Villalta]]\n\u003e Yeah, that was the first one ever for me so very exciting. Bill let me know yesterday during practice that I’d be starting tonight, so obviously a very exciting opportunity to wear the Kings jersey down here in Ontario in front of all of our fans, it was very special. I just wanted to go in there and do the best job I could. As the game went on, it felt better and better and I feel like I adjusted to the pace and got my game speed back, which I wanted to do earlier off the scrimmages we had during camp. I think, all in all, we would have liked to get the win, especially in front of our fans here, but sometimes that’s the way it goes, it’s hockey. Other than that I thought it was a good day.\n\n\u003e 100%. We had a really good crowd tonight and I definitely heard them. Like I said yesterday, anytime you get to play here in the Inland Empire, it’s a treat to play in front of our fans and you want to go out there and try and give them the best show you can. It was very exciting and I think \\[the fans here] have a lot to be excited about this year.\n\n\u003e I think the biggest thing is just game intensity, especially for not playing all summer. Going into camp you try to ramp that up, maybe a few weeks before camp and obviously it takes a few scrimmages and practices to really get it back and feel comfortable. It’s a fun challenge definitely. When you get up here in the NHL preseason, there are a lot of skilled players, they’re elite, they make plays happen real quick, tape to tape passes and shooters are pretty accurate. It was a real good challenge and a lot of fun.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e I can’t remember three panes of glass in one game, but it’s good for us to come out here. We have good, loyal fans in this part of the country and they support our minor league team very well. Yeah, it wasn’t the best night in terms of ice conditions, or obviously the glass, the momentum of the game and the ability to evaluate it, but it still meant something for us to come here. It’s important that we did that.\n\n\u003eJust keep on playing him, he’s getting tested every night. Different elements, different factors, different teams. He played in Vegas the other night in a sold out building, coming here and trying to figure out all of the momentum stuff in a game, fatigue setting in a bit for him, so he’s getting tested. He’s earned a very valuable off day tomorrow and he’ll pick back up with the rest of the group tomorrow.\n\n\u003e It was nice to see number eight back out there. One, it’s great to see him back out there. He’s got enthusiasm, he’s excited to play so he was trying to find his game. It’s been a while since he’s played and that was tough night to do it. Even for us, we can’t really evaluate real well. We’ll look at where players were going, but the ice conditions were terrible and the ability to connect passes and stuff wasn’t very good and that’s Drew’s game. He got a sweat and he got to play around players get physical, which was great.\n\n\u003e It’s huge for both of them. We tried to split the night, knowing that Moore and Danault were playing, so we tried to split the night with [[Samuel Fagemo|Sammy Fagemo]] and [[Gabe Vilardi|Gabe]]. Was it fair to them, I don’t know, it’s a tough evaluator, I wish it was perfect conditions. They both played well.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.742382442Z","tags":null},"/PRESEASON-FINAL-Kings-2-Ducks-1-Walker-Vilardi-McLellan":{"title":"PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 2, Ducks 1 – Walker, Vilardi, McLellan","content":"\n# PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 2, Ducks 1 – Walker, Vilardi, McLellan\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-02 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 2, Ducks 1 – Walker, Vilardi, McLellan](http://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/02/preseason-final-kings-2-ducks-1-walker-vilardi-mclellan/)\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Sean Walker]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings earned their second victory of the preseason with a 2-1 victory over the Anaheim Ducks on Sunday evening at Crypto.com Arena.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### Gabe Vilardi\n\u003eYeah, I agree with that. I think similar to last year, we’ve got to start finding ways to score more goals, but definitely the chances were there. If you put up 40 shots, every game but only score two goals, some nights like tonight, maybe it’ll win games but other nights, teams are going to score more than two goals. Quickie played great, we’ve just got to find ways to score goals however that is.\n\n\u003e In all honesty, it’s not a lot of me out there, I’m in front of the net and I’m really just trying to create attention and try to find that that backdoor space. But yeah, they were moving around really fast and I’m in more of a recover the puck mode, just trying to create space for other guys by being almost like a distraction and bringing guys in. You kind of saw that on Juice’s goal today, I guess. We’ve been working on that and I actually really liked it, it looks good.\n\n\u003e We’ve got three lefties out there, I’m the only righty \\[among the forwards]. It’s hockey at the end of the day and you’ve got to read the play and gain possession before position, so you’ve got to have the puck before you can go into roles and spots. It helps having Kevin and Juice, who are very similar players I think in terms of half-wall capabilities and one timing the puck. It’s easy for them to switch.\n\n### Todd McLellan\n\u003e Yeah, I thought in phases of the game it did. Not so much early, second period yes and as the night went on, I thought you could see more of our game coming together, the pieces systematically but also just the tenacity of the forecheck and the way we’re playing and maybe that’s a good sign for us. Special teams we’ve had a little bit of work on now, we saw some production from them, both penalty kill and power play, so that’s a good sign. But I would say yeah, closer to our identity.\n\n\u003e 5-on-5 we’re not getting enough done offensively, I think, in exhibition season so far. We haven’t held onto pucks in sustained attack time until tonight, tonight was the first night where we actually got it going for a little while. Some polish around the net seems to always be what we’re looking for and that has to be there again. I would say throughout the exhibition season it’s slowly been improving. Tonight, it got closer to what we’ve what we wanted offensively. Defensively, knock on wood, we haven’t given up much and when we have the goaltenders have been there for us. Work in progress, like every other team.\n\n\u003e There were some concepts that we’re trying to bring in. Let’s face it, we’ve probably had 20 minutes of power-play time really, and discussions and meetings, so we can’t get it all done at once. The one thing that we did have was a lot of the pieces to a unit tonight in the lineup. That’s one of the difficult things as a team or as a staff, is when a lot of guys are still trying out for the team, you never really get your full units and or your penalty kill pairs. I hope that will start to happen this week.\n\n\u003e I couldn’t be happier for that guy. I’m talking about an exhibition game, it sounds like we’re in game seven, but for what he’s gone through, to claw his way back. He got better as the night went on I really thought. His first period was his tough period, it was happening fast but he got into the game quickly. If he’s feeling good and the leg is feeling good, we’ll keep playing him and try to get him up and running. A good first night for him.\n\n\u003e Leadership isn’t always when you’re in the lineup, it’s what you do to get back for your teammates too. He epitomizes it, so he deserved that tonight.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.742382442Z","tags":null},"/PRESEASON-FINAL-Kings-2-Golden-Knights-1-OT-Fiala-Copley-McLellan":{"title":"PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 2, Golden Knights 1 OT – Fiala, Copley, McLellan","content":"\n# PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 2, Golden Knights 1 OT – Fiala, Copley, McLellan\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-09-26 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 2, Golden Knights 1 OT – Fiala, Copley, McLellan](http://lakingsinsider.com/2022/09/26/preseason-final-kings-2-golden-knights-1-ot-fiala-copley-mclellan/)\n2022-09-26 | [[LA Kings Insider]] |  [[PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 2, Golden Knights 1 OT – Fiala, Copley, McLellan]] \n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Pheonix Copley]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings went to overtime for the second straight night in the preseason but came away with their first victory, a 2-1 win over the Vegas Golden Knights on Monday evening at T-Mobile Arena.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Pheonix Copley]]\n\u003e It was good, it was a battle, I got to get some game situation stuff in, which gets ramped up during camp but you don’t really get that kind of game situation stuff until you’re in a game. It was good to get my feet wet and now on to the next one.\n\n\u003e A lot of it is traffic stuff, guys are driving to the net, trying to get in your way so you can’t see and obviously the intensity gets ramped up in these games. I’d say the intensity and traffic are the two biggest things that kind of changed from summer skates and the scrimmages in camp.\n\n\u003e Yeah, I mean I knew I was going in at some point a second \\[period] so just 10 minutes earlier, it is what it is, just a little sooner than I thought. At the same time, it’s kind of just “I’ve got to get in there and do my thing.”\n\n\u003e Yeah, definitely, that’s part of the job, you have to be ready when that happens and you have to go in and you’re there for the team. That’s just part of the gig.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e I think tonight was an easier game for us to evaluate. We got to see more players in common situations. Penalty kill and power play, those are situations where the bench gets shortened and we haven’t had any work on them yet. 5-on-5, we did some good things, we did some things that we’ve actually worked on poorly, so we have to fix some areas of our game. Still, it’s back-to-back in the exhibition season, game two, there’s things we can be happy with and then there’s part of the game that we have to fix.\n\n\u003e Well, he doesn’t need many opportunities, I don’t think, to score. He had very few chances, yet he scored a goal and set up a nice one in overtime. Obviously the offensive instincts are there. I think it’s going to take them some time to gel as a line and figure each other out, figure out how we’re going to play the game as a group. It won’t be any different than Phil Danault when he arrived last year, it took him four or five games just to figure everything out, but we’re excited about having him here and he seems to be fitting in real well.\n\n\u003e Well, you draw a few things on the board, you show a few video clips and you hope that it works. That’s why training camp is two weeks long and then you get some practice time to begin the season. We’ve got a practice, then we play on Wednesday again, so we’ll try and add an element to our game tomorrow that skate. That could very well be a piece of either the power play or the penalty kill and see if we can implement it on Wednesday.\n\n\u003e Phoenix knew he was going in today, we were going to split the night as it was and after the first, Cal didn’t feel real good. He went in and knowing you’re going in at that point may give you a better chance to prepare even. He loosened up, he got ready between periods and when he went in, I thought he played very well in the last 40 minutes.\n\n\u003e He felt something and instead of pushing him through it, it makes no sense. We’ll evaluate him and we’ll see where he is tomorrow.\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.742382442Z","tags":null},"/PRESEASON-FINAL-Kings-2-Sharks-3-OT-McLellan-takeaways-+-Clarke-preseason-debut-and-notes":{"title":"PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 2, Sharks 3 OT – McLellan takeaways + Clarke preseason debut and notes","content":"\n# PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 2, Sharks 3 OT – McLellan takeaways + Clarke preseason debut and notes\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-09-25 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 2, Sharks 3 OT – McLellan takeaways + Clarke preseason debut and notes](http://lakingsinsider.com/2022/09/25/preseason-final-kings-2-sharks-3-ot-mclellans-takeaways-clarkes-preseason-debut-notes/)\n2022-09-25 | [[LA Kings Insider]] |  [[PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 2, Sharks 3 OT – McLellan takeaways + Clarke preseason debut and notes]] \n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jared Shafran]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n- [[Jonathan Quick]]\n- [[Carl Grundstrom]]\n\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings came up short in their first game of the 2022 preseason, falling in overtime to the San Jose Sharks by a score of 3-2 at the SAP Center on Sunday evening.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e Well, the flow part didn’t exist for both teams. It was a long night, a lot of penalties. Obviously, we’ve got to get better in some areas as far as stick infractions and holding and hooking and use our legs a little bit more, but if they’re ever going to call a lot, now’s a good time for it. I thought the penalties took a lot of players out of the game for us particularly early, but even in the second period on the power play, it took a lot of players away. Tough night to evaluate. Some guys were noticeably good and as always, there’s a couple of disappointments but for night one, we’re fairly pleased.\n\n\u003e Well, he’s got a lot of experience and he trained quite hard over the summer. So he’s been on the ice for a while now. I believe his body probably felt really good. He was tracking the puck well, it’s a lot to ask right off the bat, but if anybody can do it, he can and he proved again, he could get it done.\n\n\u003e A lot of the things that we thought we would. Poised with the puck, good playmaking, read the ice well, for him it’ll be getting acclimatized to heavier forechecks, perhaps some craftier, smarter players on the forecheck that are reading where the puck might go to. More time on the power play of course. We haven’t even talked about power play yet, we just put guys out and let them play. But I thought overall, he handled his minutes well and had an impact on the game.\n\n\u003e We get to choose our lineup. It doesn’t matter who dresses what, we’re evaluating our players and the fact that we got to play against a pretty good team tonight was good for us. It was a big challenge for our players and a good evaluation tool for us. But the veterans on both teams are managing themselves. They’re trying to get themselves ready, they know how long the season is, and I think it’s sometimes misleading when you look at number of veterans in the lineup versus rookies.\n\n\u003e It was, he had a tough first period, simply because of minutes and flow and rhythm, but as the game wore on he did the things he needed to do. He played in straight lines, he was physical player and got to the blue paint, which is an area of the game I didn’t think we did a real good job of but he was one that did get there.\n\n\n### [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\u003e It was fun. It’s cool to see the superstars on their team, see quality NHLers all over the ice. They’re bringing it. They’re getting warm for the season and they’re bringing their best they can and it’s challenging but I thought I tried to step it up in the second and third. Definitely some nerves in the first, maybe I was gripping the stick a little too tight but I thought I got more comfortable throughout the game and I thought I was making more plays and I was pretty satisfied with how the second half of my game went.\n\n\u003e Definitely, the first was pretty much all killing and the second was all on the man-advantage. It’s a big swing there, you gotta get adjusted and get ready for both sides. But you know, I thought we did a good job, we were phenomenal on the kill today. We didn’t even give them any shots and our power play was pretty good too. If you look at our shots we probably had like 15. I’m not even seeing the numbers but I’m guessing. Would have been nice to bury a couple and I think we had a couple of really quality chances and we were definitely pretty happy with our shifts when we came off at times but when you look at a zero in the goal column there it’s frustrating even when we know we had some really high quality looks.\n\n\u003e Oh, he’s an absolute rock. It’s crazy seeing all the highlights on TV but you know it’s so much more calming when he’s actually back there and especially there was a lot of nerves for a lot of us today but he was so calm, cool and collected back there. He was making the big save, they had a really high quality chance eight seconds of the game and he was he was up for the challenge. You can just tell he’s a pro and he’s always ready for any moment. He definitely kept us in it. They could have put up three, four or five maybe in the first period but he held it to one and we’re really grateful for that to give us a chance in the game.\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.742382442Z","tags":null},"/PRESEASON-FINAL-Kings-4-Ducks-5-Vilardi-Edler-McLellan":{"title":"PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 4, Ducks 5 – Vilardi, Edler, McLellan","content":"\n# PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 4, Ducks 5 – Vilardi, Edler, McLellan\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n 2022-10-04   | [[LA Kings Insider]]  | [PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 4, Ducks 5 – Vilardi, Edler, McLellan](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/04/preseason-final-kings-4-ducks-5-vilardi-edler-mclellan/)\n\n## Contributors:\n- [[Jared Shafran]]\n\n## Players\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Alex Edler]]\n- [[Cal Petersen]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings had their highest offensive output of the preseason Tuesday night in Anaheim, but were unable to hold a pair of two-goal leads and came up short to the Ducks at the Honda Center, losing 5-4.\n\n## Notes\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]] - 2 goals\n- [[Arthur Kaliyev]]  - 1 goal\n- [[Tobias Bjornfot]] - 1 goal\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e Some good evidence that’s what you’re always looking for as a coach. I thought we started well and our game grew as the night went on. Got the lead into the midway point of the second and similarly to the game in in LA the other night, started to give it back a little bit and took four penalties in a row. That didn’t help; two of them were in the offensive zone. And then I didn’t like our overall team engine. We made mental mistakes and is that because of fatigue or is it because of shift length? That played a role in that as well.\n\n\u003e I think it’s starting to happen, yeah. And that’s that evidence that we’re looking for. There’s guys that are elevating their games, there’s some that are falling off and showing maybe they’re not quite ready and then there’s some that we’re waiting for. And I think the ones that are elevating are great. The ones that are falling off, that happens. The ones we’re waiting for are the ones that have to get going. In fairness to them, some have only played two games. For whatever approach each team takes to training camp and how many games different guys get, we’re five games in and we’ve had key players that have only played two nights. We’ve got two more games coming up and we’ll try and get them in as much as we possibly can and we have to take that into consideration but a lot of teams in the league are like that too.\n\n\u003e Well, one it looks like he’s having a lot of fun and I think that’s a huge part of it so give him credit for being enthusiastic and being excited and his teammates love playing with him right now that’s a real good sign. The way he’s using his body to protect pucks and keep plays alive. Power play, we’ve given him a bit of a new role and he’s accepting of that and he seems to be in command of it. There’s a lot of positives from [[Gabe Vilardi]].\n\n\u003e Yeah, we kept some plays alive, we were in a position where we needed to be, we had some looks to the net. I think we won a face-off and we didn’t get through the goaltenders eyes which, at six-on-five, you better have somebody going through those eyes. So that was a disappointment, but the general structure for not having worked on it very much or at all was a carryover from last year and they did a good job there.\n\n### [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n\u003e Yeah it was a 5-4 game so a lot of goals, a lot of power plays, PKs, so obviously that’s going to create more opportunities. We’ve got to find ways to score goals so I mean it’s a good thing but we didn’t come out on the right end of it.\n\n\u003e I’m playing the net-front, moving around, I’m just kind of reading off them and I’m trying to find open areas back door kind of like I did on the first goal there. Yeah, I’m comfortable there, just kind of tapped into them and just trying to get open on that back side.\n\n\u003e Very good stick. Like it’s a very high skill level that I don’t know if it’s undercover like very hard to see but when I play with him you really notice how good his stick is, how many pucks he tips, how any pucks are going out of the zone and he somehow knocks it out of the air and then he’s just a very smart player so it makes it easier on everyone he’s playing with when you’re playing with smart guys. -- on [[Phillip Danault]]\n\n### [[Alex Edler]]\n\u003e We’re all trying to get ready for the season and trying to find out game, trying to find the chemistry and trying to execute our game plan and that’s what we have to continue to work on.\n\n\u003e I think we’re all pretty clear on what our game is and what we need to do and we showed a lot last year and what made us successful so that’s just what we’ve got to do.\n\n\u003e Yeah, I mean it’s been a while since I was in that kind of situation. So it was fun, it was fun to be out there and be part of it. Too bad we couldn’t get one.\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.742382442Z","tags":null},"/PRESEASON-FINAL-Kings-4-Golden-Knights-6-Kempe-Durzi-McLellan":{"title":"PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 4, Golden Knights 6 – Kempe, Durzi, McLellan","content":"\n# PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 4, Golden Knights 6 – Kempe, Durzi, McLellan\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n 2022-10-07   | [[LA Kings Insider]]  | [PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 4, Golden Knights 6 – Kempe, Durzi, McLellan](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/06/preseason-final-kings-4-golden-knights-6-kempe-durzi-mclellan/)\n\n## Contributors:\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n## Players\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n- [[Sean Durzi]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings fell by a 6-4 final in their second to last game of the preseason, the annual Frozen Fury tilt in Salt Lake City.\n\n## Notes\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]] scored his third goal in the last two pre-season games.\n\n### [[Adrian Kempe]]\n\u003e I think it’s been getting better and better. I think the power play has been good ever since the first game. Five on five, I feel like we’ve been getting better and better throughout the preseason. We had some ups and downs tonight, but overall we had some good looks, obviously scored one goal and one goal that they couldn’t see was in. I think that’s something positive to build on, tough that we lost but I think it’s going in the right direction.\n\n\u003e Yeah, I think both units have been doing great on power play. We have got some structure to it, we have guys who can play everywhere, we have a lot of players who can shoot the puck. We changed up some things from previous years and it’s working so far. You’ve got to be prepared, when season starts. team’s are going to be scouting, they’re going to know what we’re going to do, so we’ll need some other plans. I think overall right now it’s looking good.\n\n\u003e I mean, go back tomorrow and look at what we could have done better tonight. I think overall, our game is coming together. Still a couple of parts in the game where we can get better but overall, I think we played two good periods tonight and we needed to play three to beat this team or any team in the league. There’s those couple of things, but I think we’re moving in the right direction and we’re happy.\n\n### [[Sean Durzi]]\n\u003e Yeah, at the beginning of the game, I mean I was pretty fired up for the game. Even though it’s an exhibition, it was a lot of excitement, a lot of energy, it felt great to be out there with the guys again competing. I probably wanted a little bit of a better game, that’s just the way it goes.\n\n\u003e Yeah, right away, it’s defensive communication with my teammates and making reads in the d-zone. It happens quick, especially after not playing and coming right into it. Talking to guys, you want to make that switch a little quicker, give them a little less time and I think I was just a step slow with my reads, but I’m going to work at it, it’s just reps, talking about teammates and going over the video. It’s getting back into that groove and being hard on myself but learning from it. We don’t have much time here, so I’ve got to get going.\n\n\u003e Although it’s an exhibition game, we’re here to win and I think as a team that’s important to approach every single game the same way and know what our identity is, build our identity and trust it. Quite honestly, it’s what preseason is for, it’s what you practice for, it’s how you play. For the team, it’s like I said just sticking together and playing for each other. Personally, I got first game under my belt tonight and like I said, making reads, talking to my teammates, getting used to playing with them again.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e Yes and no, I don’t think it’s ever complete because there are guys that elevate, guys that fall off. The best thing that I can tell you is that there’s a group that we’re really happy with and there’s a group where a lot of them aren’t here anymore, there’s still a few that aren’t quite going to get it done. That’s just the way it is, not everybody can play. Our big concern is that middle group, what are they going to do and when are they going to do it? We’ve got three or four days left here before we’ve got to play that team again. Obviously, both clubs are going to get better, they’re going to put different players in the lineup but we’ve given up 10 goals in the last six periods we played. That’s not who we are and that’s not how we should be playing.\n\n\u003e It’s a little bit of both, the lineups have gotten stronger and on one side of the coin, we’ve been able to score a lot more and I think sometimes when that’s begins to happen, you forget who you are, you want to get out and, everybody wants to be a goal scorer. There were situations on the rink today, where we had to decide whether we were going to be on the North or the South side of the puck and players that normally would make good decisions in those situations chose the wrong side. I know they’re better than that and that’s why we’re waiting for them. They’ve got to make these decisions now instead of seven, eight, ten games into the season, when they realize it’s a little bit too late. So, not much we can do, we’re counting on them, we trust that they will. One more game to prep and then away we go.\n\n\u003e It’s amazing what can happen in two weeks. Players get their legs underneath them, they get a sense of timing, they have some spacial awareness on the ice. When players are coming at them, it starts to speed up a little bit and [[Sean Durzi]] is jumping in at that point, that’s going to be the same thing with [[Viktor Arvidsson]]. It’s not an easy thing to do, but I thought he did some good things on one side of the puck and others that he has to sharpen up.\n\n\u003e Yeah, you know what, every time we come here, the fanbase here in Salt Lake City is a really good hockey one. It’s not just a basketball city or a college city, it’s a hockey city. From what I hear, the minor hockey programs are really strong, the game is growing and to have that type of crowd turnout and cheer for their favorite team, it’s really important. We appreciate them.\n\n ","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.742382442Z","tags":null},"/PRESEASON-FINAL-Kings-6-Ducks-3-Arvidsson-Kaliyev-McLellan":{"title":"PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 6, Ducks 3 – Arvidsson, Kaliyev, McLellan","content":"\n# PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 6, Ducks 3 – Arvidsson, Kaliyev, McLellan\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n 2022-10-08   |   | [PRESEASON FINAL – Kings 6, Ducks 3 – Arvidsson, Kaliyev, McLellan](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/08/preseason-final-kings-6-ducks-3-arvidsson-kaliyev-mclellan/)\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n## Players\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n- [[Arthur Kaliyev]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings capped off the preseason with a 6-3 victory over the Anaheim Ducks on Saturday afternoon at Crypto.com Arena.\n\n## Notes\n### [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n\u003eIt was good. A little bit excited and a little nervous too, after being hurt, coming off of the surgery and the injury, but it was fun. It was awesome to be back on the bench and to get back into the game.\n\n\u003e Yeah, absolutely. It was so good to be back, it was good to just be with my teammates and around my teammates for the last week. Just being able to practice with them again and now play, it’s been really good.\n\n\u003e Absolutely. It doesn’t matter who I play with, but us three as a line have been so good with each other, both on and off the ice, in practices and during the games. It obviously helps a lot.\n\n### [[Arthur Kaliyev]]\n\u003e Just playing hard everywhere, winning battles and making plays, I’m not thinking about just scoring, but it just comes along with it. You get your chances from just playing hard everywhere.\n\n\u003e Whatever is open, I just try to find open space \\[in the offensive zone]. Whether it’s closer to the net or farther away, wherever there is open ice, I’m just trying to find that space.\n\n\u003e We have a lot of intensity on that unit, good puck movement and we’ve gotten a lot of shots on net, which has created a lot of rebounds. It’s been good and hopefully we can keep it going into the regular season.\n\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e The first period was probably our best first period of the preseason. Often, when you start with a power play right off the bat, it can dictate where that period goes and our power play was strong at that point. It helped us to get on our toes and get going. The game as a whole, I thought we gave it back a little bit in the second period. It started with a power play, the penalties are a common theme, but the third was a pretty good lockdown period.\n\n\u003eWe’ve spent some time, still not enough, working on some concepts, changing a few things. They are grasping the ideas and now it’s about execution, we’ve seen some good movement. The one thing that we can’t help them with is the finish, and we had a couple of open nets that we double-clutched or missed. Hopefully that comes more naturally as time goes on.\n\n\u003e It was \\[important] and we treated at least the first 50 minutes of it trying to get a few matches, trying to game simulate what the regular season will feel like. Play the top lines a little bit more, get their minutes up to see what that feels like and then down the stretch, when we got that lead, we pulled back as we would maybe in the regular season and got our third and fourth lines out, who I thought played a really good, solid game for those six players. It felt more like the regular season.\n\n\u003e Pretty rewarding, same comment as we had with Sean Walker. [[Viktor Arvidsson|Arvi]] means a lot to our team, he completes the identity of that Danault and Moore line. I thought, of all the players we had coming back who had some sort of injury, he had probably the most energy and polish. Perhaps that’s because we played a full lineup too, but he had a good night. He told me on the bench he felt good, we tried to run him a little bit more down the stretch. A couple of good practices coming up and hopefully he’s ready to play in the real matches.\n\n\u003e There’s some positives from tonight, the win, the power play at certain points looked good, the penalty kill did its job, but you’re asking me more about roster spots, who’s going and who’s staying. I don’t know that the plan is going to change a lot based on tonight’s game. I obviously had zero time to sit down with Blakey and his staff, we’re only 10 minutes since the game ended.

He has to play like he can play. He's an NHL goaltender. He's an outstanding young man that's played extremely well at this level. We're trying, just like we would with forwards and defensemen, to get him to where he can be. He has to be better.\n\n\u003e When I look at the start we had, I thought we played the way we wanted to play. We played fast. We were aggressive, forced them into situations where they had to turn the puck over. Things were going pretty well for us. Even after the first goal, I thought we responded well. By the time it got to three, unfortunately, it wasn't the same way anymore.\n\n### [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\u003e Being down 3-0 after the first period certainly doesn't help. I didn't think our play was that bad. Just a couple tough breaks. We're down 3-0 and then you're obviously playing catch up. You're trying to make something happen. It didn't happen tonight.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.74638256Z","tags":null},"/Petersen-starts-Edler-cleared-Carter-on-culture-10th-reunion":{"title":"Petersen starts - Edler cleared - Carter on culture, 10th reunion","content":"\n# Petersen starts - Edler cleared - Carter on culture, 10th reunion\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                          |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-20 | [[The Forum Report]] | [Petersen starts - Edler cleared - Carter on culture, 10th reunion](https://theforumreport.com/petersen-starts-edler-cleared-carter-on-culture-10th-reunion/) |\n| 2022-10-20 | [[The Forum Report]] | [[Petersen starts - Edler cleared - Carter on culture, 10th reunion]]                                                                                         |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jon Rosen]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Forum Club.

It could’ve been a three-goal deficit, and that’s a tough one to come back from.\n\n\u003e We got an outstanding effort by our goaltender and we still had a chance to win – had a chance for a point, really – but obviously the focus is going to be on the play at the end, which makes no sense. It’s hard to defend it, but our team gave up 51 shots on goal tonight. And when you look at the night, the first goal against, just terrible game management coming out of the penalty box and not being aware. The second one’s on the back end of a power play. You have to rewind the video a little bit. We were on the power play, we negated it with an offensive zone penalty, so terrible game management there. Third one, an actual power play, and the fourth one was actual stupidity. So a lot of it was self-inflicted. But you have to give them a lot of credit – they put a lot of pressure on us and created a lot of turnovers and a lot of pressure on our net, so we’ve got work to do.\n\n\u003e Knowing where the puck is coming out of the penalty box on a line change. You’ve got to be aware of that. Missing the net on that play. The end, a set breakout that we work on all the time. You’ve got numerous options. So that is all game management – that’s getting engaged and ready to go. Their team did a better job of it than we did tonight.\n\n### [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n\u003e I thought we were good in the first and third. There wasn’t much flow in the second – a lot of penalties. It was a weird period. I felt we had one shift every 10 minutes just because of penalties and stuff like that. But yeah, we’re good when we get in the O-zone. We ‘ve just got to keep doing the things in the D-zone. And once we get in the O-zone, [[Alex Iafallo|A.I.]]’s a really hard working guy, very smart, hungry … and [[Quinton Byfield|Q]] is pretty gifted with the puck, too. So, we’ve just got to get to the O-zone.\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.74638256Z","tags":null},"/Practice-10-12-Identity-Through-3-Periods-+-Notes-on-Vilardis-Speed-Fourth-Goal-Looking-Ahead-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"Practice 10-12 - Identity Through 3 Periods + Notes on Vilardis Speed, Fourth Goal, Looking Ahead - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# Practice 10-12 - Identity Through 3 Periods + Notes on Vilardis Speed, Fourth Goal, Looking Ahead - LA Kings Insider\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-12 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [Practice 10-12 - Identity Through 3 Periods + Notes on Vilardi's Speed, Fourth Goal, Looking Ahead - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/12/practice-10-12-identity-through-3-periods-notes-on-vilardis-speed-fourth-goal-looking-ahead/)\n2022-10-12 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[Practice 10-12 - Identity Through 3 Periods + Notes on Vilardis Speed, Fourth Goal, Looking Ahead - LA Kings Insider]]\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Alex Iafallo]]\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003eThe Kings hit the ice this morning for practice in between games against Vegas last night and Seattle to come tomorrow.\n\u003eGame 1 versus Vegas could probably be summed up in one word, which Todd McLellan reinforced this morning – Second. \n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e We were second to everything. You could look at it from an analytics standpoint, use all the stats you want, but there’s a reason for those stats. When we needed to be first, we were second. We were slow, poor execution, second everywhere.\n\n\u003e I think that we had an idea of what we wanted to be last year, even the year before that probably. Sometimes you add really good players to your lineup and we’ve done that and you might want to try and be something you’re not. We’re 60 minutes into a season and the first two questions I’ve gotten are about identity and you guys are doing the exact same thing that I’m doing, you’re comparing it to last year and that’s my whole point, it starts all over again. What do you want to be, how can we win, what should we be. We’re figuring that out right now.\n\n\u003e The first thing that I did was I reminded our players that every year is a new year and you take on your own identity again. If you can go back to losing game seven in Edmonton, to that press conference, I said it would be hard, it starts all over again and you reinvent yourself year after year after year. The only comparable we have after three periods was last year, so now we take three periods of hockey this year and we compare it to what was there last year and we weren’t even close. As we go forward now, we’ll have to lay game two against game one because now we’re starting to get this year’s evidence. Maybe we’re going to be a loose, gambling, score five per night team and get it done that way, I don’t know, but that looked like how we wanted to play. If we feel as a group that’s where our identity has to go and we’re going to try it that way, great, but I’m not betting on it. We either reestablish who we are, or we try it a different way.\n\n### On [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n\u003e Personally, I think, and the coaching staff thinks, that he’s a step quicker. He looks a little faster, some of that’s confidence, some of its feeling good. He feels good about himself, about his game, his teammates are excited for him. There’s a lot of real positive things in his world right now and we’ve got to keep them there. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e For sure, yeah. It’s great to see. He’s definitely put his work in and he’s gotten a lot better and he’s definitely faster than he was the year before. It’s been great to see and I’m looking forward to playing with him. -- [[Alex Iafallo]]\n\n\u003e I do see that. I think there was a play in the preseason when it wasn’t an icing, but the other team’s defenseman had a lot of space on him and he caught him, stripped the puck and we got a chance off of it. Even on his backchecks, he’s getting back there quickly. He’s creating a lot off the forecheck, I think he’s definitely made a big improvement over the summer. -- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.74638256Z","tags":null},"/Practice-10-14-Off-To-Minny-Getting-on-the-road-todays-alignment-Arvidsson-skates-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"Practice 10-14 - Off To Minny - Getting on the road, todays alignment, Arvidsson skates - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# Practice 10-14 - Off To Minny - Getting on the road, todays alignment, Arvidsson skates - LA Kings Insider\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-14 | [[LA Kings Insider]]  | [Practice 10-14 - Off To Minny - Getting on the road, todays alignment, Arvidsson skates - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/14/practice-10-14-off-to-minny-getting-on-the-road-todays-alignment-arvidsson-skates/)\n2022-10-14 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[Practice 10-14 - Off To Minny - Getting on the road, todays alignment, Arvidsson skates - LA Kings Insider]]\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n- [[Trevor Moore]]\n- [[Brendan Lemieux]]\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003eThe Kings hit the ice this morning for practice in El Segundo before heading off to the airport to begin the first roadtrip of the season. The games are coming hot and heavy on this trip, with the Kings set to play five games in eight nights, beginning tomorrow evening in Minnesota against the Wild. The Kings will also visit Detroit, Nashville, Pittsburgh and Washington on this trip, with four of those five teams in the postseason last year, and the fifth a team that added at the NHL level in the offseason.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e We’ve got 80 left and 41 of them are going to be on the road so it’s really early in the year, get out on the road while we’re fresh, bond a little bit. It sounds like a cliche, coaches use that all the time, but it’ll be good for us to get away. The one thing that we don’t get and that we do need is a lot of practice time on this trip, but that’s the way it goes.  -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e Yeah, I think so. When you’re on the road, it’s only hockey and it’s just the guys and hockey, which is good. You can go to dinner most nights on the road and like I said, it’s just the guys, so it’s a good time to get to know people and it’s just nice to spend time together. Especially after a couple losses, I think it can turn things around for us.  -- [[Trevor Moore]]\n\n\u003e Yeah, definitely. We spend enough time in LA, I spent the whole offseason here, so it’s good to get out and get on the road and be with the guys. I think just spending time together on the plane, on buses and whatnot, it’ll be good. Get out for some dinners, enjoy ourselves a little bit, just us as a group, away from the families and whatnot. It’ll be fun.  -- [[Brendan Lemieux]]\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.74638256Z","tags":null},"/Practice-Notebook-10-5":{"title":"Practice Notebook 10-5","content":"\n# Practice Notebook 10-5\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-05   | [[LA Kings Insider]]  | [Practice Notebook 10-5](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/05/practice-notebook-10-5-three-groups-of-players-durzis-progression-alternate-jersey-schedule/)\n\n## Contributors:\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n## Players\n- [[Phillip Danault]]\n- [[Trevor Moore]]\n- [[Sean Durzi]]\n\n## Summary\n- Practice Notebook 10/5 – “Three Groups” of players, Durzi’s Progression, alternate jersey schedule\n\u003e Another day of practice here at Toyota Sports Performance Center as we approach Opening Night six days from today. The Kings are at the point in the process where they need to start making decisions on final roster moves. [[Todd McLellan]] described the group right now as players in one of three distinct categories, all with varying degrees of importance over the course of these next two games.\n\n## Notes\n\n\u003e They’re get ready and polish games. I think we have players right now that fall into three different buckets. We have guys that have had really good camps and are excelling, we probably don’t have to worry about them. We have players that have struggled lately and it’s clear they’re maybe not ready, we probably don’t have to worry about them. Then we have a group in the middle that is still finding their way.  -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e Take Phil Danault’s line, they’ve only played in two games, one was in Ontario, which was an awful night under different circumstances, so they’re still trying to find their game. We’ll make sure that in these next two games, we’re trying to get ready and feel good about ourselves individually and collectively, and then go from there, but the opportunity part of it is gone for a lot of players. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n### Sean Durzi shoulder surgery rehab\n\n\u003e We’re confident that he’s done the work. The people that needed to sign off on it have signed off on it. Now, it’s about getting him reps in game situations to make sure he feels comfortable and confident in his own game and the team game. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e I’m very confident. I mean, at the end of the day, I’ve got a good team around me that will make the best decision but personally, I’m confident and feeling better than ever and I’m excited. I’m enjoying it, but at the end of the day you want to play, it’s why you do it, it’s why you compete and that feeling of competition every day is what I’m looking forward to. I’m one-hundred percent confident, feeling good, we’ll see what the future brings here. -- [[Sean Durzi]]\n\n\u003e It’s been good, I’ve had a couple of good weeks and we’ve got two games coming up so we’ll see what happens there but feeling good, feeling better every day. Like I said before, it’s just nice that it feels better than it did last season.

He can play in all situations. He’s big, he’s strong, he skates extremely well for a big guy, he makes plays, he makes people around him better. When he wants to, he can go win a game by himself. He hounds pucks, he creates turnovers by himself through his skating and how strong he is. -- [[Cory Stillman]], Coach of Sudbury Wolves\n\n\u003e He has a lot of qualities that make him attractive as a player. He’s an elite skater, he’s a big man in a big body, but he has the speed and agility of a smaller man. It’s incredible how he can turn on a dime and the speed he can do it with. He has great vision, a pass-first kind of guy but he has a pro shot, too. We feel he was the best player in the OHL last season and probably the greatest Sudbury Wolf player that’s ever come through here. -- [[Rob Papineau]], GM of Sudbury Wolves\n\n\u003e He’s a unique package. He’s 6-foot-4, can skate, he has the skill and very good vision. He makes a lot of plays, and when you have that kind of skill and that size, it makes him a special player that doesn’t come along too often. -- [[Alan Millar]], GM for Canada’s U18 Team\n\n\u003e I always want to be the first guy on the puck. I’m never afraid of going into a battle. I like to play fast, I want to use my speed to win races and use my speed to set up my teammates. -- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\n\u003e Byfield’s size and skating combination on its own would make him a top prospect, but he combines it with some of the best hands in this draft class. His ability to break a game open with a display of individual skill makes him the type of player that is likely too good for junior hockey beyond this season. -- NHL Scout\n\n\u003e The athletic tools and the skill are no doubt elite, but I question whether he sees the game at a high level. -- NHL Scout\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.74638256Z","tags":null},"/Prospect-Profile-An-Early-Look-at-Quinton-Byfield":{"title":"Prospect Profile - An Early Look at Quinton Byfield","content":"\n# Prospect Profile - An Early Look at Quinton Byfield\n\n| Date       | Site                   | Link                                                                                                                                   |\n| ---------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2019-10-03 | [[The Hockey Writers]] | [Prospect Profile - An Early Look at Quinton Byfield](https://thehockeywriters.com/prospect-profile-an-early-look-at-quinton-byfield/) |\n| 2019-10-03 | [[The Hockey Writers]] | [[Prospect Profile - An Early Look at Quinton Byfield]]                                                                                |\n\n## Contributors\n- \n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e _Eric Lindros._ \n\u003e That has been the tagline to describe Quinton Byfield recently.

Peak potential think Evgeni Malkin or a left-shot Ryan Getzlaf.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n- Made huge gains in two OHL seasons\n  \u003e Early in the year, when he didn’t have the puck, he wanted to chase it. In junior hockey, if you’re out of position, someone’s going to make a pass to your guy. Once he realized he should slow down, wait for it, and then attack and go get the puck, he got back into having it more. … As the season went on, and we got into playoffs, if their goalie was pulled, I had enough confidence that he could play in an odd-man situation to win the hockey game also.  -- [[Cory Stillman]]\n  \n  \u003e A player with his size and strength, and I think there’s more size and strength to come, but to able to have soft hands and vision and make plays and when players try to eliminate him, he can beat you with power or he can beat you with hands and hockey sense, so it makes him very, very tough to contain and a very attractive prospect obviously. -- [[David Gregory]]\n- Had a quiet WJC but the experience helped him grow\n  \u003e Playing with all the amazing talent and competing against the best players and best prospects going to the NHL, it was a lot of fun. I think I just tried to take some tips from a couple of the pro players on my team. They kind of showed me the ropes and gave me pointers. I tried to bring back (to the Wolves) all the tips and hints they gave me. The pace over there was a lot faster than the OHL, so I think I have more patience to slow down the game now in coming back from the world juniors. I think I can impact the game a lot more now.\n  \n  \u003e Just getting to watch \\[Lafreniere] and battle against him in practice, it really stepped up my game there. He does everything well. He even gets into the physical side as well, which kind of surprised me. He definitely brought a lot of energy to the table even with his skill. He had a couple of key goals for us. It was just nice getting to know him. -- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n- He is half Jamaican\n  \u003e Being top for something is always cool and being the top pick among players of colour would definitely be something really special to me. I think the game is changing and the NHL is becoming more diverse. Definitely that would get kids motivated to start playing hockey, knowing that they can play, and that hockey is for everyone. -- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n- Models his game after Malkin\n  \u003e It’s just an honour to be compared to that guy. He’s a soon-to-be Hall of Famer. I definitely watch as much Pittsburgh games as possible just to see what he does on the ice and how he plays. He’s a big, 200-foot centre and just the amazing offensive ability he has. Just how he plays is just unbelievable. I definitely watch him quite a bit and try and model my game after him. -- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n- His minor hockey stats were silly\n- He doesn’t use much tape on his stick\n- He collects bowties\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.74638256Z","tags":null},"/Prospects-talk-Draft-prep":{"title":"Prospects talk Draft prep","content":"\n# Prospects talk Draft prep\n\n| Date       | Site    | Link                                                                                                                 |\n| ---------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2020-04-08 | [[NHL]] | [Prospects talk Draft prep](https://www.nhl.com/video/prospects-talk-draft-prep/t-316290184/c-5372142?sf120504014=1) |\n| 2020-04-08 | [[NHL]] | [[Prospects talk Draft prep]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Mike Morreale]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Prospects Alexis Lafreniere, Tim Stuetzle, Quinton Byfield and Jamie Drysdale talk about their preparations for the 2020 NHL Draft\n\n\n## Players\n- Alexis Lafreniere\n- Tim Stuetzle\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n- Jamie Drysdale\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n- 0:50 Where are you and what's it like to prepare in such unusual circumstances?\n- \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.74638256Z","tags":null},"/Puck-Prose":{"title":"Puck Prose","content":"\n# Puck Prose\n\n| URL          | Feed     | Twitter                                |\n| ------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------- |\n| [Homepage]() | [Feed]() | [@twitterHandle](https://twitter.com/) | \n\n\n## Articles\n| Title | Source Link | Date Published |\n| ----- | ----------- | -------------- |\n|       |             |                |\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.74638256Z","tags":null},"/Questions-Face-Stars-Leading-into-Matchup-with-Kings":{"title":"Questions Face Stars Leading into Matchup with Kings","content":"\n# Questions Face Stars Leading into Matchup with Kings\n\n| Date       | Site                | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| ---------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-11-01 | [[Defending Big D]] | [Questions Face Stars Leading into Matchup with Kings](https://www.defendingbigd.com/2022/11/1/23433312/nhl-2022-dallas-stars-los-angeles-kings-game-preview-oettinger-heiskanen-lineups-game-keys) |\n| 2022-11-01 | [[Defending Big D]] | [[Questions Face Stars Leading into Matchup with Kings]]                                                                                                                                            |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Mark Zimmerman]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Injuries to two Dallas players.

There’s no right or wrong script to win a hockey game, and whether it was the three backdoor tap-ins or Jonathan Quick’s poke check to end a 3-on-0, they processed and reacted to many different game situations well.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Carl Grundstrom]]\n- [[Jonathan Quick]]\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e You’ve got to take what you’re given, and early in the year we were forcing some stuff and still getting rewarded. Tonight we took what was there.\n\n\u003e \\[[[Carl Grundstrom]]] was physical, he was aggressive between the whistles, he played hard, finished his checks, and that crap after is secondary. He’s still involved in it, which is fine. But I like what’s going on between the whistles. That’s way more important to the team.\n\n\u003e I wasn’t even aware of it. The next 100 are going to be a lot tougher than the first 100, and I’m only worried about 101 which is tomorrow in Dallas and we’ll have our hands full there.\n\n\u003e \\[[[Kevin Fiala]]] seems to be able to perform of a high level regardless of where he is. It allows with Gabe to play with some first line players for a little bit. It just feels better right now, looks better. Less chances against for the most part.\n\n### [[Carl Grundstrom]]\n\u003e You’ve got to stand up for yourself, too. I always try to do that. I don’t always talk, but sometimes you’ve got to fight back.\n\n### [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n\u003e I think Quickie played unreal today. They had clear-cut chances he made crazy saves on, and other than that, I thought we played a pretty solid game.\n\n### [[Jonathan Quick]]\n\u003e It’s like any other play – you’re kind of going through everything and what their options are, what you think they’re doing and preparing yourself for what you expect to happen.\n\n\u003e You’re looking for what-handed shot they are, one-timer or whatever. And then just try to be patient and make a read on what they’re doing.\n\u003e It’s like a 3-on-2. They’re still kind of looking for the same stuff. Obviously all the seams would open there, all the passing lanes are open, so everything’s an option.\\[...] you do it over and over again and come out more times than not if you’re playing the right way.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.74638256Z","tags":null},"/Quick-projected-Roy-expecting-150-supporters-Grundstrom-in-for-Kaliyev-M%C3%A4%C3%A4tt%C3%A4-on-LA-growth":{"title":"Quick projected - Roy expecting 150 supporters - Grundstrom in for Kaliyev - Määttä on LA growth","content":"\n# Quick projected - Roy expecting 150 supporters - Grundstrom in for Kaliyev - Määttä on LA growth\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-17 | [[The Forum Report]] | [Quick projected - Roy expecting 150 supporters - Grundstrom in for Kaliyev - Määttä on LA growth](https://theforumreport.com/quick-projected-roy-expecting-150-supporters-grundstrom-in-for-kaliyev-maatta-on-l-a-growth/) |\n| 2022-10-17 | [[The Forum Report]] | [[Quick projected - Roy expecting 150 supporters - Grundstrom in for Kaliyev - Määttä on LA growth]]                                                                                                                        |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jon Rosen]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e \n\n\n## Players\n- [[Arthur Kaliyev]]\n- [[Carl Grundstrom]]\n- [[Jonathan Quick]]\n- [[Matt Roy]]\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e “I think we were just good last year. We had that coming. The first year I was there, it was building, but last year, we took big steps. It was an exciting year for us. I don’t think it ended like we wanted it to – I think we had \\[higher aspirations] and it seems like they just got better over the summer, so I’m sure they’ll be a good team. -- Olli Maatta\n\n\u003e In my mind, similar to Detroit’s third line, they keep a lot of plays alive. The goal that Vilardi scored, it was a dead play, but somehow [[Quinton Byfield]] got a stick on it, kept the play alive. Spending more time in the other team’s offensive zone, protecting pucks better. They work really hard to get it, and they’ll hold onto it and make good plays. Just don’t give it back to ‘em. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.74638256Z","tags":null},"/Quinton-Byfield":{"title":"Quinton Byfield","content":"\n# Quinton Byfield\n\nNHL.com | Twitter\n-|-\n[Quinton Byfield](https://www.nhl.com/player/quinton-byfield-8482124) | [@byfield55](https://twitter.com/byfield55)\n\nPosition | Shoots | Height | Weight | Age | Birthday | Birthplace | Draft\n-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-\n C | L | 6'5\" | 220 | 20 | 2002-08-19 | Newmarket, ON, CAN | 2020 LAK, 1st rd, 2nd pk (2nd overall)\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date       | Site                    | Title                                                                                                                                |     |\n| ---------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --- |\n| 2022-11-06 | [[Pro Hockey Rumors]]   | [[Los Angeles Kings Loan Quinton Byfield To AHL]]       |\n| 2022-11-06 | [[The Athletic]]        | [[LA Kings Rasmus Kupari stepping up in Quinton Byfields absence]]                                                                   |     |\n| 2022-11-06 | [[LA Kings Insider]]    | [[Kings loan forward Quinton Byfield to AHL-Ontario -

Clark]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Family friends knew it. Others in the hockey community did, too. Quinton Byfield is special, they’d say. He’s going to do something big with hockey someday.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e I think I was pretty good at soccer. But the possibilities are next to none when it comes to making it and you are from Canada. I liked hockey a lot more and most of my buddies were hockey fans. My family always supported me and let’s say they supported me a little more with hockey because they loved it, too. I am glad it went that way.\n\n\u003e I think (the expectations) kind of started when I made it at (York-Simcoe Express). I had to make my way onto the roster. I was the tall guy, but uncoordinated a little bit. People probably did not think I was too good. Once I felt comfortable, I saw I could kind of be a good player. I started being a little bit better at hockey and it started from there. In my seven years at YSE, I kept growing and improved.\n\n\u003e I was fortunate to get all the lucky genes, I guess. My parents did not make me do just one sport. I got training in every sport. Whatever sport I liked the most, they let me do it and that was really good. It allowed me to become more of an athlete as well. The cool part is that’s how my parents grew up as well.\n\n\u003e It was an older TV with the box on the back. It was nice to spend time with him. It was really good. We would just talk hockey and be able to enjoy the game and watch them together. Back then it was just about the game and cheering for the team we wanted to win.\n\n\u003e I knew he was a huge supporter of mine and believed in me quite a bit. If he was here, I think he’d be super proud.\n\n\u003e I used to be a defenseman growing up and he was a good offensive defenseman. \\[Sergei Gonchar] was the catalyst on those Pittsburgh teams on the back end. He really did not get too much publicity with Crosby and Malkin, but still got attention and for me, he was the backbone.\n\n\u003e I’d probably say bantam is when I started to realize I had a little bit more to give. I started working really hard and it has worked out so far and hopefully, it keeps on working.\n\n\u003e Honestly, I was surprised. I was just a kid growing up just thinking about playing hockey and having fun with my friends. I was living in the moment and just wanted to give my team a chance to win. I never thought about it until later on and then I had to get serious about it, consider the real chances I had. It was definitely a surprise when people were saying that in the beginning.\n\n\u003e Stamkos is definitely one of those people I looked up to, so to get a picture with him was really cool. He was super kind and generous. He let us take two minutes of his time. The thing I learned was just being available and learning how to be available for a lot of people. It made my day. Hopefully, if I stop for someone to do the same, it can make that person’s day. All you have to do is just take a minute, pause and give back a little bit.\n\n\u003e I think I have been pretty fortunate with all the great things that have happened to me. I have been lucky enough to play and be healthy. Knock on wood, I have had a pretty good experience and giving back in any way I can, it is important to me.\n\n\u003e I think it is definitely something special and I want to be the highest Black drafted in the NHL. I think that would be something really special. I think that it shows that having guys like Evander Kane and Seth Jones and P.K. Subban getting drafted and being impact players helped me growing up. It gave me the example that I could do it some day. Maybe I could see myself as a player. Now it is my time and my turn to take that role.

But the thing is, you know, the period, as bad as the score was, I didn’t think our play was that bad.

We played fast, we were aggressive, we forced them into situations where they had to turn the puck over, and things were going pretty well for us. Even after the first goal, I thought we responded well, but by the time it got to three, unfortunately, it wasn’t the same way anymore, and obviously, we’d like to have a couple of those back in the first period.\n\n\u003e We’re trying, just like we would with forwards and defensemen, to get (Petersen) to where he can be, and he has to be better.

It’s been our best period pretty much all season long. I think guys are really confident now going into the third, especially with the lead. So that showed again today. We probably didn’t play our best hockey today, but you know what, we’re going home with two points against a very good hockey team.\n\n\u003e It shouldn’t be like this every time when \\[[[Pheonix Copley]]]’s in net. I know he saved us again, but we just got to make sure that we’re better. Better prepared, better in the first period too, because he is. He’s a perfect example and he’s leading the way every time he plays so we just have to make sure we were on his boat every time he plays this well.\n\n\u003e Special teams is always a big key and today we lost special teams and it’s not because of the PK, it was because of the power play. We never really got momentum out of it and I think they created even more chances than we did on the power play so that has to be better. I give them credit. They played a good PK, but you can’t get frustrated and once in a while you have to get it in deep too and work for it and we just didn’t do it. That’s something we would definitely have to address moving forward.\n\n\u003e \\[[[Alan Quine]]]’s smart and very skilled, a very likeable player. He’s been really solid for us. That’s what we need from him and I know he had a tough year last year and over the last couple of years, but I feel like he feels comfortable. I also think even he can be better too. I know it always looks good points-wise, but he’s definitely going in the right direction and we’re just happy to have him.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.74638256Z","tags":null},"/REIGN-FINAL-Reign-2-Condors-3-Sturm-Fagemo-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"REIGN FINAL – Reign 2, Condors 3 – Sturm, Fagemo - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# REIGN FINAL – Reign 2, Condors 3 – Sturm, Fagemo - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                     |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [REIGN FINAL – Reign 2, Condors 3 – Sturm, Fagemo - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/16/reign-final-reign-2-condors-3-sturm-fagemo/) |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[REIGN FINAL – Reign 2, Condors 3 – Sturm, Fagemo - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                  |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jared Shafran]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Samuel Fagemo]]\n- [[Pheonix Copley]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Marco Sturm]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e A third period goal by Samuel Dove-McFalls pushed the Bakersfield Condors (1-0-1) past the Ontario Reign (1-1-0) by a final score of 3-2 at Toyota Arena on Sunday afternoon in the first meeting of the season between the two Pacific Division rivals.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Marco Sturm]]\n\u003e I think, first of all, the opponent was a little different. They just a played a totally different game. Structurally they weren’t pretty, but they got the job done. They know they’re roles. They knew what they wanted to do, hey frustrated us a little bit five-on-five, and they wanted to score on the powerplay, and that’s exactly what they did.\n\n\u003e He was pretty good. I thought him and Tynan had a really good game. With his shot, he’s so dangerous at five-on-five and five-on-four. Now, we have to find a way to get many more shots like that. He was good today, and he needs to be. Our best players have to be the best players every night, and today we didn’t have enough.\n\n\u003e We’re not going to win every game. There will be games when we’re going to be behind. Like today, we tied it up and then I thought we felt really good and the bench was alive. It was a little quiet before we had good momentum. Then, all of a sudden, we got the goal against. A bad bounce, maybe bad luck, but it doesn’t matter. That’s something we just have to get better at and we have to learn from it and use it for the next game.\n\n\u003e I thought he was really solid. There’s still maybe one or two goals he might want back, but you can tell he’s a veteran goalie. We’re really lucky and we’re very happy to have him in there because he will give us a chance every night to win the hockey game.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.74638256Z","tags":null},"/REIGN-FINAL-Reign-2-Eagles-0-Sturm-Villalta-Andersson-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"REIGN FINAL – Reign 2, Eagles 0 – Sturm, Villalta, Andersson - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# REIGN FINAL – Reign 2, Eagles 0 – Sturm, Villalta, Andersson - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-11-03 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [REIGN FINAL – Reign 2, Eagles 0 – Sturm, Villalta, Andersson - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/11/03/reign-final-reign-2-eagles-0-sturm-villalta-andersson/) |\n| 2022-11-03 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[REIGN FINAL – Reign 2, Eagles 0 – Sturm, Villalta, Andersson - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                             |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jared Shafran]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Matt Villalta stopped all 31 shots he faced to record his second-career AHL shutout in a 2-0 blanking of the Colorado Eagles (3-5-0) by the Ontario Reign (7-1-0) on Thursday night at the Budweiser Events Center.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Matt Villalta]]\n- [[Lias Andersson]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Marco Sturm]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Marco Sturm]]\n\u003e It is a tough building. They have not just good fans, they also have a good team. They work extremely hard. They check really well and it’s those little details and like I told the guys after the first, special teams were probably going to make the difference and that’s how it was. We had to score on the power play to get the lead but I think it was overall a good solid team effort. We had great goaltending today, and our D came up big too.\n\n\u003e It’s not on purpose. The only thing we talked about is we wanted to have better starts. I think today we had a better start, but these guys are good hockey players and it seems like after the first period, they can crank it up again. And then in the third we’ve been pretty solid all year long. We stayed really calm and like today, they was no panic and our game was pretty clean. And it was nice to see but, I don’t think we do it on purpose but we’ll take those second periods.\n\n\u003e Yeah we had to change a few little things on the PK. I think we the coaches, we were not happy and since two-three games now it’s been much better. We need them. In this league, I’ve learned there’s going to be a lot of penalties both ways and we’ve just got to make sure we’re going to win those special teams and PK was good and PP got us a goal so that’s exactly what we want.\n\n\u003e Oh, it’s really nice. And you could tell the guys too, there’s no panic, because we know we have a guy in net, doesn’t matter who is in which night, they’re gonna give us a chance every night to win a hockey game. That’s what we want and I don’t care which league you’re in, we have solid goaltending and if those guys give you a chance to win every night, I think automatically your team is going to do really well as well.\n\n### [[Matt Villalta]]\n\u003e Yeah, I think coming in tonight obviously you have that in the back of your head and to be honest, it left a sour taste in my mouth all summer and it was just something that you never want to happen again after getting lit up like that, especially in game one of playoffs here. I think today I just wanted to go in there, have fun and just believe in myself and believe in my game and trust all the work that I put into it so far. I think just be able to get a result like that is a nice confidence boost and also the boys did a great job, especially on the PK in there at the end of the game just getting pucks out so that helped a lot.\n\n\u003e I think so. I think for guys that were here last year for sure. Everyone that played here we all remember what it’s like and just to move on and get a good game in this barn, it’s a good confidence builder for us even though it’s early in the season as well. I think it’s something good to build off of and I think obviously we have a few things we want to tidy up for Saturday, but nonetheless it’s a great step in the right direction for us.\n\n\u003e Yeah, they’re a big strong team and they like getting pucks to the net so it’s pretty important that you seal the ice, take that first half away and our D will have our backside so you know just being strong on our posts, trying to keep the puck on first half of the net I think that’s huge. And then also when it did get in front of the net, our D and some of our forwards did a great job of boxing guys out and let me see it.\n\n\u003e Yeah I’m gonna be honest with you, it kind of came across my mind at like the five minute mark in a second. I was like, ‘No, I’ve been here before, I’m not thinking about this. Worry about the next shot.’ And then about the nine minute mark left in the third period, same thing and I was like ‘Matt, just focus, get her done.’ And then time starts ticking down, the last few minutes, you start to get a little bit excited, but you just got to try and keep yourself at an even level and just nice to hear that final buzzer and get the result with all the boys.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.74638256Z","tags":null},"/REIGN-FINAL-Reign-2-Gulls-1-Sturm-Copley-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"REIGN FINAL – Reign 2, Gulls 1 – Sturm, Copley - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# REIGN FINAL – Reign 2, Gulls 1 – Sturm, Copley - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                 |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-21 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [REIGN FINAL – Reign 2, Gulls 1 – Sturm, Copley - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/21/reign-final-reign-2-gulls-1-sturm-copley/) |\n| 2022-10-21 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[REIGN FINAL – Reign 2, Gulls 1 – Sturm, Copley - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jared Shafran]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Led by goaltender Pheonix Copley, who made 44 saves in an outstanding effort, the Ontario Reign (3-1-0) spoiled the home opener for the San Diego Gulls (1-2-0) and earned a victory in the first game of the 2022-23 SoCal Series by a 2-1 final score on Friday night at Pechanga Arena.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Pheonix Copley]]\n\n## Staff\n- [[Marco Sturm]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Marco Sturm]]\n\u003e It was even fun for us to.

That’s just the bottom line. There’s nothing to hide. I think we all saw it, and hopefully the players did too. We knew they were going to push back out there and we had nothing to push back with. That’s probably the most disappointing part of it.\n\n\u003e It’s always a big part. Our PK was just not ready today and our power play didn’t get it done either. We can’t rely on just goaltending every night. Sometimes you have to look in the mirror and push back on nights like that. Unfortunately, only a few guys did that tonight.\n\n\u003e We’re going to try to learn from that one. Hockey is not always great. There are going to be a lot of ups and downs. We’ve all done it before. So far its been really good, so maybe we were due. We’ve had some games with really good goaltending where we didn’t play well. Today, it was just overall not good enough. We just have to make sure that it’s not going to happen again.\n\n### [[Alan Quine]]\n\u003e I think we had a game plan and we were right there, but then they got a couple quick ones on us. They’re a good team. We’ve been pretty fortunate with the way we’ve started the season, so that’s \\[a game] we can learn from and analyze and move on. Hopefully it will help us down the stretch.\n\n\u003e We’d like to capitalize more, especially on the five minute advantage, but it’s a new group for me and we haven’t had a ton of practice time. I think the more power plays we get, the better we’re going to click and gel off each other. Its just a learning game for us so we’ve got to regroup for the next one.\n\n\u003e We’re trying to react off of each and every team, and each and every period.

I think the game yesterday took a lot of energy out of both teams. They had the better start in the first period, but after that, I think we played pretty solid. Our goal is to play 60 minutes. It was nice to see how we responded. We want to put a team like that beside us right away. Hopefully we’ve learned a lesson and now we’re going to move on.\n\n\u003e \\[[[Matt Villalta]]] was really solid. He controlled a lot of rebounds and other stuff because they go to the net really hard. I thought Matty was really good today. Two big games and we got two big goaltending \\[performances] our of those two games. That was one of the big reasons why we won those two games.\n\n\u003e Right now, everyone is contributing something and that’s what we need. I think if you look at our lineup, that’s where we are right now. We have to tighten up a few things and we did a little bit better job today, but there’s still work to do. We know that we still have to play better, but playing back-to-back against San Diego is not easy, especially to go there for their home opener. Tight games like yesterday are not easy, so we’re glad we came home with four points.\n\n### [[Jacob Doty]]\n\u003e It’s nice. We play those guys a lot. I don’t know how many off the top of my head, but it’s a lot, and I can tell you that. Anytime you can take four of four from them, it’s a good feeling. Especially, a nice one on the road last night and this one was obviously a little more open for us, and we’ll take that. It was a good team win.\n\n\u003e Their guy tried to come off the wall and beat me to the middle and I was lucky enough to get a stick on it. I had a step and went to the backhand and made a move. I was actually trying to go five hole but got hooked a little bit. It ended up going off the post and in, but don’t ask how, right?\n\n\u003e It’s always nice to contribute, but that’s not necessarily my gig and I understand that. I have no issues with what I do. Obviously its nice to chip in, but I’m not going to change my game. It’s been going well, but we’ll see what happens.\n\n\u003e Back in Montana, there’s no permanent ice where I live until September 1. That’s a huge disadvantage for a professional hockey player. The decision for my family and I to stay in LA and train and workout was awesome, and it seems to be paying off. I feel really good. I had a great summer and I’ve just got to keep it going.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.74638256Z","tags":null},"/REIGN-FINAL-Reign-5-Silver-Knights-3-Sturm-Madden-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"REIGN FINAL – Reign 5, Silver Knights 3 – Sturm, Madden - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# REIGN FINAL – Reign 5, Silver Knights 3 – Sturm, Madden - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-18 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [REIGN FINAL – Reign 5, Silver Knights 3 – Sturm, Madden - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/18/reign-final-reign-5-silver-knights-3-sturm-madden/) |\n| 2022-10-18 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[REIGN FINAL – Reign 5, Silver Knights 3 – Sturm, Madden - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                         |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jared Shafran]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Ontario Reign (2-1-0) erased a first period deficit with two goals in the second and tacked on insurance in the third to defeat the Henderson Silver Knights (1-2-0) by a final score of 5-3 at Toyota Arena on Tuesday night. Five different scorers did the damage for Ontario, including forwards Rasmus Kupari (1-2=3) and Tyler Madden (1-1=2), who each had multi-point efforts.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Tyler Madden]]\n- [[Matt Villalta]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Marco Sturm]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Marco Sturm]]\n\u003e We had a really good start. Everyone was really going and the first goal against kind of broke us down a little bit. I think the momentum was gone all of a sudden. They had it and they had the lead. It was not the prettiest game, but that was just one of those games. I told the guys, hockey is not always pretty and those are the games that we have to win, and we did. I think we got a lot better in the third. We just controlled the game a little bit better. There’s still work to do but I’m happy and I think we’re happy with the win tonight.\n\n\u003e That was huge. That was the biggest kill, having almost two full minutes three against five. The guys did an outstanding job. I think \\[Villalta] was good in the net today. He looked pretty strong. Special teams is always really important in any league. There were a lot of penalties but I think it was good for us on the PK. We found a little bit of a rhythm. We know we have a good power play but we have to work for it too. It was nice to see that they responded too.\n\n\u003e I liked him. I think he rebounded really well after the first goal. Maybe he would want that one back, but he was involved. He was ready. He played the puck really well. That’s a big strength and he came up with big saves at the right times. He was really good tonight.\n\n\u003e That’s why I played them almost until the end. They deserved it. I know that with some of the penalties, they’re sometimes sitting on the bench a little longer than they wanted to, but that’s just part of the game. I think some other guys stepped up today and that was really nice to see.\n\n### [[Tyler Madden]]\n\u003e I felt good. I think my line played a great game. I love playing with those guys and we started off hot and continued the rest of the game. It was a good game. Any time you get the puck \\[to [[Akil Thomas]]] below the tops of the circles, it’s a good thing. He can rip it. I enjoyed playing with him and Dudas especially.\n\n\u003e I came down thinking pass the whole way and I think the goalie saw that. As soon as I picked my head up and looked at him, he was already cheating, so I saw short side and I just put it there.\n\n\u003e I think the first game was kind of just figuring it out a little bit. Coming back, I didn’t get that many skates before \\[the games] so it felt a little slow toward the end. Today, I was well prepared, did the right things, and felt pretty good out there.\n\n\u003e I think just playing all the games this year, and not just playing in them, but being a factor in every single one. It was a good start, but there’s a lot more to do.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.74638256Z","tags":null},"/REIGN-FINAL-Reign-8-Canucks-2-Sturm-Tynan-Grans-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"REIGN FINAL – Reign 8, Canucks 2 – Sturm, Tynan, Grans - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# REIGN FINAL – Reign 8, Canucks 2 – Sturm, Tynan, Grans - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date | Site | Link | \n| ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| 2022-10-14 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [REIGN FINAL – Reign 8, Canucks 2 – Sturm, Tynan, Grans - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/14/reign-final-reign-8-canucks-2-sturm-tynan-grans/)\n| 2022-10-14 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[REIGN FINAL – Reign 8, Canucks 2 – Sturm, Tynan, Grans - LA Kings Insider]]\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jared Shafran]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[T.J.

I think we didn’t \\[feel good] at the start. We were up 3-2 five minutes in but it was much too open. It’s the first game, I know everyone was excited and everyone wanted to get going, but after that we decided to gamble and started to play to our identity and came up with big goals. Overall, it was a big team effort today. Even after bad, ugly hits, guys stepped up. Even skilled guys like Lias \\[Andersson] and \\[Jacob Moverare]. It was good to see.\n\n\u003e It always helps when you get the guys back, especially the first unit. They know each other really well, so they know where to be and they support each other really well. They’re threats all over the place. It starts on the point with Spence, and then goes down to the flank. Kupari was a nice addition in the middle. There were lots of good things with the other units as well. Special teams will be very important down the stretch because there will be a lot of penalties to kill as well.\n\n\u003e I think he’s our best player, and on a lot of teams, the best players are captain. That’s why we named him captain, but we believe in him too. I think he also has to grow and learn how to be a captain as well. He’s up for the challenge. He’s working on it every day, and that’s what we like. He showed it today. The guys love him. He brings a lot to the team and the guys will stick up for him.\n\n\u003e He’s really good. He’s a good goalie but an even better person. His work ethic is one of the best I’ve seen from a goalie and I know the guys like him. He played big tonight. He stopped a few breakaways at the right time, and that’s what we need. I think every team wants a good goalie and I think we have one with him and Matthew Villalta. It was nice to see him with a big one tonight.\n\n\u003e I was surprised today too. Playing in the NHL, he probably wouldn’t try that move. It might work, yes, but if it doesn’t, then you’re probably in the doghouse. But here it was good for him. He tried it and ended up with a really nice highlight goal. When you play defense, everything is quick, so he doesn’t have that many touches in a game. It was nice to see him makes some plays and score that goal. Overall, I think he played really well. He was just a very good presence on the ice. All of those guys, especially the NHL guys, make a big difference.\n\n### [[T.J. Tynan]]\n\u003e Honestly, I don’t think we started very well. I think we found our game as it went on and obviously we have a lot of talent in that room. It was kind of a sloppy night but we’ll get better. We’ll take 8 goals, obviously, and the two points, so we’ll keep going from there.\n\n\u003e It was great. Obviously the most important thing is winning and that’s what we did. Brett Sutter was here for a long time. Those are big shoes that I’ll probably never fill. He was an amazing player, person, and teammate. He’s the best ever. For me, it’s just about being myself. I’ve got a lot of support in that room with the older guys and younger guys. We have a tight-knit group. It’s obviously an honor but the two points are what matters, and that’s what we got tonight.\n\n\u003e It’s been a treat. He’s been awesome. Every day, you’re going to work. He’s been there and he’s done it, so he knows. He’s somebody that you can pick his brain. He’s a good teacher and as players, that’s what you want. You want honest, you want to learn, and that’s what we’re going to do this year. We’re going to get better each day and that’s something everyone’s excited to see.\n\n\u003e You’re not going to find me complaining, right? He’s unbelievable. You can see it. I think everyone in the building can see it. I just think he’s incredible. Obviously, its nice. Last year, guys stepped up when he wasn’t here, but having him back tonight, he showed what an incredible talent he is.\n\n\u003e They make it easy, right? They’re amazing players and its good to see them get on the board early. For me, it’s just about using my skill set to try to get them pucks where they’re comfortable and where they like it. You get Lias the puck around the net and good things are going to happen. I actually missed Sammy a couple of times today, but if you can get him some pucks, he’s got a heck of a shot. We were okay tonight, obviously we scored a couple goals, but hopefully we get better and better each day.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.74638256Z","tags":null},"/REIGN-PRESEASON-FINAL-Reign-2-Gulls-6-Sturm-Ward":{"title":"REIGN PRESEASON FINAL – Reign 2, Gulls 6 – Sturm, Ward","content":"\n# REIGN PRESEASON FINAL – Reign 2, Gulls 6 – Sturm, Ward\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n 2022-10-08   | [[LA Kings Insider]]  | [REIGN PRESEASON FINAL – Reign 2, Gulls 6 – Sturm, Ward](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/08/reign-preseason-final-reign-2-gulls-6-sturm-ward/)\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jared Shafran]]\n\n## Players\n- [[Taylor Ward]]\n\n## Summary\n\u003e In their only game of the 2022 preseason, one that was filled with special teams, the Ontario Reign fell short to the San Diego Gulls by a final score of 6-2 Saturday night at Pechanga Arena. Rookie forwards Martin Chromiak and Taylor Ward scored the tallies for Ontario, while goaltender Matt Villalta started the game and made 18 saves on 19 shots in just over 31 minutes of action.\n\n## Notes\n### [[Marco Sturm]]\n\u003e Going into a game like this, some guys have never even played a game yet. You want to try to get your legs going. You try to do the stuff we worked on all week and try to be the best player you can be. I think there’s a lot of guys who showed me and the coaching staff what they can do what they can bring for the team.\n\n\u003e Well, we got scored on twice on our power play and we got two or three goals against on the penalty kill, so that has to be fixed, but lots of different guys in lots of different positions today. I think there’s some areas today we have to work on. I think there’s some guys in this locker room, who will be here, who have to be better too. The season starts in a week. There’s a short turnaround and I think the guys have been going hard all week long. They deserve to have a day off tomorrow and then regroup and try to be better on Monday.\n\n\u003e There’s a few things that I think are in our control and I think the mistakes we made, especially the first 45 minutes, everything was on our tape. We’ve got to keep things simple first. I think everyone has to know their role on the team. You don’t have to do anything special. We’ve just got to play hard, play for the team, be a good teammate, and win some hockey games.\n\n\u003e I know we have a lot of toughness on our team, but I’m not looking at that. I want to play hockey. Yes, this is a big part of our team and our game, but at the end of the day, I just didn’t like the way we played. I think we had a good start and first 10 minutes, but in the end San Diego was just better than us. I think we still had enough good players in our lineup, but again, it was a good lesson for all of us. I’ll just have to make sure it’s not going to happen again.\n\n### [[Taylor Ward]]\n\u003e ","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.74638256Z","tags":null},"/REIGN-PREVIEW-Ontario-at-Colorado-11-3-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"REIGN PREVIEW – Ontario at Colorado, 11-3 - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# REIGN PREVIEW – Ontario at Colorado, 11-3 - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                          |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-11-03 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [REIGN PREVIEW – Ontario at Colorado, 11-3 - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/11/03/reign-preview-ontario-at-colorado-11-3/) |\n| 2022-11-03 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[REIGN PREVIEW – Ontario at Colorado, 11-3 - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                              |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jared Shafran]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Ontario Reign play outside of California for the first time this season Thursday night to open a two-game series in Colorado against the Eagles.

Unfortunately, last year, having been diagnosed with mono right before training camp, we really didn’t get to see him. Then, we brought him out \\[to LA] after the Barrie Colts were eliminated in the playoffs, but he had a knee injury that required surgery; that kept him out. So, we never really had a hands-on view of him, by any means. \\[There were] lots of expectations when he came into camp and lived up to it. He’s fit in. I think one of the big things going forward was the way he played – very creative, very deceptive. But what we wanted to make sure – ‘Is he going to compete hard enough? Was he going to be coachable? Was he going to listen to what Trent Yawney and Todd McLellan were preaching? Would he buy into the system?’ And that’s been way above, I think, any expectations any of us had on him. So, he’s earned his chance.\n\n\u003e It’s still a situation that’s going to evolve here. We have to make sure that when he’s in the lineup that he’s getting the reasonable amount of minutes to keep developing. If you look, a lot of it will probably rely on Trent Yawney and just his previous experiences with young D in the other organizations he’s been in, and how he’s been able to take them and get them minutes. He talks about it all the time, ‘Listen, he’s as good as some of the players in the NHL at making plays, he’s deceptive, he can show that he can be there. We just have to make sure we’re continually getting him the minutes that will help him develop. It’s an ongoing situation. The first step was getting through training camp and he’s going to get his reps here during the regular season now.\n\n\u003e I don’t know if we have anything in concrete right now. There are a couple things that go \\[into it]. We have to get Sean Walker and Sean Durzi up to speed with their injury. … Those injuries were long-term, and especially Walker’s situation. So, he’s going to have to get his reps and everything in there. Getting Brandt into the lineup will be the first step, then managing his minutes and seeing how the games go, and the pace of the regular season. There is a big difference between training camp, preseason games, and the regular season. We’ll have to monitor it. I don’t think we have a plan set in place. We’re fortunate, \\[not only] with [[Trent Yawney]], but also with \\[new assistant coach] [[Jim Hiller]]. He went through this with the Islanders, with a young defenseman in Noah Dobson. I think it was his 19-year-old year in the NHL; just with how they used him early on until he got into the lineup. We’re going have to use some of those experiences.\n\n\u003e ","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.750382679Z","tags":null},"/Royal-Succession-Vegas-Seattle-Minnesota":{"title":"Royal Succession - Vegas, Seattle, Minnesota","content":"\n# Royal Succession - Vegas, Seattle, Minnesota\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-11 | [[The Forum Report]] | [Royal Succession - Vegas, Seattle, Minnesota](https://theforumreport.com/2022/10/11/royal-succession-vegas-seattle-minnesota/)\n2022-10-11 | [[The Forum Report]] | [[Royal Succession - Vegas, Seattle, Minnesota]]\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jon Rosen]]\n\n\n## Players\n- \n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Like Jazz Room, another new feature!

As a free agent coming out of college after spending four seasons at the University of Nebraska-Omaha, Ward chose to begin his pro career with the Kings, agreeing to a one-year entry level deal on March 19.\n\n## Notes\n\u003e I was on the phone a lot; I was doing a bunch of research and getting as much information as I could on what I wanted to do next and I had the opportunity to speak with pretty much everybody in this organization. I just loved what I heard from everyone and their emphasis on development so it just felt like the right fit and it’s a tough place to say no to so I didn’t. -- [[Taylor Ward]]\n\n\u003e I was thrown in there at the end of last season and into the playoffs, which actually helped me become pretty comfortable with the guys pretty quickly last year. -- [[Taylor Ward]]\n\n\u003e To be able to spend the summer here with a handful of Kings guys that I got to really watch and learn from, it was really cool. And now to be able to see those guys at the rink every day and feel comfortable, I’m enjoying it. I feel like it’s made my first few days here at rookie camp a lot easier, rather than just coming in without knowing anybody so I’m glad I did it and it was a great experience. -- [[Taylor Ward]]\n\n\u003e I felt pretty good there in the first game. It was the first game of my season and moving up there playing with Q and Madds, I thought we played well and we were creating offense. Obviously that’s more fun than playing in the D zone so that’s what we like to do. The coaches expressed that they were happy with how I was playing so that’s always good to hear as well. -- [[Taylor Ward]]\n\n\u003e “I didn’t really know him, but I’m very pleased. The way he plays, he reminds me of a few players I played with, so I think there’s something to it and he’s been really good, he’s a pleasant surprise. We’re going to try to keep pushing him to get more out of him, but so far, he’s had a really good tournament. -- [[Marco Sturm]] on [[Taylor Ward]]\n\n\u003e He just brings such a presence and he’s a very smart man. Anytime he opens his mouth, I’m trying to learn as much as possible, listen, and then apply what he’s saying to my game. The first few days have been great so far and I think everybody in the room is a big fan of his so I’m excited to keep playing for him. -- [[Taylor Ward]] on [[Marco Sturm]]\n\n\u003e It’s been really fun so far. I’ve never been at a rookie camp or anything like it before so I’m having fun with it. It’s cool to see some of your buddies on the other teams and obviously getting out there and putting on a Kings uniform is something special no matter where or when you’re doing it. -- [[Taylor Ward]]\n\n\u003e I didn’t want to come into my first main camp with no idea of what to expect and not knowing many people. So now to be able to come into camp and feel much more comfortable with the guys that are in the locker room and the coaching staff, training staff and everybody around, it’s definitely a big help for sure. I think I’d be much more nervous if I was back home the whole summer. -- [[Taylor Ward]]\n\n\u003e We’ve got some really smart guys up there in the gym in LA and the things we did were actually pretty interesting and very helpful.

Scouts and evaluators often fall prey to lazily characterizing young prospects in this way: the power forward, the two-way centre, the speedy winger, the one-dimensional scorer, the elusive European, the stay-at-home defenceman. But sometimes, just sometimes, there’s a player who is so uniquely different from everyone else in approach or in ability that you can’t help but notice him. These players have mastered their skill and used it to set themselves apart. The Gifted is a 10-part series which examines through video the NHL’s most fascinating prospects and the unique skillsets that define them.\n\n\n## Players\n- Miro Heiskanen\n- Casey Mittelstadt\n- Dylan Strome\n- Oliver Wahlstrom\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- Adam Boqvist\n- Evan Bouchard\n- Kristian Vesalainen\n- Jonathan Dahlen\n- Morgan Frost\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.750382679Z","tags":null},"/The-Hockey-News":{"title":"The Hockey News","content":"\n# The Hockey News\n\n| URL          | Feed     | Twitter                                |\n| ------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------- |\n| [Homepage]() | [Feed]() | [@twitterHandle](https://twitter.com/) | \n\n\n## Articles\n| Title | Source Link | Date Published |\n| ----- | ----------- | -------------- |\n|       |             |                |\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.750382679Z","tags":null},"/The-Hockey-Tactics-Newsletter":{"title":"The Hockey Tactics Newsletter","content":"\n# The Hockey Tactics Newsletter\n\n| URL          | Feed     | Twitter                                |\n| ------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------- |\n| [They Hockey Tactics Newsletter](https://jhanhky.substack.com/) | [Feed]() | [@twitterHandle](https://twitter.com/) | \n\n\n## Articles\n| Title | Source Link | Date Published |\n| ----- | ----------- | -------------- |\n| 2022-05-11 | [[The Hockey Tactics Newsletter]] | [[Playoff Playbook - LAKs Counter-Offensive]]                                                                       |\n| 2022-05-03 | [[The Hockey Tactics Newsletter]] | [[Playoff Playbook - Wingback Activation]] |\n| 2022-02-26 | [[The Hockey Tactics Newsletter]] | [[How LAK Creates Offense]] |\n| 2021-10-09 | [[The Hockey Tactics Newsletter]] | [[LAK - Rebuilding to Contend]]                                                         |\n| 2021-10-06 | [[The Hockey Tactics Newsletter]] | [[System Sheets - LAK 2021]]                                                                                  |\n| 2020-06-26 | [[The Hockey Tactics Newsletter]] | [[A Development Plan for Quinton Byfield]] | \n| 2020-05-29 | [[The Hockey Tactics Newsletter]] | [[How will Byfield answer The Question]]                                                                                                            |\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.750382679Z","tags":null},"/The-Hockey-Writers":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.750382679Z","tags":null},"/The-Lines-They-Are-A-Changing......Kings-display-new-look-heading-into-tomorrows-game-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"The Lines They Are A-Changing......Kings display new look heading into tomorrows game - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# The Lines They Are A-Changing......Kings display new look heading into tomorrows game - LA Kings Insider\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-28 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [The Lines They Are A-Changing......Kings display new look heading into tomorrows game - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/28/the-lines-they-are-a-changing-kings-display-new-look-heading-into-tomorrows-game/) |\n| 2022-10-28 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [[The Lines They Are A-Changing......Kings display new look heading into tomorrows game - LA Kings Insider]]                                                                                                                        |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The t̶i̶m̶e̶s̶ lines, they are a-changing, Insiders.\n\u003e If last night’s promotion was Grateful Dead night as the Kings hosted Winnipeg then consider this morning’s practice to be Bob Dylan Day. Changes were certainly alluded during yesterday’s post-game press conference and we certainly got a few this morning as the Kings prepare to host Toronto tomorrow evening.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n- [[Jaret Anderson-Dolan]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e Well, I think that Kevin and Gabe have a lot of similarities, they create, they have good vision and they can set people up. Right handed shot \\[versus] left handed shot, that often makes a big difference. Kopi’s line, and I’m not putting this all on Kevin by any means, has been out-chanced in the majority of the games they’ve played and we can’t keep going that route. Gabe will play there tomorrow and I think Gabe can make some of the plays that Kevin makes as well, but we can try and stabilize lines and maybe it’ll help Kevin with some other linemates as well.\n\n\u003e Potentially. Kevin’s made some pretty good hockey plays. Juice has had a couple breakaways from the hashmarks in because of plays that Kevin made. In the offensive zone, we brought him here to be creative and to be an offensive player and with those players, there’s going to be some risk. It’s what that line is doing outside the blue line, neutral zone, d-zone that has to be a little bit better. That’s not on Fiala completely, it’s the whole group on the ice.\n\n### [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n\u003e Not much changes for me, I’m going to still play the same way, try to play the same way. Two different guys with different skillsets, I guess, that will take some adjusting but I’ve played a little bit with them now, when we’ve mixed some things up at the end of games. Obviously Kopi is a playmaker, a big body, he’s going to protect pucks and Juice has a wicked shot. I’m just going to play my game and see what happens.\n\n### [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\u003e His skill is through the roof. He’s got to be towards the top of the league in handling the puck in tight spaces. He’s displayed it and he very rarely loses the a stick battle. I knew the skill was always there and his hockey IQ is exceptional. He’s had a couple of bad years with injuries and we always talk about confidence, which couldn’t have been very high, but he came to camp with a mission. He’s been our best player.\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.750382679Z","tags":null},"/Things-looking-up-for-Kings-ahead-of-Jets-matchup":{"title":"Things looking up for Kings ahead of Jets matchup","content":"\n# Things looking up for Kings ahead of Jets matchup\n\n| Date       | Site                  | Link                                                                                                                                     |\n| ---------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-26 | [[Field Level Media]] | [Things looking up for Kings ahead of Jets matchup](https://fieldlevelmedia.com/news/things-looking-up-for-kings-ahead-of-jets-matchup/) |\n| 2022-10-26 | [[Field Level Media]] | [[Things looking up for Kings ahead of Jets matchup]]                                                                                    |\n\n## Contributors\n- \n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Los Angeles Kings coach Todd McLellan is beginning to like what he sees from his team.

Contributors\n- \n\n\n## Players\n- \n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Todd McLellan talks to the media ahead of a preseason matchup vs the Anaheim Ducks\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e is there a number that you'd like to see\nthe full group play together or is it\nmore about the music people well as we\nget we've got four left and play every\nsecond night\num we're still trying to evaluate some\nof the question marks they need to\ncontinue to play but we have to make\nsure now that the team is up and running\nand by the end of the training camp the\nveterans should all have three to four\ngames for sure\num\nmaybe not quite today but moving forward\nyou'd like to see all your units\ntogether at one point\nuh pairs using uh they're playing with\neach other on the penalty kill I think\nthat's important but we still got a game\nor two here to evaluate and try and give\nopportunity to some and um\nevery player has a lifeline and\nsome players have extended there's\nothers it's shrunk on them but this is\nthe week\ndoes venue play a role in the preseason\nor as a first game first preseason game\nof crypto because that did teach you\nanything uh it doesn't necessarily help\nteach I don't think but\nuh a common theme around the league as\nyou dress a few more veterans\num at home you don't have to travel\nalone\nto wherever you're going\num and they play big big minutes during\nthe year\nalleviate travel I think you're seeing\nthat so tenancy is that the home team\nat points has a stronger lineup or more\nveteran type lineup because that's where\nyou want to play those individuals and\nRogue team tends to be a little younger\nor\nguys that haven't played quite as much\nor won't play as much during the year so\nI I think that's a tendency around the\nleague\num that's what we're seeing again this\nyear\nit's not the big night for Sean Walker\nyou can actually kind of get back into\nit here with whatever maybe not\nnecessarily Sean but speaking from a\ngeneral standpoint\nis there a trade a trait about\nyou you said you refer to him as someone\nthat kind of has had a pitbull\nfor players like him those are a move\nundrafted those have maybe been whole\nis there something about them in\nparticular that\nI don't know really drives them\nwhatsoever that that's okay yeah this is\na good question and a good observation\nso um obviously walks and and we talked\nabout\nI think about a week ago 10 days ago\nabout the undrafted players that have\nbeen able to come through here playing\nand these are the ones that have stuck\nwith it and committed and bullied their\nway into teams lineups\num there's a whole bunch that haven't\ndone that but the ones that have\num have that\nconstitutiveness that determination\nI'm going to prove you wrong every night\nand if you tell me I can't I'll show you\nI can\nmentality and when you look at the mazat\nWalker\nifollo those types of players they play\nthat way I think most nights they're\npersonal makeup reflects their fight to\nget into the league and stay in the\nleague and they they play that way and\nthat's probably why I use the word\npitbull with with Locker there's a scent\nmaybe a little not to compare but do you\nsee where there's a little bit of more\nof a sense where it's like you can't\ntake things for granted the the\nentitlements used in our society\neverywhere not not in just in the LA\nKings locker room or in the NHL it's all\nit's all over the place\num\nand those individuals are not entitled\nthey don't feel like they've been given\nanything they've had to fight and\ncontinue to prove\nsometimes at the other end of the scale\npeople will look and say well they've\nbeen given everything and they've been\nentitled in nine lives type scenario for\ndifferent individuals under different\ncircumstances but the whole group that\nwe're talking about zero entitlement\nso if you look at a guy over on his\noffside from a coaching standpoint where\nwhere do you like what concerns do you\nhave well for a guy like what he can or\ncannot do a planning options\nit's I think it's individual\num comfort\nwhen you do that some cans some can't\nand for a whole bunch of different\nreasons based on the individual the the\npivot the ability to see things uh\ngetting around the puck to shoot it\num confidence to play over there and\nthere is there isn't a single variable\nthat that they all fall into it's\ndifferent for everyone\num\nAlex said there's played in the league\nfor\nhowever long he's played I don't know 15\n16 years\nhe feels good over there he just goes\nand stands over that's what he does so\nhis ability to change now would be\nharder than something that hasn't done\nit there's another variable\nso your your questions a good one but I\ncan't answer it\nspecifically because I think every demon\ntakes on different\nthese different variables that come into\nplay there\nyou mentioned\nyou hold the equipment I'm obviously you\ngot sick right now but what do you need\nto see from him to make that a reality\nwhat does he need to earn that extra ice\ntime\nwell he's got a Beat\num some other centermen we're going to\nplay in the center he's going to be take\nice time away from those other\nindividuals it's a tough task on our\nteam when you look at copy and you look\nat what Phil does and how hard lizzo\nplays and the the effect he had so uh\nanyway you cut it there's 60 Minutes a\nnight certain games roll out with power\nplays and penalty kills but at the end\nof the day you've got to start grabbing\nminutes from other people\nso his minutes could go up and down\nbased on others performances but he's\nalso responsible for his own and we\nexpect\nthere's that word expectations our\ninternal expectations are realistic\nthey're\num\nattainable\ntheir\nteam orientated but also individual\ndriven and our expectations for cues\nhave taken the next step physically on\nthe ice stain the models a little bit\nmore I haven't seen the blocked off\npucks very much this year which is\nalready a good sign\nthe ability to make plays a little bit\nquicker more production offensively he's\ngot great instincts and stuff can you\nget more out of that is he responsible\ndefensively does this\nFace-Off numbers go way up and we've\nseen that already in the exhibition\nseason so\nhe's already taking steps to more ice\ntime\nbut the way the game rolls out and what\nthe others are doing also affects how\nyou use people what's the likelihood of\nuh being able to get Jersey and\nsometimes later uh we're hoping to do\nthat and potentially already depending\non how\nyou know RV would likely be that last\ngame if he's going to play it all durers\nwe really believe we can get him in a\ngame or two even this week\nwith Thursday and a lot coming back\nbecause I make it more difficult to get\nsome of your Brent carp has had a good\namount of campaign in the lineup and how\ndo you kind of deal with that situation\ndifficult decisions are good ones for us\nand yeah getting Jersey back and watch\nback is is great for our team the fact\nthat the the kid is really pushing and\ndoing some good things is another bonus\nfor all of us\num it'll be they'll sort themselves out\nas time goes on\num\neverybody's at a different\njuncture in their careers uh Alexander\nis not going to play in Ontario who's\ngoing to play on our team uh Brian Clark\nhas two options he can play here go back\nto Junior there's some that are waiver\nbowl that buy us time there's other guys\nwe have to think about for waivers\nthere's so many factors that come in and\nwhat we look like on day one on the blue\nline\nmight not be what we look like on day\ntwo it can vary from day to day and not\neven based on injury just performance\nand\nbusiness\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.750382679Z","tags":null},"/Toews-Soderblom-help-Blackhawks-defeat-Kings-in-OT":{"title":"Toews, Soderblom help Blackhawks defeat

McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e We talked about fixing some things after the Dallas game (a 5-2 loss on Tuesday). We saw it today. \\[We] did a real good job of it, gave up very few outnumbered rushes. We were pretty solid defensively, good through the neutral zone. We did a lot of things well tonight. We didn't get the win. Sometimes bounces go against you, and that's what happened to \\[Fiala] in front of the net. I didn't think we had as much polish as we've shown offensively.\n\n### [[Blake Lizotte]]\n\u003e I think as of late my line specifically has been struggling on the defensive end of it. Our focus now is just playing simple, smart hockey. When you can get pucks to go in, it's always nice.\n\u003e We kind of started the year scoring a lot but also giving up a lot. I think our team is starting to turn around where we play a little more defensive hockey, which I think most Kings fans are used to and most Kings players are used to. I think that's actually a good sign for us, that we're in these 1-1 games versus 6-5 shootouts. I think it's more our style and what our identity is and what we want to be.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.750382679Z","tags":null},"/Tony-Ferrari":{"title":"Tony Ferrari","content":"\n# Tony Ferrari\n\n| NHL.com | Twitter |\n| ------- | ------- |\n| [Tony Ferrari]() | [@twitter_handle](https://twitter.com/)\n\n| Title | Organization |\n| ----- | ------------ |\n|       |              |\n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\n| Date | Title |\n| ---- | ----- |\n|      |       |\n\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\n| Date | Title |\n| ---- | ----- |\n|      |       |\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.750382679Z","tags":null},"/Top-10-Questions-at-Training-Camp-Rookie-Face-Off-Recap":{"title":"Top 10 Questions at Training Camp \u0026 Rookie Face-Off Recap","content":"\n# Top 10 Questions at Training Camp \u0026 Rookie Face-Off Recap\n\n| Link | Date Published | Sequence | Length|\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [Top 10 Questions at Training Camp \u0026 Rookie Face-Off Recap](https://all-the-kings-men.simplecast.com/episodes/top-10-questions-at-training-camp-rookie-faceoff-recap-yySg7qQ5)  | 2022-09-22 | S09:E03 | 01:24:33 |\n\n## Contributors:\n- [[Jack Jablonski]]\n- [[Daryl Evans]]\n- [[Jesse Cohen]]\n- [[Jared Shafran]]\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- \n\n## Summary\n\"Daryl Evans and Jared Shafran join host Jesse Cohen to recap the recently completed three game showing at the Rookie Faceoff in San Jose. the pair discuss which players stood out, how the coaching staff handled the short exhibition and which players are expected to build on their momentum at Kings training camp.

He was on-track and doing well in the summer, but then had a setback \\[and wasn’t able to participate at Development Camp]. So we’re dealing with that. He’s currently in a stage of his rehab where he’s skating on his own. Progressing from that point, we have some medical appointments next week for him. If everything goes as planned, and the way it’s directed, he’ll soon start working his way back into a non-contact spot at practice. Then, we’ll go from there. It’s a difficult situation for him and for us, but we have to put his health first. I know we all want to \\[see him back playing], but he has to be healthy with himself and be in that situation before he can get back on the ice. -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.750382679Z","tags":null},"/Vegas-scores-late-to-edge-Kings-in-season-opener":{"title":"Vegas scores late to edge Kings in season opener","content":"\n# Vegas scores late to edge Kings in season opener\n\n| Date       | Site              | Link                                                                                                                                           |\n| ---------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-11 | [[LA Daily News]] | [Vegas scores late to edge Kings in season opener](https://www.dailynews.com/2022/10/11/las-vegas-scores-late-to-edge-kings-in-season-opener/) |\n| 2022-10-11 | [[LA Daily News]] | [[Vegas scores late to edge Kings in season opener]]                                                                                           |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Andrew Knoll]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e A critical error in the final minute allowed the game-winning goal with 24.9 seconds left.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Sean Durzi]]\n- [[Jonathan Quick]]\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Todd McLellan]]\n\u003e We got an outstanding effort by our goaltender and we still had a chance to win, we had a chance at a point, really.\n\n\u003e The focus will be on the play at the end.

You can probably see where this is going.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.750382679Z","tags":null},"/Waking-up-with-the-Kings-October-16":{"title":"Waking up with the Kings - October 16","content":"\n# Waking up with the Kings - October 16\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                     |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[The Forum Report]] | [Waking up with the Kings - October 16](https://theforumreport.com/waking-up-with-the-kings-october-16/) |\n| 2022-10-16 | [[The Forum Report]] | [[Waking up with the Kings - October 16]]                                                                |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jon Rosen]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Gabe Vilardi]]\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n- [[Matt Roy]]\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n- [[Cal Petersen]]\n- [[Phillip Danault]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Kings and Wild’s competitive cycles last decade overlapped somewhat, and even if Minnesota couldn’t match Los Angeles’ blossoming superstardom or postseason success, they were an upper-echelon team in a difficult division whose traditional structure and collective buy-in made teams play their way – often to their opponents’ demise. Like Nashville, or L.A., St. Paul wasn’t the best place to go when trying to figure your game out, and while the National Hockey League provides such incredible theatre every night, defensively sharp Kings-Wild games often made you squint to find it. But it is not 2013 anymore, and the series’ sluggardly yesteryear was finally and mercifully laid to rest by a 13-goal, 1980’s-style game where Los Angeles won all the momentum swings and received tantalizing performances from several players whose importance to the organization is much broader than their stat line on a Saturday in October.\n\n\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003eI don’t know that \\[the offense] will increase, but I do believe \\[last year’s surge] will remain the same because the amount of talent coming into the league is immense. Teams are built differently now than they were even five, six, seven years ago. -- [[Todd McLellan]] \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.750382679Z","tags":null},"/Waking-up-with-the-Kings-October-18":{"title":"Waking up with the Kings - October 18","content":"\n# Waking up with the Kings - October 18\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                     |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-18 | [[The Forum Report]] | [Waking up with the Kings - October 18](https://theforumreport.com/waking-up-with-the-kings-october-18/) |\n| 2022-10-18 | [[The Forum Report]] | [[Waking up with the Kings - October 18]]                                                                |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jon Rosen]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Retrospective on the previous night's game in Detroit and with [[Alex Edler]] out with an injury,a reminder that the Kings are overloaded on right-handed defensemen.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Viktor Arvidsson]]\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n- [[Alex Edler]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.750382679Z","tags":null},"/Waking-up-with-the-Kings-October-19":{"title":"Waking up with the Kings - October 19","content":"\n# Waking up with the Kings - October 19\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                     |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-19 | [[The Forum Report]] | [Waking up with the Kings - October 19](https://theforumreport.com/waking-up-with-the-kings-october-19/) | \n| 2022-10-19 | [[The Forum Report]] | [[Waking up with the Kings - October 19]]                                                                |\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jon Rosen]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Head Coach Todd McLellan has challenged the LA Kings to recreate their identity, a process that can vex teams to recently experience their first taste of success.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Cal Petersen]]\n- [[Matt Roy]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e It would have been really easy on a back-to-back to just back it in and count it as a loss.

The fourth man on the rush, it’s a good look offensively. But there comes a responsibility with it as well. You can’t just jump up whenever you want. You’ve got to pick your spots and be responsible defensively. -- [[Matt Roy]]\n\n\u003e He has some confidence now. Our D has been in flex a little bit trying to find steady partners, but I think that’s in Matt’s game. He’s shown that in the past and it came out tonight. I’m sure there’ll be other games this year we’ll see it again. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n \n\u003e I had a few guys mention number three \\[in the shootout rotation], but we all saw our D take shots in exhibition season and they’re a little ways down the line. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.750382679Z","tags":null},"/Waking-up-with-the-Kings-October-21":{"title":"Waking up with the Kings - October 21","content":"\n# Waking up with the Kings - October 21\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                     |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-21 | [[The Forum Report]] | [Waking up with the Kings - October 21](https://theforumreport.com/waking-up-with-the-kings-october-21/) |\n| 2022-10-21 | [[The Forum Report]] | [[Waking up with the Kings - October 21]]                                                                |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jon Rosen]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e Own the first period, dominate possession, generate long in-zone shifts, allow three goals, load up the bus.

Apologies for the tangent and feel free to continue to the next paragraph. But as LAKI and The Forum Report evolved so slowly into soccer blogs that it was hard for the untrained eye to notice, last night’s game was the perfect example of a Football Manager game where you rested all your starters and were locked in a scoreless draw with Grimsby Town in the 84th minute of a Carabao Cup game in which your xGF is three goals better than theirs and the simulation quickly cuts to a highlight in which your team doesn’t have the ball. This esoterica has spawned memes, and for those of us who’ve spent months of our lives losing players to Paris St. Germain and combing Argentina for 16-year-old wunderkids, the Jets scoring the first goal after early Kings domination was all too familiar.\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n- [[Jonathan Quick]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.750382679Z","tags":null},"/Waking-up-with-the-Kings-October-30":{"title":"Waking up with the Kings - October 30","content":"\n# Waking up with the Kings - October 30\n\n| Date       | Site                 | Link                                                                                                     |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-30 | [[The Forum Report]] | [Waking up with the Kings - October 30](https://theforumreport.com/waking-up-with-the-kings-october-30/) |\n| 2022-10-30 | [[The Forum Report]] | [[Waking up with the Kings - October 30]]                                                                |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Jon Rosen]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The LA Kings tuned up several important parts of their operation in a performance that improved as 60 minutes elapsed and represented the game-over-game response anyone in hockey operations would want to see after the bad taste left over from the Winnipeg game, limiting one of the league’s premier offensive teams to just one five-on-five goal.

He lost a lot of weight, he’s going to need to get strong again. He’ll need some time to recover.\n\n\u003e  I’d like to do that with Iafallo, anybody that’s out. Sammy Fagemo in the minors. Turcotte in the minors. We want to get all of them up to speed, because they’re all important players. Q’s no different than anybody else. He needs energy, he needs strength, he’s got to feel good about himself.\n\n\u003e I don’t think anybody should lose their spot to injury or illness. It’s out of your control. Usually you lose your spot in the lineup based on different play. So, we’ll see once everybody gets \\[back]. There’s no decision that has to be made right now based on Quinton or Ras or anybody else in our lineup because he’s not ready to play.\n\n\u003e He’s got tremendous legs, and the ability to drive the puck to the net, or even drive deep into lanes. There’s a little more confidence in more situations. \\[more opportunity for him to use his]  give-go game. ‘You’re quick, you have good legs, dish it and jump to a hole. Find that hole.’ Some of it’s experience or instincts.\n\n\u003e Some of them went home and still couldn’t sleep. You wake up, your sleep pattern’s broken, you jump in a car, it was cold the other night, everybody was wide awake, and you’re not getting ‘til bed until 3:30.\n\n\u003e A lot of times the coaching staff just sits in the locker room and we’ll go through our lineup and we’ll put arrows \\[next to names]. ‘Adrian Kempe, up, flat or down? One of the three, where he’s at?’ And if you get too many down errors, you’re in trouble.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.754382797Z","tags":null},"/Where-Are-They-Now-The-Historic-2019-USA-NTDP-Squad":{"title":"Where Are They Now - The Historic 2019 USA NTDP Squad","content":"\n# Where Are They Now - The Historic 2019 USA NTDP Squad\n\n| Date       | Site                | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| ---------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 2022-10-22 | [[The Hockey News]] | [Where Are They Now - The Historic 2019 USA NTDP Squad](https://thehockeynews.com/news/where-are-they-now-the-historic-2019-usa-ntdp-squad#:~:text=early%20last%20season.-,ALEX%20TURCOTTE,-%2C%20C%2C%20LOS%20ANGELES) |\n| 2022-10-22 | [[The Hockey News]] | [[Where Are They Now - The Historic 2019 USA NTDP Squad]]                                                                                                                                                               |\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Tony Ferrari]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The 2019 USA Hockey National Team Development Program had 17 players drafted into the NHL.

A 7-3 October loss in St. Louis saw the Blues tally four power-play goals in one game and after a four-game road trip, the Kings sat barely over 50 percent on the penalty kill, which set a difficult hurdle to come back from.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e I know everybody looks at the standings and they go well, they’re 31st and what’s kind of interesting for me last year is that we got off to a terrible start and when you get tapped for four in one game, it’s hard to recover. No one wrote that they jumped from 31st to 22nd at the end of the year and that is pretty impressive, it’s a credit to them. It doesn’t happen all the time. -- [[Trent Yawney]]\n\n\u003e We’ve looked at in segments, you take a 20-game segment and look at how you’re doing as a unit. Obviously, that one game kind of wrecked everything we had, but if you block it off into different chunks, we had a good penalty kill at times throughout the rest of the year. As much as it’s a full number, there’s ups and downs, peaks and valleys. It’s trying to analyze how you’re doing in your 10, 20 game segments and kind of go from there. -- [[Mikey Anderson]]\n\n\u003e Honestly, shorthanded goals are like a cherry on top, that’s not really the standard. Yanwns has been preaching for the last couple of years that we want to be aggressive and we want to go chase down pucks and make it hard on their team. Shorthanded goals are a product of that, so I think that his structure gives you opportunities but keeping the puck out of the net is the most important. -- [[Trevor Moore]]\n\n\u003e If you take last year, I \\[remember] all of them, but they were turning points in some of those games. We did get bit a couple times thinking that we had a scoring opportunity that ended up in the back of our net, so you don’t want to coach the offense out of them on the PK but remind them that killing the penalty is the priority and anything after that is a bonus. Staying aggressive, that’s kind of our word, to just stay aggressive when the opportunity does provide itself whether it’s on the killing side, the defensive side or we get the offensive opportunity to take advantage of it. -- [[Trent Yawney]]\n\n\u003e Pretty much everyone’s back, so we have an idea of what we want to do. It’s kind of just going over it in the room again, talking about it and watching video, but until you go through it and kill some penalties, you’re just trying to get back into it and then find the right ways to do it. I think communication and trying to kind of readdress everything we’ve talked about the past couple years is key. -- [[Mikey Anderson]]\n\n\u003e We’re hoping to find some new players, guys that maybe you don’t think are going to be penalty killers. You put them in situations and they take advantage of an opportunity and when you’re not dressing your full lineup, you have that that option. Todd has tried to work some different guys through, who were here last year but haven’t really been put \\[on the PK] in a game situation. These exhibition games provide that and it’s good to see how they react in a practice versus a game because it is different. -- [[Trent Yawney]]\n\n\u003e We kind of dug ourselves a hole last year and it took us close to the whole season to try and come out of it. Our numbers weren’t really where we wanted them to be, so I think a goal of ours is to start off really well on the penalty kill. I take a lot of pride in that and I think boosting our numbers by at least a couple of percentage points is a good goal. -- [[Blake Lizotte]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.754382797Z","tags":null},"/With-a-fresh-slate-the-work-is-well-underway-when-it-comes-to-the-LA-Kings-power-play":{"title":"With a fresh slate, the work is well underway when it comes to the LA Kings power play","content":"\n# With a fresh slate, the work is well underway when it comes to the LA Kings power play\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-03 | [[LA Kings Insider]] |  [With a fresh slate, the work is well underway when it comes to the LA Kings power play](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/03/with-a-fresh-slate-the-work-is-well-underway-when-it-comes-to-the-la-kings-power-play/)\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n## Players\n- \n\n## Summary\n\u003e It’s the topic you’ve likely asked the most about this season. It’s one of the bigger storylines and questions entering the 2022-23 season. It’s the LA Kings power play.\n\n## Notes\n\u003e I’ll finish probably every comment on the power play by saying it’s in the works right now. It’s quite early in the season and a lot of teams penalty kills haven’t had the time to polish up at this point. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e People try to imitate what’s working and there are certain things that are working right now, certain looks that teams are trying to get to that work for them. Will it work for the LA Kings, we’re not sure yet, but we did study those things pretty early. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e Jimmy brought a fresh set of eyes to our video from last year. It wasn’t tainted with opinion or frustration or joy, whatever it might be on that on the happy side. It was just a new set of eyes and he shared a lot of thoughts and ideas with us, so we adopted some of those things. He’s been around some good players and good power plays. -- [[Todd McLellan]] on [[Jim Hiller]]\n\n\u003e People in new places, with new roles that may take some predictability away from what could or should happen. The types of pieces we’re still using are quite common, or the individual pieces are quite common, and they might be in different spots, that may play a different role within it, but it’s still quite early. A lot of its experimental, we hope to make it permanent, but we’ll see how it goes. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e We’ve talked a lot about players with different hands, left shots, right shots, where different people could be options. Throughout training camp, we’ve just been trying that out. If you look at Kopi, Juice and Kevin, they’re playing as a line, but all three are lefties, so they’re almost interchangeable in the spots they’re playing in on the power play. -- [[Jim Hiller]]\n\n\u003e Especially off of breakout, it’s not going to be perfect, you’re not always going to be able to just sprint to your position, you have to be able to play in the middle and on the flank. Especially between me and Kevin, I think we’re both pretty similar in those areas, on the bumper and on the flank, it’s going to be whoever else ends up there. -- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n\n\u003e You know, I think all of us, not just us two but all of us can interchange and I think that’s what good power plays do. You don’t have a spot, you see how it goes and fill in wherever you are and play from there. -- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n\u003e With the breakouts and stuff where you come in, if I’m not \\[in position], it takes 5-10 seconds for me to sprint to the other side and for others to get set up. It helps a lot I think, it’s a good thing to not have to be in specific spots all of the time. -- [[Adrian Kempe]]\n\n\u003e Everybody wants to be good on the power play, it’s important, especially end of the year and in the playoffs, because it can win you games. Special teams, both PK and power play are huge. -- [[Kevin Fiala]]\n\n\u003e There’s really no secret sauce to it, it’s just being able to execute, feel confident and feel good about it. Sometimes it’s just getting on a roll, you start to feel good. -- [[Jim Hiller]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.754382797Z","tags":null},"/With-a-spot-on-the-opening-night-roster-Brandt-Clarke-is-ready-to-seize-his-surreal-opportunity-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"With a spot on the opening night roster, Brandt Clarke is ready to seize his surreal opportunity - LA Kings Insider","content":"\n# With a spot on the opening night roster, Brandt Clarke is ready to seize his surreal opportunity - LA Kings Insider\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-10 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [With a spot on the opening night roster, Brandt Clarke is ready to seize his surreal opportunity - LA Kings Insider](https://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/10/with-a-spot-on-the-opening-night-roster-brandt-clarke-is-ready-to-seize-his-surreal-opportunity/)\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e As the LA Kings hit the ice for practice this morning, donning their chrome helmets in advance of tomorrow’s season opener, one, slightly legible number stood out amongst the rest.\n\u003e 92.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e I went with 92, 55 is my original number but obviously Q has that. My brother wears 92, so it’s cool that if we can both make the NHL, we’ll wear it together, and my birthday is also February 9, ninth day of the second month, so that works out well too. I also think it looks pretty sharp. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\u003e It’s surreal, it’s something I’ve been working for my entire life really, it’s been a goal of mine. I’ve really ramped it up since knowing this was real possibility. They’ve given a real opportunity to showcase myself and I think I took advantage of that, I’m just stoked to be here. This is a dream of mine. I love the players here, I love the staff here and I’m thrilled to be on this team. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\n\u003e Brandt knows who Brandt is, he knows what’s in his toolbox, in his toolkit. He hasn’t played with fear and what I mean by fear is not the physical part of it, it’s the fear of erring on the ice, he makes plays, the intense plays. He’s been very coachable throughout training camp. Potentially away from the Kings, I could see where that confidence or that swagger could be misread in other environments, where it could hurt him, but with us, not one bit. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e It comes down to making sure that when he does get the lineup, he’s going to get the right amount of minutes to keep developing. His play through rookie camp and training camp has put him to a level where we want to see him in the NHL and that kind of went into the decision process. Now, the step is to make sure that it keeps going that way and we’ll let that play out here for the first little while and probably have to reevaluate \\[later on]. -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\u003e I think he can play in all situations, including penalty kill, which can give you an opportunity to get the minutes needed to keep developing at the NHL level. Power play, obviously, you see the deception and his hockey IQ, but also defending, he’s good in a sense with his defending. He’ll have to learn to protect himself a little bit more, there are guys who are bigger and stronger at this level than in juniors. I think his all-around game, there are a lot of aspects that would allow a player when he does get in the lineup in the regular season to maintain those minutes that are going to help him progress. -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\u003e We’ve tried quite a few \\[players] over there, [[Sean Walker]]’s played there at times, I think we’ve got to get him comfortable coming back from the surgery before we experiment again with the left side. We saw [[Sean Durzi]] slide over there and make that transition really easy and we’ve used Clarke over there a couple of times. The availability to open up that left side within our defense can increase \\[the chances of] getting Brandt in the lineup and getting him the minutes he needs. -- [[Rob Blake]]\n\n\u003e You see the professional attitude around here, it’s really telling and if you want to stick here, you have to bring the same attitude every day in practices, games, workouts. It’s really been an eye opener how seriously everyone takes it, how determined everyone is here. I’ve tried to match that, I’ve had to bring my ‘A’ performance every single day because if not I’m going to fall behind and I wouldn’t be on this team right now. That’s something I’m pretty proud of with the consistency that I brought and I’m going to try to continue it. -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\n\u003e We’ll see what happens. Whether I’m in the press box or in the lineup, either way it’ll be pretty soon. I’m just really appreciative to be here and thrilled to be on this team.  -- [[Brandt Clarke]]\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.754382797Z","tags":null},"/With-offseason-shoulder-surgery-behind-him-Sean-Durzi-is-right-on-track-in-his-return-to-action":{"title":"With offseason shoulder surgery behind him, Sean Durzi is right on track in his return to action","content":"\n# With offseason shoulder surgery behind him, Sean Durzi is right on track in his return to action\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n2022-10-01 | [[LA Kings Insider]] | [With offseason shoulder surgery behind him, Sean Durzi is right on track in his return to action](http://lakingsinsider.com/2022/10/01/with-offseason-shoulder-surgery-behind-him-sean-durzi-is-right-on-track-in-his-return-to-action/)\n2022-10-01 | [[LA Kings Insider]] |  [[With offseason shoulder surgery behind him, Sean Durzi is right on track in his return to action]]\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Zach Dooley]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Sean Durzi]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- \n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e For the first time yesterday, the LA Kings were whole once again.\n\u003e As Viktor Arvidsson rejoined the main group at Toyota Sports Performance Center, the Kings finally had all expected members of the season-opening roster on the ice at once. Arvidsson was the last piece of the puzzle, joining the most recent add before him in defenseman Sean Durzi.\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n### [[Sean Durzi]]\n\u003e When I made the decision to kind of get it done and have to get it fixed, I knew the biggest thing I wanted to work on was kind of my speed and explosiveness. Talking to the people around me – the coaching staff, the trainers here – when it’s an upper body injury, you obviously have to take some time off but when I got back to it, I was able to do a lot of the explosive work. Maybe not kind of jack up my shoulders, but we have so many machines and there’s so much technology that I was able to kind of work on those kind of things.\n\n\u003e There was one back in juniors, kind of a nagging thing and I really didn’t know I needed surgery until like three weeks before the season, so I ended up missing a couple of weeks. Similar idea where I had to monitor my training with it, that one was probably a little bit worse because I didn’t know what it was at first, it was nagging. This one I got ahead of it right after the season, got it done and in the summer I had a good plan, a good team in place and just had to execute it.\n\n\u003e I’ve separated shoulders, but this is the first time I’ve come back from shoulder surgery, which is a little bit different,. Any upper-body injury, where you know you’re going feel it in contact, there’s always that hesitation but practicing at one-hundred percent and practicing with full contact with these guys up there, it gives me a little more confidence every single day. So \\[yesterday] was a really good day with contact in battle drills and things like that.\n\n\u003e Not quite, I don’t think I’m ready. It’s nice to be out of the red jersey and to kind of get into some contact today but it’s a process, taking bodies and things like that, but I’m progressing well and it shouldn’t keep me out long.\n\n\u003e It’s tough to know, but all I can say right now is I’m progressing well. The biggest thing is taking it day by day, I’ve been so patient with it, I’ve done a good job this summer and the people around me have done such a good job that I want to make sure I’m getting ready to go.\n\n\u003e Already, it feels better than it did last season, so that’s awesome. I’ve noticed it a lot in my shot, the way I can handle the puck, my movements out there. When I first got the surgery, then you progress and progress and then I got to that point where I was last season] and now it’s like I’m surpassing it and it’s really cool to see that. It makes it all worth it, makes patience worth it and to go out there hopefully feeling better than it was, it’s exciting.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.754382797Z","tags":null},"/Wolves-Quinton-Byfield-ready-for-big-year-ahead-of-2020-NHL-draft":{"title":"Wolves Quinton Byfield ready for big year ahead of 2020 NHL draft","content":"\n# Wolves Quinton Byfield ready for big year ahead of 2020 NHL draft\n\n| Date       | Site | Link                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| ---------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 2019-07-31 | [[Sportsnet]]     | [Wolves Quinton Byfield ready for big year ahead of 2020 NHL draft](https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/juniors/wolves-quinton-byfield-ready-big-year-ahead-2020-nhl-draft/) |\n| 2019-07-31 | [[Sportsnet]] | [[Wolves Quinton Byfield ready for big year ahead of 2020 NHL draft]]\n\n## Contributors\n- Canadian Press\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e The Canadian Hockey League and Ontario Hockey League rookie of the year this past season will likely model that bow tie on the Bell Centre stage in the first round of the draft.\n\n\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Cory Stillman]]\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n- Trains with [[Gary Roberts]]\n\n### [[Cory Stillman]]\n\u003e He’s a good player that’s only going to get better. There’s a high ceiling for Quinton.\n\u003e He has the possibility to play, because of his size, because of his strength, in the NHL at 18.\n\n\u003e When he played midget, he had the puck, and if he didn’t have it, he just went and got it.\n\u003e Early in the year, when he didn’t have the puck, he wanted to chase it. In junior hockey, if you’re out of position, someone’s going to make a pass to your guy.\n\u003e Once he realized he should slow down, wait for it, and then attack and go get the puck, he got back into having it more.\n\n\u003e Right at the start, if we were down a goal and we pulled the goalie, he went out and played on the back end to run plays off as a 16-year-old.\n\u003e As the season went on, and we got into playoffs, if their goalie was pulled, I had enough confidence that he could play in an odd-man situation to win the hockey game also.\n\n\u003e As big as Quinton is, his engine, his motor, his legs, he’s on all the time. For six-foot-five, he skates very well.\n\n### [[Quinton Byfield]]\n\u003e I haven’t been overseas. It would definitely be a special experience. It’s definitely an honour.\n\u003e When I was little, I always watched the world juniors. The under-17 and under-18 teams are stepping stones towards that. I would look up to all those guys.\n\n\u003e I started playing hockey when I was three or four. I really fell in love with the game playing house league hockey.\n\u003e When I was younger, on Saturday nights, I’d also go over to my opa and oma, my grandparents’ house, and watch the (Toronto) Maple Leafs play with my opa. That’s where I also fell in love with the game.\n\n\u003e \\[Martin St. Louis] was the smallest guy, but he was still first on the puck and competing everywhere. That’s what I really loved about his game and I try to do that.\n\n\u003e It’s a lot about the food you eat as well. Everyone is training. It’s nutrition that really separates you. \\[Gary Roberts]’s got me on a really good nutrition plan. I’m eating healthy and I think that’s translated to a lot of my success.\n\n\u003e I’ve been training my whole life for this. You work your whole life to hopefully one day get drafted to the NHL and make an NHL team. That’s every kid’s dream.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.754382797Z","tags":null},"/Younger-Kings-players-must-beat-Anze-Kopitar-for-scoring-title-Los-Angeles-Times":{"title":"Younger Kings players must beat Anze Kopitar for scoring title - Los Angeles Times","content":"\n# Younger Kings players must beat Anze Kopitar for scoring title - Los Angeles Times\n\nDate | Site | Link\n---|---|---\n 2022-10-03 | [[LA Times]] | [Younger Kings players must beat Anze Kopitar for scoring title - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-10-03/kings-stanley-cup-contenders-anze-kopitar-phillip-danault-drew-doughty)\n2022-10-03 | [[LA Times]] | [[Younger Kings players must beat Anze Kopitar for scoring title - Los Angeles Times]]\n\n\n## Contributors\n- [[Helene Elliott]]\n\n\n## Players\n- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n- [[Drew Doughty]]\n\n\n## Staff\n- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\n## Summary\n\u003e It says a lot about Anze Kopitar — and the Kings — that he has led them in scoring 14 of the last 15 seasons. \\[...] But as the Kings rise again, they’d be better off if Kopitar doesn’t lead them in scoring this season. At minimum they need him to be seriously challenged for supremacy because that will mean they’ve gathered enough skill and scoring depth to contend for the Cup again.\n\n\n\n\n## Notes and Quotes\n\u003e It’s going to be hard to beat Kopi in scoring, ever. He’s our No. 1 guy for all that type of stuff. Guys like Fiala or Kempe or Danault maybe have an opportunity to outscore him, but to be honest, I don’t really see it happening. I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s 15 of 16. -- [[Drew Doughty]]\n\n\u003e Kopi is still a high-end player that’s capable of playing high-end minutes on our team or any other team in the league. You could drop him on the Stanley Cup champs and they’re going to play him those minutes because he’s a quality player. -- [[Todd McLellan]]\n\n\u003e I feel good, I feel like I’m in good shape and still young enough to log all the minutes. Whoever wins the scoring title, it’s good for me or whoever it’s going to be. But it’s a matter of a team game. That’s what we’ve done in years past and that’s what we have to do. It’s a matter of making sure the team plays the way we need to play to make the playoffs, and then go deep and ultimately go all the way again. -- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\n\u003e The feeling’s good, obviously. I think it was a big step last year, especially with all the injuries that went through this locker room throughout the season, and a much-needed gaining of experience. Because playing in a Game 7 it’s a different type of deal, versus being a 4-1 series \\[loss] or 4-0. The majority of young guys who hadn’t experienced that, they now know how it feels like and what to expect. -- [[Anze Kopitar]]\n\n\u003e I really do think before the three of us retire we’ll have one more Cup in us, at least. -- [[Drew Doughty]]\n\n\u003e We’re on, I guess, maybe the old side of things right now but between me, Quickie and Drew, I think we still have quite a bit left. With the young guys developing as fast and as good as they did, I think it’s most definitely an opportunity to win again. -- [[Anze Kopitar]]","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.754382797Z","tags":null},"/Zach-Dooley":{"title":"Zach Dooley","content":"\n# Zach Dooley\n\nArticle By-lines | Twitter\n-|-\n[Zach Dooley](https://lakingsinsider.com/author/zdooley/) | [@DooleyLAK](https://twitter.com/DooleyLAK)\n\nTitle | Organization \n--- | ---\nManager, Editorial Content | LA Kings\n\n\n\n## NHL  Coverage\nDate | Title\n---|---\n\n\n\n## Minor League Coverage\nDate | Title\n---|---\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.754382797Z","tags":null},"/notes/CJK-+-Latex-Support-%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95":{"title":"CJK + Latex Support (测试)","content":"\n## Chinese, Japanese, Korean Support\n几乎在我们意识到之前，我们已经离开了地面。\n\n우리가 그것을 알기도 전에 우리는 땅을 떠났습니다.\n\n私たちがそれを知るほぼ前に、私たちは地面を離れていました。\n\n## Latex\n\nBlock math works with two dollar signs `$$...$$`\n\n$$f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\n    f\\hat(\\xi),e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x}\n    \\,d\\xi$$\n\t\nInline math also works with single dollar signs `$...$`.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.754382797Z","tags":null},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden.

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](notes/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect!

We've had a ton of injuries this year so it's been a revolving door with our lines but the one common theme has been Vilardi's ability to make the players with him even better.\"\n\nVilardi (6-foot-3, 201 pounds), No. 3 on NHL Central Scouting's midterm list of North American skaters eligible for the 2017 NHL Draft, has attracted the attention of every NHL scout the past two seasons.\n\n![](https://cms.nhl.bamgrid.com/images/photos/287275110/1284x722/cut.jpg)\n\n\"He's very composed with the puck, and uses his vision and playmaking ability to influence the game in all three zones,\" said Matt Ryan of NHL Central Scouting. \"He excels below the dots in the offensive zone where he uses he size and reach to dictate the play and generate scoring opportunities.\"\n\nVilardi has 50 points (24 goals, 26 assists) in 40 games this season, and 88 points (41 goals, 47 assists) in 102 OHL games.\n\n\"The \\[Central Scouting\\] ranking pushes me to work even harder; I'm not at the top and I want to get to the top,\" Vilardi said. \"At the same time you have to make sure you go hard enough to stay \\[No. 3\\]. The draft is still a long way away but it's good that people recognize your hard work.\"\n\nBrandon center Nolan Patrick is No. 1 on Central Scouting's midterm ranking of North American skaters. Halifax center Nico Hischier is No. 2.\n\nVilardi admits he's not yet focused on the 2017 draft. He has many teammates who experienced the same process in 2016, including Logan Brown (Ottawa Senators), Logan Stanley (Winnipeg Jets), Mikhail Sergachev (Montreal Canadiens) and Sean Day (New York Rangers).\n\n\"When you watch the NHL players, they bring it every night, they're always working hard,\" Vilardi said. \"I'm a three-zone player. I'm a big player who works hard down low, am good at making plays off the cycle and seeing plays before they happen.\"\n\nThompson said Vilardi worked very hard on his skating in the offseason and it is the most improved area of his game.\n\n\"He's so well-rounded and smart,\" Thompson said. \"He's extremely coachable; you can make adjustments in-game and change systems and he can adapt to those things because his hockey sense on the ice is very apparent.\"\n\nVilardi is a natural center but has alternated between center and left wing this season because of injuries throughout the Windsor lineup.\n\nHe also hasn't allowed his Canadian upbringing to phase out his Italian heritage. When he isn't scoring goals or creating plays for the Spitfires, he's kicking around a soccer ball or watching the Italian soccer club Inter Milan with his father Lino.\n\n![](https://cms.nhl.bamgrid.com/images/photos/287275116/1284x722/cut.jpg)\n\n\"I chose to play hockey but I play soccer in the summer with my dad and brother,\" Vilardi said. \"As long as I can remember, though, I've always wanted to be a hockey player. I had some success at a young age and pushed even harder to develop, and I think that's why I stuck with it.\"\n\nVilardi's parents are first generation Italians who moved to Kingston, Ontario. His brother, Francesco, who plays for Queen's University in U Sports, started playing hockey when he was 5.\n\nGabriel, four years younger than his brother, soon followed. His teammates in Windsor are grateful he chose hockey over soccer.\n\n\"He's the most hard-working guy I've ever been around,\" Windsor goaltender Michael DiPietro said. \"All he wants to do is be a hockey player and everything he does is centered around the game. That's something I admire about him.\"\n\nIt makes sense DiPietro would recognize Vilardi's work habits since that's what Vilardi feels sets him apart from other prospects in this draft class.\n\n\"I like to work hard; whenever I'm in a 50-50 puck race, I want to win those battles,\" Vilardi said. \"My mindset is, I want to always get better. That's the biggest thing.\"\n\nVilardi will have a golden opportunity to shine on the Canadian Hockey League's biggest stage when the 99th Mastercard Memorial Cup tournament is held in Windsor from May 18-28. The host team receives an automatic invitation to participate against the champions from the Ontario Hockey League, Western Hockey League and Quebec Major Junior Hockey League.\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.758382916Z","tags":null},"/reference/2019-NHL-Draft-Alex-Turcotte-Broad-Street-Hockey":{"title":"","content":"\n# 2019 NHL Draft Profile: Alex Turcotte stats, analysis, and highlights - Broad Street Hockey\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e The 18 year old may not be Jack Hughes, but that doesn’t stop him from being one of the best players of the 2019 draft class.\n\nKyle F.@yachobscoracek\n\nMetadata: \n\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](https://www.broadstreethockey.com/2019/6/12/18661726/alex-turcotte-draft-profile-stats-analysis-analytics-highlights-2019-nhl-draft)\n\n---\nThe major focus on the USA Hockey program this season has been of course the projected first overall pick for seemingly two years now, Jack Hughes. However, there’s a lot more talent in the USA Hockey pipeline, and one of those names is Alex Turcotte. The 18 year old Wisconsin Badger-commit was a force this season on an already stacked team, and has all the tools to be a top line player at the NHL level.\n\n**2019** [**NHL Draft**](http://www.sbnation.com/nhl-draft) **Profile: Alex Turcotte**\n\nPosition/team: C/USNTDP Juniors, USHL (University of Wisconsin commit)  \n2018-19 Statistics: 12 G, 22 A in 16 GP  \nSize: 5’11” 185\n\n**Pre-draft rankings**\n\nNo. 4 (NA Skaters) by [NHL Central Scouting](http://www.nhl.com/ice/draftprospectbrowse.htm)  \nNo. 5 by [Future Considerations](https://futureconsiderations.ca/top-rankings-2019/)  \nNo. 4 by [ISS Hockey](https://www.isshockey.com/iss-hockey-releases-iss-top-31-for-june-rankings-of-the-top-prospects-for-the-2019-nhl-draft/)  \nNo. 3 by [Pronman/The Athletic](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516590\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://theathletic.com/970746/2019/05/21/pronmans-2019-nhl-draft-board-top-107-prospects/\u0026referrer=sbnation.com\u0026sref=https://www.broadstreethockey.com/2019/6/12/18661726/alex-turcotte-draft-profile-stats-analysis-analytics-highlights-2019-nhl-draft\u0026xcust=___sb__p_18425767__t_w__d_D)\n\n## What’s there to like?\n\nA whole lot, as a matter of fact. Turcotte possesses one of the more explosive games in this year’s draft class outside the obvious in Jack Hughes and Kaapo Kakko. Something that I noticed a lot in him is the different ways he can beat defensemen and the goalie. His speed isn’t dominant like his USA teammate in Hughes, but when he gets going he’s tough to stop. Not only does he possess a good top speed, but he’s elusive and can break the puck out efficiently with his skating talent alone. Combine this with his stellar ice vision, passing ability, and dangles you have a multi-dimensional center breakout option that is extremely difficult to defend against.\n\nAnd there in lies potentially Turcotte’s greatest ability: to drive play. Turcotte is able to push play with simply his skating with how explosive he becomes at top speed and his elusiveness. These abilities are so vital in today’s NHL and especially at the center position. If you have a center who can break the puck up with ease, it makes the defensemen’s job all the more simple and relieves some of the pressure they face to carry the puck. As seen by the following [data](https://public.tableau.com/profile/mitchell.brown1648#!/vizhome/CHLComparison/Dashboard3) from the fantastic [Mitchell Brown](https://twitter.com/mitchlbrown?lang=en), Turcotte enters the zone almost just as well as Jack Hughes.\n\n ![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AV-zEKNgTA2oLT07Fbdg7NidBK4=/0x0:966x434/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:966x434):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16334230/Screenshot_2019_06_11_at_6.51.03_PM.png) \n\nDespite his smaller stature at just 5’11” Turcotte consistently hovers around the crease. He’s not afraid to mix it up down low and be physical with his opposition which creates another facet that teams have to prepare for. He’s not going to be a wrecking ball out there, but he’s physical enough that defensemen are going to think twice about the guy chasing them.\n\nNot only does Turcotte wow you with his offensive abilities, he’s no slouch defensively either. His 185 pound frame allows him to compensate for his height, and makes him all the more difficult to deal with offensively and defensively. He’s routinely in position in his own zone and is relentless with his puck pursuit. His aggressive forechecking combined with his speed to recover and overall hockey instincts make him a true threat on the defensive side of the puck.\n\nHe’ll never be the goal scorer that his teammate Cole Caufield is, but his passing ability combined with scoring wingers should make for a dynamic line. Turcotte’s natural passing ability combined with his elite hockey sense to know where the puck and his teammates are and are going to be, make him a lethal threat on the offensive side of the puck. I envision him being an elite play-driving forward at the NHL level with the ability to rack up high assist numbers. Turcotte is easily (if you couldn’t tell by now) one of my favorite players of this draft class.\n\n## What’s not to like?\n\nHonestly the only true fault with Turcotte is for a centerman, he’s not the biggest guy in the world. But once again with his tenacity on the forecheck and overall pace of play, I don’t see it being a major issue. If he can get closer to the 200 pound mark and still retain his speed and explosiveness, I think it would easily compensate his height at the NHL level. If not, worst case he moves to the wing where he can still be a dynamic playmaker and solid defensive winger.\n\n## How would he fit in the [Flyers](https://www.broadstreethockey.com/)’ system?\n\nHe would be right there with Morgan Frost and Joel Farabee and that’s not even up for debate. Turcotte is by far one of the most talented forwards of this draft class and one of the most well-rounded ones as well. He would be a top prospect in the organization the moment he’d be drafted, but sadly, I can’t imagine a way he slips that far.\n\n## Could the Flyers actually get him?\n\nWhich leads me to the next point of no, I don’t conceive a way where the Flyers do get him. The only way I can envision the Flyers drafting Alex Turcotte is by trading up into the top five which doesn’t seem likely. If the Flyers are going to trade the 11th overall pick it seems more than likely it will be trading for a proven NHL talent, rather than acquiring another draft pick in the process. It would be a massive surprise if he falls even outside the top seven and hell if he slips outside of the top five I’d be on the phones immediately looking to get a deal done. The Flyers do have nine draft picks to spare, so might as well use them to get a guy like Turcotte.\n\n## Highlights\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LX-OUssDzyI?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.758382916Z","tags":null},"/reference/2019-NHL-Draft-Alex-Turcotte-Die-By-The-Blade":{"title":"","content":"\n# Draft Profile: Alex Turcotte - Die By The Blade\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e DBTB –\n \nThe Buffalo Sabres fanbase received a bit of disappointment at the NHL Draft Lottery, as they fell from #5 overall to #7.

But do not despair. The good news is that regardless of selection #5 or #7, they will add an excellent, high-end prospect to a fairly deep pool of young players.\n\nThe question is, who is that prospect?\n\nThere is a pile of players in the #3-#12 range that Jason Botterill could believably target given the Sabres need for more talent is pretty broad. All sorts of skill sets, from big playmaking centermen to small, quick goal scoring wings can be had at that #7 spot. I’ll take this opportunity to profile one here.\n\n**ALEX TURCOTTE, C, US DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM**\n\nAnother guy (see Zegras, Trevor or Boldy, Matthew) from the US Development Program who has lived in the shadow of Jack Hughes for the past two years, the 6’0 185# Turcotte spent much of last year laboring behind Hughes. He eventually took over as the U-17 top centerman and showed well once Hughes was called up to the U-18 NTDP team full-time. After his strong performance leading the U-17 team, and performing well in limited time with the U-18 team, the left-shot Turcotte came into his draft season as a guy who was thought to be a serious challenger for #2 overall. That talk got derailed early, as he went down with a nagging hip/back injury and missed the first dozen or so games for the NTDP. His return was anything but triumphant, as he immediately went down with another injury – a shoulder, presumably – in his first game back. So he missed basically the first two months before coming back right before Christmastime, an absence that saw him drop in my rankings. But once he did come back, the NTDP really threw him in the deep end, as Hughes was up with the USA World Juniors team at the time. And the Illinois native didn’t disappoint.\n\nHe finished with an eye-popping 62P in 37 games, including 27 goals. That’s actually slightly better than Hughes as far as PPG (2.17 to 2.0) which isn’t too shabby when you’re playing second fiddle to the top prospect in the Draft. Leading up to the U-18 Championships, where most scouts were waiting to see what Turcotte could do, he managed to get sick and was iffy to play right up until game-time. All he did there was put up 9P in 7 games! So he’s not only extremely skilled, but he’s a gamer! You can watch some of that action [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9N_eVbwfJY) (I apologize for the music). See what a little Thera-Flu can do?\n\nSo what does this kid bring to the table? Turcotte’s game is one of speed, power, and aggression. Has a powerful stride that recalls some of Eichel’s jaunts through the Neutral Zone. A single stride just propels him down the ice. He’s better playing a linear game where he takes a lot of straight lines than someone like a Zegras or Hughes, who have superior edges and lateral movement and lean on that to take advantage of defenders. Turcotte would rather go through you than around you. He’s got remarkable timing – he can find seams at top speed and make a good judgment about exploiting them, with or without the puck. What’s special about him is his tempo. Turcotte always plays with pace, whether offensively or defensively. His skating might not be as graceful or as dazzling as a Hughes or Zegras, but it’s the explosion and the strength of his lower body that gets him where he needs to be ahead of everyone else.\n\nBlessed with exceptional mitts, Turcotte can take bouncing pucks and turn them into pretty saucer passes or pick pucks out of the air on the fly and beat guys wide to attack the net. And attack the net he does. Not afraid of physical play, he seems to relish it, and will fearlessly power through checks or sticks to get to his spot around the cage. Around the net is where he does a lot of his damage, both in terms of scoring goals or setting them up. His play style makes it really tough to take the puck away, either in open ice or along the wall, as he uses that strong lower body much like Crosby to protect the puck from defenders and maintain his balance even against much bigger players. And in open ice, look out. He's got the burst and the superior stick handling to make a defender look silly. Intense competitor who’s motor never slows down, he understands how to manipulate a defense to get open looks while at the same time always being cognizant of his defensive responsibilities and rarely leaves open ice where the other team can get a good chance. Defensively, more than willing. Turcotte has a great feel for defending off the puck, and he’s so confident in his on-puck skills that he will happily pressure a puck carrier without any concern about losing his man or getting beat. Which rarely happens. Very good in the dot as well, I think somewhere in the 58% range. [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvR0e2wpj3c) are some more highlights from the NTDP games for your viewing pleasure.\n\nDoes this guy have a weakness? Not many. His shot is sub-par, honestly. It lacks velocity and accuracy, so he rarely uses it from distance, preferring to operate around the crease, which isn't that big of a drawback, as he's more of a pass-first guy than a shooter. Make no mistake, his speed, hands and smarts make him a very effective finisher in transition. A true puck hound, his speed and determination make him a nightmare on the forecheck but his frenetic style can lend itself to getting banged up, which may become an issue as he plays bigger opponents who can keep up with him skating-wise. In other words, he takes a lot of hits. As far as his competition, I think he’s benefited to some degree from playing behind Hughes, so he hasn’t faced as much of the best defenders night-in, night out. So I’m a little concerned about how high-end his offensive skill is: is he a Couturier/Kesler type of player, which is VERY good, or is there more? Can he carry a line and produce like a Bergeron/Couture? I’m inclined to think the former, but I would not at all be surprised by the latter. Either way, you're getting a heck of a player. If you’re looking for a comparable for Turcotte, one that always gets me is Dougie Gilmour. Not quite as aggressive as Killer (who is?), he's got the same combination of high-end speed, skill, two-way play, and desire in a similarly sized package.\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.758382916Z","tags":null},"/reference/2019-NHL-Draft-Alex-Turcotte-Eyes-On-The-Prize":{"title":"","content":"\n# 2019 NHL Draft prospect: Alex Turcotte could become an elite centremen - Eyes On The Prize\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e There aren’t many players who will be taken before the American in the first round.\n\nDavid St-Louis@DavidSt_Louis\n\nMetadata: \n\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](https://www.habseyesontheprize.com/nhl-entry-draft-picks-2019/2019/6/14/18663582/alex-turcotte-2019-nhl-draft-prospect-profile-video-highlights-stats-scouting-report-analysis)\n\n---\nThe elusive number-one center. It’s said that the way to acquire one is through the draft, as rare are the occasions when a trade or a free-agent acquisition nets you the golden piece around which to build a team. Organizations have to collect their chips and play the lottery, hoping the balls fall in their favour to give them a chance at such a prospect.\n\nAlex Turcotte might not be a number-one-overall talent, but he arguably represents the best chance in the 2019 class after Jack Hughes to add a prospect with such a ceiling.\n\nBirthplace: **Island Lake, Illinois, USA**  \nDate of birth: **February 26, 2001**  \nShoots: **Left**  \nPosition: **Centre**  \nHeight: **5’11”**  \nWeight: **185 lbs.**  \nTeam: **U.S. National Team Development Program**\n\nCircumstances didn’t favour a great season from the centreman. He missed time due to an injury and on the biggest stage for prospects to prove themselves, the World Under-18 Championship, mononucleosis afflicted him. It makes his draft-year performance even more impressive in retrospect. His close to two-point-per-game pace with the USNTDP wasn’t surpassed by anyone other than Hughes, and Turcotte, contrary to his teammate, wasn’t always flanked with the most prolific goal-scorer in the history of the program in Cole Caufield.\n\n ![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a7E2PRhZvD0dKos8oby6ThXHal4=/0x0:554x403/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:554x403):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16343957/Screenshot_2019_06_14_Alex_Turcotte_at_eliteprospects_com.png) [EliteProspects](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/290043/alex-turcotte) \n\nFew draft-eligible prospects could clam to play the game at the same intensity as Turcotte. His high motor is backed by a solid work ethic and understanding of the game. The centreman has the same care for his play on the defensive and offensive side of the ice. He drives the play on the attack, but as soon as possession is contested, he moves back in a sound defensive position, ready to track the puck back to his zone and help his defence.\n\nHe also reads passing lanes well and closes hard on his checks, tirelessly using his stick and body to separate the opposition from possession. The forward might only be 5’11”, but he can play the game with a physical edge.\n\nThe other element that fuels Turcotte’s two-way game is his skating. He is very quick and his wide stance gives him solid balance. The drawback of that stance is that it gives him less speed due to a shorter stride when he moves in a straight line. But considering Turcotte likes to rush up and down the ice with a prominent usage of crossovers, he still has more than enough momentum to burst past defenders when joining the attack.\n\nHe is just as agile a handler as he is a skater. He can open up and pivot, once again feet wide apart to help to protect, and he attacks defenders head-on to thread the puck through their skates.\n\n_Alex Turcotte wears #19 with the USNTDP_\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/54l2wrSFvFY?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nThe first clip in the video above is especially impressive. He rushes from the wide lane, but he doesn’t continue along the wall. He crosses over to the the middle of the ice, brings the puck inside the stick and feet of a defender, then bounces off the check off the opponent and slides the puck behind him to Matthew Boldy for a scoring chance at the door-step.\n\nThere are other examples of Turcotte’s capabilities in the video: his explosive cutbacks, his abrupt change of direction, and his quick hands fending off multiple opposing stick in tight.\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OKaYcGScxsg?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nOff the rush, Turcotte is more of a playmaker, but when his team is established in the offensive zone, to find him you have to look around the net.\n\nThis is where a lot of goals are scored, and the centreman understands how to maximize his success. This season in the USNTDP, he was the net-front presence on their power play. He distinguished himself not really by superior strength or size, but with his ability to get first touch on rebounding pucks and slide to the back post, in position to be on the receiving end of the high-skill plays of his teammates.\n\nHere’s a few sequences illustrating some aspects of Turcotte’s game: his reads, his patience in possession to wait for passing lanes to open, and how he works to steal pucks, find outlets and continuously get open around the net and the slot, pushing against defenders, circling high in the zone to escape his coverage.\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SO_JvLulm_k?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nTurcotte’s highlight reel will probably never be as long as some of his teammates; he isn’t as creative or as flashy. That being said, it’s very likely that he is the second player selected from the U.S Under-18 Developmental Program at the draft, due to the many elements of his play that will translate very well to the professional game. The centreman is effective because, all over the ice, he supports his teammates and makes plays that are conducive to enxtended possession.\n\n ![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vuktPCcjQTvpWo9WftuoPhOGzLk=/0x0:470x482/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:470x482):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16336849/1.png) \n\nFrom Mitch Brown’s [CHL tracking project](https://patreon.com/user?u=13951676)\n\nIt’s therefore no surprise just how well he scores on the shot rates in the advanced stats. He is at the top of the percentile for both Corsi for (ability to generate shot attempts) and Corsi against (ability to limit shot attempts). He also dominates almost all offensive categories, which speaks to his ability to be both a playmaker and scorer depending on the situation.\n\n### Rankings (not all rankings are final)\n\nButton/TSN: **#10**  \nDobber Prospects: **#3**  \nElite Prospects: **#6**  \nFuture Considerations: **#5**  \nHockey Prospect: **#4**  \nMcKenzie/TSN: **#11**  \nNHL Central Scouting: **#4** (NA skaters)  \nPronman/The Athletic: **#3**\n\nNext year, Turcotte will play for the University of Wisconson. It will be interesting to see what he can do with (hopefully) a full, healthy year of hockey as one of the go-to guys in a program only getting stronger by recruiting from the U.S. team. The Badgers are also adding Cole Caufield to a team with one of the better defenceman in the NCAA last year’s 2018 NTDP class, K’Andre Miller.\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.758382916Z","tags":null},"/reference/2019-NHL-Draft-Alex-Turcotte-RSN":{"title":"","content":"\n# 2019 NHL Draft Profile: C Alex Turcotte | RSN\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e From June 10-20, Charlie Roumeliotis will profile one top prospect per day — 11 total — leading up to the 2019 NHL Draft as the Blackhawks prepare to pick third overall.\nAlex Turcotte\nPosition: CenterHeight: 5-foot-11Weight: 185 poundsShoots: Left\nScouting report from Blackhawks vice president of amateur scouting Mark Kelley:\n\"Alex is a highly skilled, strong, highly competitive, good two-way centerman.\"\n\n\n\nMetadata: \n\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/blackhawks/2019-nhl-draft-profile-c-alex-turcotte)\n\n---\n                      2019 NHL Draft Profile: C Alex Turcotte | RSN\n\nJUN 14, 2019\n\nPRESENTED BY BLACKHAWKS INSIDERS\n\nFrom June 10-20, Charlie Roumeliotis will profile one top prospect per day — 11 total — leading up to the 2019 NHL Draft as the Blackhawks prepare to pick third overall.F\n\n## Alex Turcotte\n\n**Position:** Center  \n**Height:** 5-foot-11  \n**Weight:** 185 pounds  \n**Shoots:** Left\n\n**Scouting report from Blackhawks vice president of amateur scouting Mark Kelley:**\n\n\"Alex is a highly skilled, strong, highly competitive, good two-way centerman.\"\n\n**Turcotte describes his own game:**\n\n\"I think I have a lot of skill but also I’m not afraid to go to the dirty areas and then take it to the net, grind it out in the corners. I’m really competitive and I think that’s what drives me and my game and that’s a big part of my game, how competitive I am and how bad I want to win and be the best.\"\n\n\n**NHL player comparable:** Jonathan Toews\n\n**Fit for Blackhawks:**\n\nThere's a lot to like about Turcotte.

Turcotte, who’s father Alfie was a first-round pick of the Montreal Canadiens in 1983, was a key contributor for both the NTDP’s under-17 and under-18 programs, including a midseason promotion to the latter where he produced 16 points in 19 games in a limited role. Turcotte is a low-maintenance center in that he can excel in both optimal and non-optimal conditions, plus handle physicality better than most offensive forwards. He is a fast, agile skater with a wide, powerful stride and the balance of a seasoned NHL power forward. Getting knocked off the puck while he’s either static or moving is something you rarely see.\n\nTurcotte possesses superior vision and passing ability, and it’s clear from his first shift that he understands the game’s intricacies and nuances that require a center to develop chemistry with his linemates. He plays smart hockey with his head on a swivel and attacks with decisiveness, maintaining situational awareness no matter how fast he’s motoring up ice. Turcotte is one of the few draft-eligible forwards who can time his passes with precision while moving as fast as he can. Although he seems to like to defer to the pass, Turcotte owns a hard, accurate wrist shot with a quick release, and he’s proven to snap off high-velocity shots within tight windows.\n\n\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NTDP?src=hash\u0026amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003e#NTDP\u003c/a\u003e: Jack Hughes (Ranked No. 1) scored twice in his return as the 18’s crushed Adrian College 8-3.

From scoring 48 points in 68 games in his first juniors season, Arthur Kaliyev went on to score 102 points, good for 6th in the OHL, and in fact seven behind current Flyer prospect Morgan Frost. Kaliyev was named to the OHL 2nd all star team, and though he still has more to prove, Kaliyev is looking like a sure fire 1st round prospect.\n\n## 2019 [NHL Draft](http://www.sbnation.com/nhl-draft) Profile: Arthur Kaliyev\n\nLeft Wing / USA / Hamilton (OHL)\n\n2018-19 Statistics: 51 G, 51 A in 67 GP\n\nSize: 6-foot-2, 190 pounds\n\n#### Pre-draft rankings\n\nNo. 7 (North American Skaters) by NHL Central Scouting\n\nNo. 30 by Future Considerations\n\nNo. 23 by ISS Hockey\n\nNo. 13 by TSN/Mckenzie\n\n### What’s there to like?\n\nKaliyev is a forward who I’d describe as simply a pure goalscorer. He possesses an excellent wrist shot, and he is effective at getting to the slot for prime scoring chances. Speaking of his shot, he picks corners like he isn’t even trying. This certainly helps when he can read offensive plays as effectively as he does. It’s not luck that he is always finding himself in good scoring positions. It’s very reminiscent of Oskar Lindblom in how effective he is at being in the right place at the right time. His mental processing of the offensive side of the game, along with the goal scoring abilities of a pure sniper, make him an incredibly dangerous weapon when crossing the opposing blue line.\n\nHe’s also improved his playmaking. Kaliyev has become far more patient with the puck, and is good at keeping the puck moving in the offensive zone. He now runs the Hamilton power play, being set up along the half-boards. Even if he is projected as a sniper, his overall offensive game is very good. There isn’t one aspect of his offensive game that I could find fault with.\n\n### What’s not to like?\n\nHe is a player that is willing to take a risk to extend a play, which is a double edged sword. When the risk doesn’t pay off, Kaliyev can get caught out of the play or give away the puck. This is more evident as well because he does not have any particularly defensively oriented instincts. While some may argue that he is there to score, not back check, Kaliyev can sometimes get into habits reminiscent of Jake Voracek on defense, which can be frustrating.\n\nHe’s probably not going to be a guy that carries a line, and will require a playmaking center to feed him the puck. In fairness, this can be said about a lot of wingers. He’s good at taking on defenders one on one, but this isn’t always a reliable skill in the more bruising NHL.\n\n### How would he fit in the [Flyers](https://www.broadstreethockey.com/)’ system?\n\nThere’s one type of player the Flyers lack: a true sniper. Kaliyev would fulfill this role, and would look to project into a very good first line scorer. Imagining Giroux regresses, the first line could be Kaliyev-Couturier-Konecny. The thought of that delights me. Heck, eventually, it could even be Kaliyev-Frost-Konecny. I would like one order of that, please.\n\n### Could the Flyers actually get him?\n\nIf they don’t trade the pick, they absolutely could. It would be a surprising pick, given Kaliyev’s ranking, but it’s 100% possible. Teams like to draft more important positions like center and defense high in the first round, rather than scoring wingers. But, given the Flyers’ organizational needs, I wouldn’t object to the Flyers shocking everybody and taking Kaliyev early. It won’t happen, but hey I can dream.\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TwnkMElynFo?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.758382916Z","tags":null},"/reference/2019-NHL-Draft-Arthur-Kaliyev-Eyes-On-The-Prize":{"title":"","content":"\n# 2019 NHL Draft: Questions linger about Arthur Kaliyev’s NHL projections - Eyes On The Prize\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e Kaliyev has feasted on Junior defence, but there are a few signs that he will be able to adapt to better competition.\n\nDavid St-Louis@DavidSt_Louis\n\nMetadata: \n\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](https://www.habseyesontheprize.com/nhl-entry-draft-picks-2019/2019/6/13/18662114/arthur-kaliyev-2019-nhl-draft-prospect-profile-video-highlights-stats-scouting-report-analysis)\n\n---\nPolarizing is the appropriate word to describe Arthur Kaliyev. Depending on the method used to evaluate him — a more analytics-intensive approach or scouting for tools, game sense, and projectability — Kaliyev can either come out as one of the better potential picks in the draft or one with a lot of question marks, some would say even red flags.\n\nBirthplace: **Tashkent, Uzbekistan**  \nDate of birth: **June 26, 2001**  \nShoots: **Left**  \nPosition: **Wing**  \nHeight: **6’2”**  \nWeight: **190 lbs.**  \nTeam: **Hamilton Bulldogs (OHL)**\n\nThe main issue in ranking Kaliyev is that he operates quietly. He isn’t a _put your head down, hustle, and skate the puck into the net_ kind of player. He isn’t a power foward who overpowers his peers in front of the net (even if his stature would suggest he could be), and he isn’t a flashy dangler who goes through entire teams to score.\n\nKaliyev drifts, glides, floats away from the sight of the opposing team and, to an extent, spectators, and comes up with a few goals, inflating his totals higher and higher, forcing eyes onto him after they glance at the stat sheet to figure out just what is going on.\n\nHe is quite unique. It’s hard to reconcile 51 goals — an incredible feat for a draft-eligible player, one that hasn’t been matched by many over the years and puts him in company of players like Alex DeBrincat and Jeff Skinner — to what appears to be a detached playstyle. The sheer numbers are impressive, but will he be able to replicate his success as he rises in the levels of hockey?\n\n ![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sbhri9HfaWJX2B4jPJuWoaMijaI=/0x0:768x176/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:768x176):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16341162/Screenshot_2019_06_12_Arthur_Kaliyev_at_eliteprospects_com.png) [EliteProspects](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/316114/arthur-kaliyev) \n\nThe number-one element that will help him score goals at the next level is his shot. Kaliyev is a deadly weapon from the right faceoff circle, his off-side as a left-shot winger. He scored 20 of his 51 goals on the power play, and a good part of those markers where from that position.\n\nKaliyev fires pucks with a short-windup slapshot. He understands that the most important aspect of his release is speed: how quickly he can get a puck sliding toward him to fly to the net before the goalie has time to get to his left post. He takes a quick peek at the net as he is about to receive a pass and adjusts his shot to best have it slip by the netminder’s coverage.\n\nThe first sequence in the video below has a great camera angle of Kaliyev’s work at the right circle. He stands very low in the zone, below the dot and closer to the goal line. It doesn’t give him as much net to shoot at, but it’s the furthest distance for the goalie to travel to block his shot. As the puck slides to him, he engages the rotation of his body by opening up his hips and pointing his right foot toward the net, adding power to his shot but still controlling his release to place the puck between the post and the glove of the goalie.\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tjc2C07lhXY?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nThat’s not to say that Kaliyev can’t just hammer it home, which he does a couple of times in the video from the same power-play spot. He simply adapts his release to the situation. There’s a clip in the video where the winger one-times a pass that falls completely behind him, strictly using his body rotation to get it on net. He also chooses a catch-and-release wrist-shot motion when he feels that more elevation will be necessary to beat the goalie. Finally, when he faces a fully-set netminder, his shot becomes a playmaking weapon. He shoots for rebounds, keeping the puck low or transforming his firing motion into a hard pass to the back post for a tap-in attempt, and fakes using his release to thread a pass to teammates in the slot.\n\nHe can take the puck through the defence himself at times. He will chain a few rapid moves to thread the puck inside opposing sticks and skates and get a one-on-one chance with the goalie. But he is at his best when being set up.\n\nThe winger is all about finding quiet ice. He controls his skating, trying to join the attack deceptively and remain unchecked for the longest time possible. This is how he scores his goals at even strength. Being left alone in the offensive zone can be a product of some lapses in defensive coverage — and there are a lot of them in Junior hockey — but also of the skating routes he chooses and his ability to anticipate offensive and defensive schemes.\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NVj2RquiNjY?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nIn the clips above, you can see Kaliyev slow down, move east-west to remain in a passing lane, or change the position of his stick (bringing it behind him, for example) to create a new seam in which to receive the puck. He also waits for the defence to be pushed back before drifting into the zone. Trailing the play gives him space to get closer to the net and fire. When the puck gets to the point, the winger doesn’t immediately rush the net, but aims to arrive at the back post at the same time as the blue-line shot hits the net. Stick on the ice, he gets prime rebound occasions.\n\nThose natural tendencies contribute to making him the goal-scorer that he is. Being able to find and create space and time yourself for the best opportunities are skills. The drawback is that it makes him play at a slower pace compared to his peers, and this is where the common questions surrounding the prospect come from.\n\nKaliyev is the guy who will sometime forfeit defensive positioning or a battle for a loose puck to take a step toward the offence, anticipating or hoping that his team wins possession and he gets an opportunity to set himself up for a scoring chance at the other end of the ice. The good ones start from rapid transitions, and he definitely knows that. The winger can also force some passes as he takes the puck from zone to zone, as his preferred play is to arrive as the shooting option in the offensive zone.\n\nIt comes down to this: It’s rare to see the scorer use the full extent of his motor. Sometimes it’s for good reason (as in the above examples of his goals), but other times it would benefit him to raise the tempo. He isn’t a top skater, but even considering his upright form and his lack of knee-bend, Kaliyev can still muster some speed, especially with the usage of crossovers.\n\nAlthough the player he is up against in this sequence is Kevin Bahl (who isn’t exactly a speedster), you can see Kaliyev, enticed by the breakaway opportunity, separate with quick bursts and take the puck to the net.\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4XZOWmAQyqY?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nHis shot should allow him to produce at the NHL level, but if he wants to have further success and feature on the goal-scoring leaderboard he will have to adjust his feel for where the space is in the offensive zone and his goal-scoring timing to the much higher pace. That will require him to work on his skating and generally play the game a few higher gears.\n\nThe faith in his capacity to do that is reflected in the rankings of the prospect over different scouting services.\n\n### Rankings (not all rankings are final)\n\nButton/TSN: **#13**  \nDobber Prospects: **#18**  \nElite Prospects: **#11**  \nFuture Considerations: **#30**  \nHockey Prospect: **#34**  \nMcKenzie/TSN: **#13**  \nNHL Central Scouting: **#7** (NA skaters)  \nPronman/The Athletic: **#14**\n\nOn draft day, it’s likely that Kaliyev falls in the middle of the first round due to the risk he represents. There are other top prospects who don’t have the same concerns about their intensity who will likely go before the goal-scorer, but the package of skill he has also won’t let him fall too far in the first round.\n\nIt’s possible one lottery team with more analytically inclined views could find hidden value in the player. The dominant production that places him in somewhat elite company is one thing, but Kaliyev also comes out as quite an interesting prospect in Mitch Brown’s CHL tracking project.\n\n ![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3pcVoagCCMrGELgwM2fdyWILCq4=/0x0:471x472/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:471x472):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16334342/2.png) \n\nFrom Mitch Brown’s [CHL tracking project](https://www.patreon.com/user/posts?u=13951676)\n\nAs expected, he’s near the top of all shooting categories, but the passing grades also paint him as capable playmaker and transition skater, especially when it comes to getting the puck in the offensive zone.\n\nWhat’s really interesting is the entry defence category. Kaliyev scores highly in backchecking involvement, which runs counter to what is often perceived as a weakness in his game. This can’t be interpreted as proof of a strong two-way game for the forward since it’s supplementary information, but it’s still interesting to note his effectiveness in tracking pucks back and breaking plays in the neutral zone.\n\nHis playmaking capabilities, those defensive stats, and his work at times on the penalty kill could be good indications that there is more to Kaliyev than his goal-scoring identity. He represents an interesting project to take on for a team’s development staff as they look to broaden his game and push it to the next level to match how he will have to perform against professionals.\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.758382916Z","tags":null},"/reference/2019-NHL-Draft-Arthur-Kaliyev-RSN":{"title":"","content":"\n# 2019 NHL draft profile: What's the read on Arthur Kaliyev? | RSN\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e The 2019 NHL entry draft is Friday and Saturday in Vancouver, British Columbia.

He understands angles and spacing as he scored 51 goals in 67 regular-season games for the OHL's Hamilton Bulldogs. Kaliyev isn't just a finisher, either. He tallied 51 assists, giving him 102 points on the season.\n\nThis was an interesting tidbit on Kaliyev from [TSN's Bob McKenzie](https://www.tsn.ca/americans-set-to-dominate-first-round-of-the-nhl-draft-1.1323878):\n\n\u003e Inconsistency of effort has created a polarizing effect among scouts. In the TSN survey of 10 scouts, one had Kaliyev in the top 10 and another had him outside the top 40. The others had him spread out in between, totaling six votes in the first round and four in the second. No other prospect ranked in the first round has such a wide variance.\n\nNHL Central Scouting has Kaliyev ranked as the seventh-best North American skater, ahead of Caufield, Matthew Boldy and Peyton Krebs.\n\n### **Fit with Flyers**\n\nKaliyev has been a teammate of Flyers prospect Matthew Strome the past two seasons, so the club's development and scouting staff has likely seen a good bit of the winger.\n\nIt all comes down to what the Flyers think of Kaliyev (as well as the teams ahead of them).\n\nThere aren't a ton of flawless teenage prospects. Kaliyev will turn 18 years old next week and his game/effort in all three zones can be worked on over time.\n\nThere's no doubt a 51-goal scorer in just his second year of junior hockey is intriguing.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.758382916Z","tags":null},"/reference/2019-NHL-Draft-Arthur-Kaliyev-The-Draft-Analyst":{"title":"","content":"\n# 2019 Draft Profile: RW Arthur Kaliyev : The Draft Analyst\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e One of the top wingers for the 2019 NHL Draft is shredding the OHL after an impressive rookie season a year ago.\n\n\n\nMetadata: \n\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](https://www.thedraftanalyst.com/2019-nhl-draft/2019-draft-profile-rw-arthur-kaliyev/)\n\n---\n**2019 NHL Draft**\n\n### Arthur Kaliyev\n\n### **Hamilton Bulldogs (OHL)**\n\n**Steve Kournianos**  |  10/08/2018 |  Nashville  |  \\[hupso\\]\n\nPhoto courtesy of Terry Wilson/OHL Images\n\n![](https://www.thedraftanalyst.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/arthur-kaliyev.jpg \"arthur-kaliyev\")\n\nProfile\n\n**Position:** Right Wing  \n**Shoots**: Left  \n**Height / Weight**: 6’1, 190 lbs  \n**Born:** June 26th, 2001 | Delray Beach, FL  \n**Nation:** United States\n\n\nScouting Report\n\nA goal-scoring winger with an excellent shot, Kaliyev was impressive last season as a rookie for the Hamilton Bulldogs, who won the OHL postseason title and nearly captured the Memorial Cup. His 30 goals were the most by any 16-year-old OHL’er since Alex Galchenyuk scored 31 for Sarnia in 2010-11. There are several aspects of Kaliyev’s game that stand out, namely his shot and ability to get open for clean looks at the net. He can finish in a variety of ways on both his forehand and backhand, and his one-timer from the circles is devastatingly accurate. Kaliyev’s ability to make quick bursts to the net from a static position creates a dilemma for defenders, since affording him too much room to shoot is equally as dangerous and playing him tight.\n\nAlthough Kaliyev has a strong upper body and powerful leg drive, he isn’t a physically-intimidating power forward. He uses his above-average speed and stickhandling to quickly counter up ice and maintain possession while being harassed, but you wouldn’t classify him as a crease crasher. Kaliyev spends a significant amount of time away from puck battles but can hold him own in the corners. He has soft hands and is a very good passer for a sniper, and Kaliyev appears to develop immediate chemistry with any center or linemate. Kaliyev likely isn’t the first player a coach will summon to kill a penalty or suffocate an opponent’s late-period rally, but his goal scoring ability for a teenager most certainly is elite.\n\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AAPG?src=hash\u0026amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003e#AAPG\u003c/a\u003e: C Alex Turcotte (Ranked No. 3) slows it down, jukes a few times before sending a perfect pass to LW Arthur Kaliyev (Ranked No. 18), who blisters one past Dustin Wolf. \u003ca href=\"https://t.co/1rgP26zdka\"\u003epic.twitter.com/1rgP26zdka\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u0026mdash; Steve Kournianos (@TheDraftAnalyst) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDraftAnalyst/status/1042571999883800576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eSeptember 20, 2018\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e \u003cscript async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.758382916Z","tags":null},"/reference/2019-NHL-Draft-Trevor-Zegras-Broad-Street-Hockey":{"title":"","content":"\n# 2019 NHL Draft Profile: Trevor Zegras, an American two-way forward with exceptional skating ability - Broad Street Hockey\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e Another American could crack the top 10.\n\nJohanGartner@JohanGartner\n\nMetadata: \n\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](https://www.broadstreethockey.com/2019/6/14/18661567/2019-nhl-draft-profile-trevor-zegras-a-two-way-forward-with-exceptional-skating-ability-american)\n\n---\nThe US National U18 team has a lot of really good prospects this year with the likes of [Jack Hughes](https://www.broadstreethockey.com/2019/6/12/18662032/2019-nhl-draft-profile-the-jack-hughes-and-kaapo-kakko-experience-is-upon-us-chuck-fletcher-flyers) and [Cole Caufield](https://www.broadstreethockey.com/2019/6/13/18677146/cole-caufield-draft-profile-stats-analysis-highlights-2019-nhl-draft) leading the way. Another really good prospect is the Bedford, NY native Trevor Zegras, who is projected to go early in the first round. Lets have a look and see if he could be someone the [Flyers](https://www.broadstreethockey.com/) might have interest in for this upcoming draft.\n\n#### **BSH 2019 Draft Profile: Trevor Zegras**\n\n**Position/Team:** C/W / US National U18 Team (Boston University commit)\n\n**2018-19 Statistics:** 26 G 61 A, in 60 GP\n\n**Size:** 6’0” 174 lbs\n\n#### **Pre-draft rankings**\n\n#5 [Hockeyprospect.com](https://www.eliteprospects.com/draft-center/2019/hockeyprospect.com)\n\n#8 [Future Considerations](https://www.eliteprospects.com/draft-center/2019/future-considerations)\n\n#10 [ISS hockey](https://www.eliteprospects.com/draft-center/2019/iss-hockey)\n\n#6 [McKeens hockey](https://www.eliteprospects.com/draft-center/2019/mckeen-s-hockey)\n\n#8 [Bob McKenzie](https://www.tsn.ca/hughes-kakko-in-tight-race-for-top-spot-1.1284470)\n\n## What’s there to like?\n\nWhere to start? Zegras is, first of all, a two-way forward with terrific skating ability. His mobility helps him dictate the play and his first step or two really sets him apart from other players. He loves to get under the skin of the opponents, and while he is mainly a playmaker, he has great hand-eye coordination and he is dangerous with deflections around the net — great hockey IQ.\n\nZegras takes pride in his defensive play and he uses the great speed of his to back-check and position himself where he is needed. He reads the plays really well and uses his active stick to create turnovers for counter-attacks. He has that ability to “always be on the right side of the puck”. He also relies on his smarts and speed all over the ice which always makes him a threat.\n\n## What’s not to like?\n\nZegras is a very well-rounded player who has the tools to become a very good NHL player, but he may need a year or two at Boston University to continue to work on his game and bulk up. He can be a perimeter player in the offensive zone at times, which is something that might fix itself when he gets stronger.\n\n## How would he fit in the Flyers’ system?\n\nFlyers are still working on signing Kevin Hayes to fill the second line center role, and if he signs the Flyers will be pretty stacked at center, especially with Morgan Frost in the pipeline as well. The good thing with Zegras is that he’s very flexible and can also play the wing, which is where he would most likely play if the Flyers drafted him.\n\n## Could the Flyers actually get him?\n\nZegras has been ranked anywhere between fifth and tenth depending on which ranking you check, and while there’s a possibility that he can fall all the way to 11th, I’d be surprised if he actually went outside of the top 10. His skill-set, along with him playing a “pro game” already, will help his chances of being drafted before it’s the Flyers turn to pick.\n\n## **Highlights**\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hH6XFpEhLr4?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.758382916Z","tags":null},"/reference/2019-NHL-Draft-Trevor-Zegras-Die-By-The-Blade":{"title":"","content":"\n# Draft Profile: Trevor Zegras - Die By The Blade\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e DBTB –\n \nThe Buffalo Sabres fanbase received a bit of disappointment at the NHL Draft Lottery, as they fell from #5 overall to #7.

But do not despair. The good news is that regardless of selection #5 or #7, they will add an excellent, high-end prospect to a fairly deep pool of young players.\n\nThe question is, who is that prospect?\n\nThere is a pile of players in the #3-#12 range that Jason Botterill could believably target given the Sabres need for more talent is pretty broad. All sorts of skill sets, from big playmaking centermen to small, quick goal scoring wings can be had at that #7 spot. I’ll take this opportunity to profile one here.\n\n**TREVOR ZEGRAS, C/LW, US DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM**\n\nA 5’11 1/2, 170# left-shot forward who is comfortable in the middle or on the wing, Zegras is a 2001-born player from downstate in Bedford, New York. An absolutely dynamite playmaking forward, he’s one of the top passers in the Draft Class. Most importantly, he can make elite plays at top speed. Has been very good all year, having scored the game-winner at the All-American Top Prospects game at the start of the season, and named the best player for the USA at the 5 Nations tournament in February. Notched an impressive 87 points in 60 games for the NTDP, shockingly only 4th on the NTDP in terms of points-per-game. Added 9 points in 5 games for the US in the Under-18 World Championships, despite coming off a shoulder injury in the preliminary games that kept him out of the first couple of round-robin games in that tournament. You can catch some of those highlights [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klPcg4P0m7w). That pass starting at 00:25 seconds is ridiculous.\n\nZegras possesses an uncanny knack for understanding space, creating it, and using it to his advantage. Misdirection is one of the most important weapons in his arsenal. Uses a variety of fakes, look offs, and changes of direction to distract opponents while putting sauce right on the tape of his linemates. Even on simple plays, he will throw in a small flourish – a change of pace, or a look-away, to freeze a defender for a half-second. He’s almost over-confident with the puck, as he’ll make behind-the-back passes, between his legs, no-look or try to saucer a pass through a half-dozen sticks when he sees an opening, and more often than not can put the puck into areas of the ice where only his teammates can reach it and turn it into a positive play. Very smart player who reads the defense instantly and finds a counter. Wizard-like hands are always in motion, and he’s equally good on his fore- or back-hand. Can dangle you to death with his incredible stick-handling.\n\nOne of the top skaters in the Class, he’s super quick and can explode out of a dead stop or changes in direction. He moves laterally with both ease and sharpness, and every stride seems designed to get him an advantage. Using his lateral mobility he can protect the puck by driving off defenders with speed or stepping around them. Will walk a defender to the outside, but Zegras prefers to threaten to go by a defender, get them on their heels, and then pull up to open up all kinds of space for himself to find a teammate. Thanks to his ridiculous handle and that skating, he can create clean zone entries at will. He’s particularly dangerous running the Power Play off the half-wall or at the point, with his NTDP coach pointing out that Zegras will be the best special teams player on whatever college team he goes to right out of the box (FYI – he’ll be at Boston University next season). High praise. You can check out some of his game (without Hughes) [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-jv-71HZLM).\n\nA feature to his game he shares with Eichel is his ability to think the game at high speed. He recognizes openings and defenses even when skating full steam and has the presence of mind always try making a play rather than play it safe.\n\nAll that said, he’s still got some blemishes to his game. Some will claim his gaudy numbers are a result of playing with Jack Hughes, but he drove his own line for more than a few games this season with Hughes out for the [World Juniors](https://www.sbnation.com/world-junior-hockey) and Turcotte out with injury. You might be able to say that Hughes’ gaudy stats might not be so impressive without Zegras feeding him. So he doesn’t need to play with great players, but his playmaking ability is best employed when he’s skating with other talented offensive players who know where to be on the ice. He isn’t a pure goal scorer, and can tend to overpass, leaving good scoring opportunities on the table in favor of the extra pass. He’ll need to pick his spots better as the competition improves. Looking to shoot more often would help, but he doesn’t have a big shot. In fact, his clapper is rather pedestrian, and although he’s very accurate in picking spots, neither his wrist shot nor his release are exceptional. Yet there’s an that innate sense of where the puck is, and he can find it in a crowd and lift it in a second with those butter-soft hands of his.\n\nZegras is dogged on the puck, which makes him a very dangerous forechecker and very willing backchecker. That said, he needs some work when defending off the puck, where he can get too eager to blow the zone and loses his guy. In a way, his defensive game resembles [Jeff Skinner](https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/297073/jeff-skinner). As a very accomplished puck possession player, he’s still very slight (6’0, 170#), so he can get pushed around pretty easily by bigger D-Men and forwards on the wall, and all the slick moves in the world won’t help when you’re pinned against the boards. So he’ll need to bulk up.\n\nZegras is a true game breaker. To me, the only player who has a better pure skill/speed combination in this Draft is Jack Hughes.\n\nThis is a FanPost written by a member of the community.

That includes the team’s season in the USHL and contests against NCAA opponents. He also ended the year with nine points in five games at the World Under-18 Championship after missing the start of the tournament due to injury.\n\n ![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lp7AboLFKMatStlPitwaFPhx7rI=/0x0:549x318/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:549x318):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16234408/Screenshot_2019_05_10_Trevor_Zegras_at_eliteprospects_com.png) [EliteProspects](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/424453/trevor-zegras) \n\nWhat drives Zegras’s offensive success is his passing ability. The forward can make very difficult feeds look easy with his incredible vision. This talent makes him stand out from just about everyone else in this 2019 draft class. Rare are the games when he doesn’t impress one way or another with beautiful setups that would not be attempted by most players, or even occur to them.\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1yX9e9lZqHA?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nTake a look at this collection of plays made by the forward during the season. Zegras can use his backhand or forehand just as efficiently to set up a lot of different passes:\n\n-   Send the puck into space for a teammate to skate into;\n-   Use the boards to make indirect feeds halfway across the ice;\n-   Challenge the defence to create a pocket behind him in which to drop the puck, giving a teammate a chance to release from the slot;\n-   Do the same, but instead follow it by lobbing a pass to a teammate driving to the net;\n-   Slide the puck across the Royal Road (from one side of the ice to the other) through multiple sticks and skates, or;\n-   Spin on himself, or go through his legs inside the defensive coverage, to create passing lanes that weren’t previously there.\n\nHe shows a lot of diversity and creativity in his feeds. It allowed him to collect assists at a rhythm of better than one per game.\n\nZegras isn’t overly deceptive in his passes, contrary to many other playmakers who rely on manipulating the defence to open passing lanes. Instead, on top of his ingenuity he relies on his precision, his quick execution, and a stickhandling ability that rivals some of the best handlers in the draft to create many of his memorable plays.\n\nThose abilities also allow him to create chances for himself. He combines his shifty handling with heel pushes and turns within his wide-skating base to get inside the sticks and skates of defenders, constantly altering his stick grip to adjust his manoeuvres as opponent’s flail away at the puck.\n\nHere are a few sequences taken from both games versus the Russian Under-18 team that showcase Zegras’s hands.\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ngNGecoiZ_0?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nThe forward would be even more dangerous if he were to combine his attacks with the speed he possesses more often. As he consistently looks for passing targets, he slows down upon entering the offensive zone to look for support, exploiting the space between the defenders and the backcheck that was present at his level of play but won’t be as common at higher levels. By keeping his feet moving, using his high agility and finding a better mix between shooting and passing, Zegras would be just as dangerous with the puck on his stick against better opponents; no matter their defensive response, he would have an answer.\n\nIt’s a safe bet that he will learn to adapt as the challenges grow. He is incredibly skilled, and he could be counted on for different roles inside the U.S. National Team Development Program. He played both on the wing and at centre this season, and some of his best games came when he acted as the number-one center for the team during Jack Hughes’s absence for the [World Juniors](https://www.sbnation.com/world-junior-hockey). In that time, Zegras showed himself capable of playing a solid two-way game while retaining the full force of his offence.\n\nHe is capable of some physical play, but most of his defensive success comes from timely stick lifts while tracking the puck back to his zone, stealing it in between blue lines to immediately spring his team on offence.\n\nThis ability was reflected in his advanced stats. The forward was one of the most involved in the backcheck in all of the tracked data. Looking broadly at the numbers, his offensive prowess also led to him ranking at the top of many scoring categories, especially the ones related to playmaking: expected primary assists, shot assists, and one-timer assists.\n\n ![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DqK7pFrfXpgpnqn2SB_nZFg-nN4=/0x0:474x477/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:474x477):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16212369/1.png) \n\nFrom Mitch Brown’s [tracking project](https://www.patreon.com/user/overview?u=13951676)\n\nIn June, Zegras is projected to be selected in the top 10 of the draft by many scouting services. His passing talent makes him a very desirable target for a team looking for help on the power play or a setup man for their shooters. That being said, it’s also possible to see the USNTDP forward fall slightly outside the projections to an organization picking in the middle of the first round. His offensive game isn’t as well-rounded as some of the other top picks. His tendency to force passes might have some teams hesitate to call his name on the podium with an early pick.\n\n### Rankings (not all rankings are final)\n\nElite Prospects: **#21**  \nFuture Considerations: **#10**  \nHockey Prospect: **#10**  \nISS Hockey: **#9**  \nMcKeen’s Hockey: **#7**  \nMcKenzie/TSN: **#10**  \nNHL Central Scouting: **#6** (NA skaters)\n\nNext year, Zegras will join some of his supporting cast at Boston University, where he will get an occasion to be the main engine behind the team’s offence over a full season. It will be a new challenge for the prospect, but one he has the talent to meet.\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.758382916Z","tags":null},"/reference/2019-NHL-Draft-Trevor-Zegras-RSN":{"title":"","content":"\n# 2019 NHL Draft Profile: C Trevor Zegras | RSN\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e From June 10-20, Charlie Roumeliotis will profile one top prospect per day — 11 total — leading up to the 2019 NHL Draft as the Blackhawks prepare to pick third overall.\nTrevor Zegras\nPosition: Center\nHeight: 6-foot-0\nWeight: 169 pounds\nShoots: Left\nScouting report from Blackhawks vice president of amateur scouting Mark Kelley:\n\n\n\nMetadata: \n\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html)\n\n---\n                      2019 NHL Draft Profile: C Trevor Zegras | RSN\n\nJUN 18, 2019\n\nPRESENTED BY BLACKHAWKS INSIDERS\n\nFrom June 10-20, Charlie Roumeliotis will profile one top prospect per day — 11 total — leading up to the 2019 NHL Draft as the Blackhawks prepare to pick third overall.\n\n## Trevor Zegras\n\n**Position:** Center  \n**Height:** 6-foot-0  \n**Weight:** 169 pounds  \n**Shoots:** Left\n\n**Scouting report from Blackhawks vice president of amateur scouting Mark Kelley:**\n\n\"Trevor is a high skilled centerman, very good skater, very, very creative, comfortable and creative with the puck.\"\n\n**Zegras describes his own game:**\n\nOn his creativity: \"I think growing up, watching a bunch of guys in the NHL like Patrick Kane mess around the ice, just something I’ve always done as a little kid.

The vision, the passing, the skating, the playmaking ability, the hockey IQ. He has it all offensively, and also doesn't get enough credit for his two-way game.\n\nZegras is somebody that has quickly been rising on draft boards, and it's because he has the potential to be a 90-point player in the NHL as a center. His name has been discussed by the Blackhawks at No. 3 and he's certainly a tempting option. Pair Zegras with Kane for the next decade and it's scary to think about the numbers the two could put up together.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.758382916Z","tags":null},"/reference/2019-NHL-Draft-Trevor-Zegras-The-Draft-Analyst":{"title":"","content":"\n# 2019 Draft Profile: C Trevor Zegras : The Draft Analyst\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e 2019 NHL Draft\n\n\n\nMetadata: \n\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](https://www.thedraftanalyst.com/2019-nhl-draft/2019-draft-profile-c-trevor-zegras/)\n\n---\n**2019 NHL Draft**\n\n### Trevor Zegras\n\n### **U.S. U18 (NTDP)**\n\n**Steve Kournianos**  |  09/04/2018 |  Nashville  |  \\[hupso\\]\n\nPhoto courtesy of Rena Laverty\n\n![](https://www.thedraftanalyst.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Zegras-PIC-RENA-690x438.jpg \"Zegras PIC - RENA\")\n\nProfile\n\n**Position:** Center  \n**Shoots**: Left  \n**Height / Weight**: 6’0, 167 lbs  \n**Born:** March 20th, 2001 | Bedford, NY  \n**Nation:** United States\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"895\" height=\"503\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i7DwgB23YVk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n\nScouting Report\n\nSlick playmaking center with exceptional hockey sense who last year took over the NTDP’s top line after Jack Hughes and Alex Turcotte were promoted, and spent a good chunk of this season as a left wing. Zegras, who is committed to Boston University, is very dangerous with the puck and appears quite comfortable handling the responsibilities inherent in leading a talented squad’s offense. He is both crafty and fancy with the puck, and his passes almost always are on the tape with authority. Zegras’s pass accuracy remains consistent anywhere on the ice and he’s just as dangerous threading the needle while manning the half wall as he is in open ice. His ability to stickhandle while keeping his head up allows him to be the first to identify trailers or back-door cutters, and Zegras will use no-look centering passes on the power play to exploit an open passing lane. He’s also capable of tricking goalies with a hard, accurate shot that he can tuck under the bar from bad angles.\n\nZegras plays engaged with or without the puck and stays in motion in all three zones. He locks in on the puck regardless of where it is or whether or not he’s in control. Once he’s corralled it, Zegras can use a variety of stutter steps, gear changes or pirouettes to motor past, around or through traffic. His agility is outstanding, and he always seems to make the right reads when anticipating puck travel. Zegras is a strong, agile skater with very good straight-line speed who can stay low to the ice and maintain his elite balance as he zips through the neutral zone into opposing territory. His zone entries are surgical and designed to create time and space while maintaining possession. He is very good on faceoffs and will play physical along the boards. Zegras also has a mean streak and will get involved in scrums after the whistle.\n\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/U18?src=hash\u0026amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003e#U18\u003c/a\u003e: Happy Greek Easter to Trevor Zegras (Ranked No. 4) who flashes his skill with a neat pass to Cam York for an absolute laser.

The way in which he plays the game can immediately translate to the NHL and his terrific skill set will allow him to play the same style effectively against the best in the world.\n\nByfield’s case is different.\n\n### Beginning with the end in mind\n\nTo paraphrase the concept from _The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People_, we need to first understand what we are looking to get out of Byfield as an NHLer. By elaborating on our expectations and laying out the ideal outcome of his development process, we’ll have a better idea of what to prioritize.\n\n_Byfield’s best-case scenario in the NHL:_\n\n_1) Plays center_\n\n_2) Is a plus-value contributor both special teams_\n\n_3) Challenges for 20 minutes of ice time or more per game_\n\n_4) Scores at at a point-per-game pace once his game is at maturity_\n\n**If we were to throw Byfield into the fire at the start of the 2020-21 season, I anticipate that he will fail on all four counts.**\n\n### Show me how you move; tell me who you are\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hZNswSiGo94?rel=0\u0026amp;autoplay=0\u0026amp;showinfo=0\u0026amp;enablejsapi=0\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" gesture=\"media\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowautoplay=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"728\" height=\"409\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nAbove are Byfield’s first two shifts against the Niagara Ice Dogs on February 28, 2020 (video via InStat).\n\nThe sequences are fairly representative of Byfield’s overall game - his exceptional acceleration, strength and reach are on display, and he looks to be a factor all over the ice by hounding the puck aggressively.\n\n[![Future Watch: top ten 2020 draft prospects to watch at the Hlinka ...](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a7ac87b-ce5c-423c-b112-1e65d412c4fb_900x600.jpeg \"Future Watch: top ten 2020 draft prospects to watch at the Hlinka ...\")](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a7ac87b-ce5c-423c-b112-1e65d412c4fb_900x600.jpeg)\n\n_(Image: Terry Wilson, OHL Images)_\n\nBut once he gets a first touch on the puck, Byfield becomes his own worst enemy.

But the Russian’s posture is more vertical, allowing him to keep his chin up and to go from free skating to puck handling with a minimum of fuss.\n\nMalkin’s shoulders are roughly in line with his knees, while Byfield’s shoulders are way in front, preventing him from rotation on-axis and shift laterally on his first touch.\n\nByfield’s postural issue flares up in other aspects of the game. Because his center of gravity is way forward, he has trouble loading his ankles and staying low through sharp turns. When he decides to cut back to shake off a defender, he straightens his legs, then quickly sinks his pelvis to dig into the ice and change direction. This is sub-optimal because an NHL caliber defenseman can either push him off the puck as he lifts his body or catch up to him and get a stick on the puck when he slows to a near-standstill in the middle of his turn.\n\nThe huge variability in his posture throughout a possession might even have positional implications. Give Byfield a quick pass on his backhand low in the defensive zone and see what happens: he stiffens up, his feet get stuck and he bobbles the puck. Hardly ideal for a center who is counted on to be flawless under pressure on breakouts.\n\n_Byfield’s worst-case scenario in the NHL:_\n\n_1) Plays left wing_\n\n_2) Is a middle-six forechecking specialist_\n\n_3) Plays 10-14 minutes per game, mostly in a shutdown and PK role_\n\n_4) Scores less than 30 points a year_\n\nWhat I’m describing above is still a tremendously valuable player. But it would a far cry from what Byfield’s capable of.\n\nAny NHL coach can do a job of channeling Byfield’s exceptional athleticism and hunger into hunting for loose pucks, taking the body and killing the opposing team’s offensive sequences.\n\nBut it will take some doing to help Byfield use his skills to create as opposed to destroy.\n\n### Embrace the chaos\n\nIn _The Art of Learning_, chess prodigy and martial arts champion Josh Waitzkin describes a particular challenge in his journey toward excellence:\n\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d4827fc-bb57-41cc-9744-1e2793c62bd5_550x205.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d4827fc-bb57-41cc-9744-1e2793c62bd5_550x205.png)[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F172c5608-5e2a-42a7-a9b5-e90958bbd973_534x328.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F172c5608-5e2a-42a7-a9b5-e90958bbd973_534x328.png)\n\nWaitzkin was never quite able to reconcile Dvoretsky and Razuvaev’s opposing views through the medium of chess.

While Waitzkin was one of the best young players in the world, he never reached his potential as a senior and left chess to pursue an entirely different discipline.\n\nByfield is similar in the sense that he still plays a raw, instinctive, major-junior style of hockey as opposed to the fast but intensely structured version of the sport we see at the NHL level. He is at his best capitalizing on broken plays and sniffing for offense in the grey areas of the play rather than confined to a spot and told to wait his turn.\n\nFor him to be a star the game should flow freely like rapids. This is against the instincts of NHL coaches who seek to control the ebb and flow of the game and remove unexpected elements in the name of _consistency._\n\nTechnically Byfield will need to change _his_ game. But tactically he should be given a chance to change _the_ game_._\n\n### The Plan\n\nHere what I suggest:\n\n-   Byfield plays the entire next season in the OHL, aiming to be the best player on the best team in the country.\n    \n-   Whichever NHL team drafts him hires an player development analyst to break down every game and a player development coach to skate with him every week.\n    \n-   Byfield does not play an NHL game until his technical mastery matches that of Malkin at age 20, his first year in Pittsburgh (85 points, Rookie of the Year).\n    \n-   In his first NHL season his KPI is the number of possessions (touches) per 60 minutes of ice time - any defensive shortcomings will only be evaluated through the prism of “is he getting enough pucks?”\n    \n\nAfter that the rest will take care of itself.\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.758382916Z","tags":null},"/reference/2020-NHL-Draft-Kasper-Smontival-The-Draft-Analyst":{"title":"","content":"\n# 2020 Draft: Top Prospects (Finland) : The Draft Analyst\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e Finland continues to produce premier NHL talent and the 2020 draft is no different.\n\nNortheastern Hockey Blog@NUHockeyBlog·February 12, 2022\n\nMetadata: \n\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](https://www.thedraftanalyst.com/2020-nhl-draft/2020-draft-top-prospects-finland/)\n\n---\nKasper Simontaival  \nRight Wing | Tappara U20, Nuorten SM-Liiga | 5’9, 177 | 1/11/02 | 41gp-20g-25a-45pts\n\n![](https://www.thedraftanalyst.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/DoRn6YyWsAEYPlK-1030x687.jpeg)\n\nSimontaival is pure offense. He’s one of the top scorers for Tappara and even produced in a small group of games in Finland’s adult-age Mestis league. He may not be the biggest kid on the ice, but Simontaival plays with intensity and is always looking to ram his offensive prowess right down his opponents’ throats. He spends a lot of time hovering near his own line in search of passes to pick off and turn into instant odd-man rushes.\n\nSimontaival has been a threat anywhere he’s played. From a top-six role in the Mestis to a first-line winger at the junior and international level, Simontaival has been able to use his quickness and attack-first mentality to generate multiple chances for himself or his linemates. Creating time and space is rarely a problem for someone with quick feet and advanced puck control like Simontaival, and his anticipation off the hop is quite high. In the last U18 5 Nations tournament, Simontaival played alongside a pair of physical forwards in 2021 draft prospect Samuel Helenius and winger Eetu Liukas, and he was actively engaged in boards battles and fought for pucks before he dished them out for one-timers or chances near the net.\n\nFrom a skating standpoint, Simontaival maintains a slightly hunched posture but can drop a quick first step. Having a low center of gravity might make one think his stride is short or choppy, but Simontaival’s stride is long and clean, and he can outpace pressure even from an equal starting point. He’s nimble and agile in tight spaces, and Simontaival is consistent in his ability to fake or juke an opponent to lean the wrong way and beat them to a spot for a clean look. He has very strong edges, and there are several stylistic comparisons to Chicago Blackhawks prospect Niklas Nordgren.\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.758382916Z","tags":null},"/reference/2022-How-LAK-Creates-Offense-Hockey-Tactics-Newsletter":{"title":"","content":"\n# How LAK Creates Offense - by Jack Han\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e The ideas behind the Kings' leap\n\nJack Han\n\nMetadata: \n\n[[2022]]\n[[The Hockey Tactics Newsletter]]\n[Original Link](https://jhanhky.substack.com/p/how-lak-creates-offense?s=r)\n\n---\n# How LAK Creates Offense\n\n### The ideas behind the Kings' leap\n\n\u003ctable class=\"meta-author-wrap with-photo alternative-meta\"\u003e\u003ctbody\u003e\u003ctr class=\"meta-author-wrap-row\"\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"account-hover-wrapper\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"user-head \"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://substack.com/profile/9301555-jack-han\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"profile-img-wrap\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_90,h_90,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e719d6-ebcc-4423-b835-333080ea4499_558x575.jpeg\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd class=\"meta-author-contents\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"meta-right-column\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"meta-author\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"account-hover-wrapper\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://substack.com/profile/9301555-jack-han\"\u003eJack Han\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ctable class=\"post-meta   custom alternative-meta\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"\u003e\u003ctbody\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd class=\"post-meta-item audience-lock\"\u003e\u003csvg role=\"img\" width=\"15.058823529411764\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 17\" fill=\"none\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke=\"#000\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" style=\"height: 16px; width: 15.0588px;\"\u003e\u003cg\u003e\u003ctitle\u003e\u003c/title\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M5 6L5 3.9C5 2.57452 6.11929 1.5 7.5 1.5C8.88071 1.5 10 2.57452 10 3.9V6\" stroke=\"#262626\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M2 7.5C2 6.94772 2.44772 6.5 3 6.5H12C12.5523 6.5 13 6.94772 13 7.5V12.5C13 13.0523 12.5523 13.5 12 13.5H3C2.44771 13.5 2 13.0523 2 12.5V7.5Z\" fill=\"#262626\" stroke=\"#262626\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/g\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd class=\"post-meta-item post-date\" title=\"2022-02-26T14:27:41.545Z\"\u003e\u003ctime datetime=\"2022-02-26T14:27:41.545Z\"\u003eFeb 26\u003c/time\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/tbody\u003e\u003c/table\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003ctable class=\"post-meta  alternative-meta custom\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"\u003e\u003ctbody\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd class=\"post-meta-item icon\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003ca href=\"javascript:void(0)\"\u003e\u003csvg role=\"img\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 22 22\" fill=\"none\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke=\"#000\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"recommend-icon post-meta-icon\" style=\"width: 16px; height: 16px;\"\u003e\u003cg\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eShare\u003c/title\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M11.6247 14.5716C6.00049 14.5716 3.41296 16.7144 1 21.0001C1.00018 11.0001 5.37535 7.42871 11.6247 7.42871\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M11.6662 1L21 11L11.6662 21\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M11.6641 14.5723L11.6641 21.0008\" stroke-linecap=\"round\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M11.6602 1L11.6602 7.42857\" stroke-linecap=\"round\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/g\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/tbody\u003e\u003c/table\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/tbody\u003e\u003c/table\u003e\n\n[\n\n![Twitter avatar for @JhanHky](https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/JhanHky.jpg)Jack Han @JhanHky\n\nLAK is gonna be good this year...](https://twitter.com/JhanHky/status/1441036676885778433?s=20\u0026t=dKyh70tmSmXy1R4TAV3lwg)[\n\nSeptember 23rd 2021\n\n6 Retweets84 Likes\n\n](https://twitter.com/JhanHky/status/1441036676885778433?s=20\u0026t=dKyh70tmSmXy1R4TAV3lwg)\n\nHeading into the 2021-22 NHL season, I was more optimistic than most about the Los Angeles Kings’ playoff chances.\n\nMicah Blake McCurdy’s HockeyViz model had LAK as [a bubble playoff team with mediocre play-driving](https://hockeyviz.com/txt/preview2122).

F3 loiters high in the zone and shades toward the strong side.\n\nThe narrowness of LAK’s 2-1-2 deters against strong-side breakouts.

He dominated his second U16 season, posting 42 goals and 20 assists through just 22 games. He played his first two games of U20 hockey in the 2017-18 season, and went on to continue to impress in the 2018-19 season with the U20 team — he recorded nine goals and 18 assists in 27 games.\n\n![Kasper Simontaival Tappara](https://thehockeywriters.com/ezoimgfmt/s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Kasper-Simontaival-Tappara.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng%3Awebp%2Fngcb57)\n\nKasper Simontaival of Tappara (Arno Hamalainen\\_)\n\nDuring the 2018-19 season, Simontaival also began playing with Tappara of the Liiga, with two assists in five games. In his pre-draft season, he played most of his games with the U20 team, totaling 25 goals and 32 assists in 48 games, but he also got in four games in the Liiga.\n\nAt the 2020 NHL Entry Draft, the Los Angeles Kings [selected Simontaival in the third round](https://thehockeywriters.com/kings-2020-draft-successes/), 66th overall. He followed that up with another season withTappara of the Liiga, scoring three goals and four assists in 30 games. He also [played at the World Junior Championship](https://thehockeywriters.com/kings-prospects-impressing-2021-wjc-preliminaries/) (WJC) for Finland, scoring at a point-per-game pace — four goals and three assists in seven games.\n\nSo far this season, Simontaival has played 18 games with KalPa of the Liiga, recording three goals and five assists.\n\n## Scouting Report\n\nSimontaival is an elite playmaker. His hockey IQ and creativity are rare, and they have carried and will carry him throughout his career. He is a great option to have in a prospect pool, as his ability to make something out of nothing is unique.\n\nSimontaival doesn’t have many downfalls. Some have struggled with his skating, but it is not a big issue by any means, and he is not as stellar defensively — an issue that comes along with his size.\n\n## NHL Projection\n\nWhile it is tough to determine where Simontaival might end up in the Kings’ lineup given their plethora of forward prospects, he could be a top-six player one day. Most of the team’s forward depth lies at center, so there is room for him on the right side. Craig Button has compared Simontaival to [Cam Atkinson](https://thehockeywriters.com/docs/cam-atkinson/). They are both smaller players — Atkinson is 5-foot-8, 176 pounds — who are offensively gifted; in his career thus far, Atkinson has scored 230 goals and 208 assists in 672 games.\n\n![Cam Atkinson, Philadelphia Flyers](https://thehockeywriters.com/ezoimgfmt/s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cam-Atkinson-Flyers-2-1200x900.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb57)\n\nCam Atkinson, Philadelphia Flyers ([Amy Irvin](https://www.facebook.com/38Photography) / The Hockey Writers)\n\nWhile it might be a stretch to say Simontaival will have a similar career, if he continues to develop as he has been and raises his defensive game to an NHL level, he could be a big part of the Kings’ future.\n\n## Quotables\n\n\u003e _Prolific goal-scorer with quick, quality hands…his shot is a legit threat…can also deliver dangerous passes._\n\u003e \n\u003e [Draftin Europe](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/397010/kasper-simontaival)\n\n\u003e He may not be the biggest kid on the ice, but Simontaival plays with intensity and is always looking to ram his offensive prowess right down his opponents’ throats.

Now he’s playing like a star\n## After years of injury issues, Kings' Gabe Vilardi is flourishing - Los Angeles Times\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e After being drafted in the first round in 2017, Kings forward Gabe Vilardi struggled with a back injury for so long that his future with the team was in doubt. Today, he leads them in goals.\n\nHelene Elliott\n\n[Original Link](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-11-02/kings-gabe-vilardi-back-injury-scoring-resurgence-anze-kopitar)\n\n---\nIt’s easy to forget, now that [Kings forward Gabriel Vilardi](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2021-02-11/nhl-kings-gabriel-vilardi-teachable-moments) is dominating entire shifts and controlling the puck as if it were magnetized to his stick, that a bad back nearly ended his career before it could truly begin.\n\nThe problems that scared some NHL teams and led him to drop from a projected top-five pick in the 2017 draft to No. 11 lingered ominously, costing him precious training time and experience. He played about 80 games — the equivalent of one NHL season — over the next three seasons, through 2019-20.\n\n“There were several months — I wouldn’t say years, but several months — where I wasn’t sure if I was going to be playing hockey for my life,” he said, “which is pretty scary because it’s all I’d ever known, all I ever wanted to do.”\n\nA big, sure-handed center in juniors, he wasn’t a great skater, but he got to the net with great success. He was expected to be a key piece of [the Kings](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey)’ rebuilding process. Instead, his continued back woes stalled his progress and he fell deeper on the organization’s depth chart each year. He seemed on the verge of becoming a bust.\n\n“With all players, you like to project and hope and all that type of stuff. But the number of setbacks he had, you wondered,” [coach Todd McLellan](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2020-01-03/fatherhood-todd-mclellan-sons-kings-fatherhood-connect-players-nhl) said. “But yet, you kept going back to the package and the skill and the talent and the brain and the hands.”\n\nWith his back no longer an issue, Vilardi, 23, has synchronized his skill, talent, exceptional ability to read the game and uncanny shooting touch. Now playing on the wing, he has been who the Kings had hoped he’d be when they drafted him: a commanding presence and impact player who brings a strong work ethic.\n\n“To tell you was there ever any doubt, we didn’t know. We do know that every time he played at \\[minor-league\\] Ontario he was a dominant player. But at the same time, it takes time,” [Kings president Luc Robitaille](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2021-06-27/stanley-cup-canadiens-elliott) said of Vilardi’s NHL trajectory.\n\n“I give the kid credit. His love for the game is the reason he’s where he’s at. You’ve got to really love what you do and not give up, and that’s one big thing about him. He’s got a passion for the game and trying to get better every day.”\n\nVilardi leads the Kings with eight goals, putting him in a four-way tie for third in the NHL behind [Edmonton superstar Connor McDavid](https://www.nhl.com/player/connor-mcdavid-8478402) and San Jose defenseman Erik Karlsson. Vilardi has scored three more goals than he did in 25 games last season, and he’s two short of the career-high 10 he scored in 54 games in 2020-21. He shares the team scoring lead with Kevin Fiala at 13 points each.\n\n“The kid was good at training camp. He was good last year at training camp too. He’s had good spurts,” Robitaille said. “I think he’s earned his ice time by the way he’s played and what he’s shown. I’m really happy for him, I’ve got to tell you.”\n\nPromoted to the first line with [Anze Kopitar](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2021-05-06/column-1-000-point-milestone-reaffirms-kopitar-as-one-of-l-a-s-most-accomplished-athletes) and [Adrian Kempe](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-07-10/kings-adrian-kempe-agree-4-year-22-million-dollar-extension) last Saturday, Vilardi scored what held up as the game-winner against Toronto when he took a pass from Kopitar and flicked a shot over the goalie’s left shoulder. He also won three of four faceoffs and was an effective net-front presence on the Kings’ first goal, by Kempe.\n\n ![A  goaltender crouches as the Kings' Gabriel Vilardi sweeps in from the side of the net.](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/54428df/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5509x3673+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F68%2Fb1%2F20d6d2844ee4aae1cf7cbba8e479%2Fkings-blues-hockey-15736.jpg)\n\nKings forward Gabriel Vilardi controls the puck against the Blues and goaltender Thomas Greiss on Monday in St. Louis.\n\n(Jeff Roberson / Associated Press)\n\nVilardi followed that on Monday at St. Louis by scoring the first goal in a [5-1 rout of the Blues](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-10-31/kings-blues-nhl-recap), forcing a turnover in the defensive zone and dashing up ice to finish off a passing play during a six-on-five manpower advantage. That goal, in his 100\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e NHL game, extended his goal streak to a career-best four straight games. He set up Kopitar for the Kings’ third goal, off a dazzling give-and-go, to record his fifth multi-point game this season.\n\nHis scoring streak ended on Tuesday when he was shut out in the [Kings’ 5-2 loss at Dallas](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-11-01/kings-vs-dallas-stars-nhl-recap), but his shooting percentage remains a healthy 25.8%, with eight goals on 31 shots.\n\nLast week, Kopitar said Vilardi had been the Kings’ best player “hands down,” which was no exaggeration. Like others in the organization, Kopitar had seen Vilardi in training camp or during occasional stretches in the lineup and hoped the kid could shake off his injury woes long enough to fulfill his immense promise.\n\n“I remember his skill is through the roof. He’s got to be top in the league in handling the puck in tight spaces. He’s displayed it. And he very rarely loses a stick battle,” Kopitar said. “I knew his skill was always there. His hockey IQ is very exceptional. Yeah, he’s just had a couple bad years with some injuries and we always talk about confidence, which couldn’t have been very high.\n\n“He’s come to camp with a mission and, like I said, he’s been our best player.”\n\nNo one had to tell Vilardi that training camp was a make-or-break moment for him. He knew he had used up a lot of chances and that the Kings had stockpiled talented young forwards in recent drafts.\n\n“I think I had more to prove this year,” he said. “I stay off social media because I don’t like to read it, but I don’t know who was counting me on the team this year, on the starting roster. I just worked hard this summer and I’m just taking the same mentality that I had this summer into the season, and so far it’s been good. But it’s a small sample size. I want to be a good player for a long time.”\n\nThat means he must take constant care of his back. “I don’t want to say it was a blessing in disguise, because I missed three years and that’s a lot of development, a lot of hockey that I missed,” he said, “but I do have a better sense of my body, I think.”\n\nFinally, he’s getting a chance to be the player the Kings believed he could become. He believes it now too. “They drafted me to be a goal scorer or produce or help put up points,” he said. “It’s what I’ve always wanted to do and it’s good I’m kind of doing it. I’ve got to produce. That’s my job, at the end of the day.”\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.758382916Z","tags":null},"/reference/ATKM-2022-Draft-Scouting-Left-Handed-Defensemen-w-Will-Scouch-2022-06-06":{"title":"","content":"ATKM - 2022 Draft Scouting (Left Handed Defensemen) w Will Scouch - 2022-06-06\n\nhttps://all-the-kings-men.simplecast.com/episodes/2022-draft-scouting-left-handed-defensemen-w-will-scouch-wflFle3w\n\n### EPISODE SUMMARY\n\nThe 2022 NHL Entry Draft takes place July 7th and 85h in Montreal.

Experience is the only path to enlightenment. And, “until you do both,” he said, “you really don’t know what you’re into until you live it for a little while.”\n\nIt’s a fundamental truth that has shaped McLellan, the man in charge of reshaping the rebuilding Kings. Though his sons, 23-year-old Tyson and 20-year-old Cale, are out of the house, their influence on McLellan — a widely praised hire after the club finished last season in last place in the Western Conference — continues to loom large.\n\n“Coaching prepared me to be a father,” he said. “Fatherhood has helped me adapt as we go forward into the coaching world.\n\n“Times have changed. We have to change with them. \\[My sons\\] keep me current with those types of things.”\n\nMcLellan’s professional path has long been intertwined with parenthood. Tyson, now playing his senior season of college hockey at Denver University, and Cale, a student at the University of Colorado, were both born while their dad was coaching in juniors.\n\nThe boys were school-aged by the time he reached the NHL as an assistant in Detroit in 2005. They spent most of their teenage years in San Jose, where McLellan was the head coach of the Sharks from 2008 to 2015.\n\nWhen the boys were old enough, McLellan would let them tag along to work. Tyson remembers sitting in on McLellan’s coaching meetings as a kid. Cale helped out the Sharks’ equipment staff for a couple years, placing him near the end of the bench and within earshot of his dad during games.\n\nAs they learned from him, he was keenly observing them too.\n\nIn school, for instance, McLellan quickly realized his boys interacted with teachers in a way he never did.\n\n“They have courage to reach out to a teacher and challenge a grade on a paper,” he recalled. “I would have never done that. I would have taken, ‘This is the grade I got. That’s what I earned. Away we go.’ But they’re willing to put themselves out there and say, ‘Hey, what about this? Why do you think this wasn’t like this?’ ”\n\n ![Denver forward Tyson McLellan chases the puck during a game against Arizona State on Dec. 7, 2019.](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/68ca9ee/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3840x2160+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F26%2F0b%2Fceb6399749e58a6a5652789bd23e%2Fap-19342136116884.jpg)\n\n(Rick Scuteri / Associated Press)\n\nAt home, McLellan watched how his sons spent their spare time: how hours on a phone or computer didn’t diminish their dedication in school or sports, and how being raised in the Internet age influenced their thoughts, their motivations.\n\n“He was always looking to see what drives us as a younger generation, what gets to us,” said Tyson, recalling how during summer trips to the family’s home in Kelowna, Canada, McLellan would play Spikeball with his sons and their friends, sit with them while they watched hockey and talked about the game, or simply razz them lounging around the house.\n\nSaid Cale: “If you ask any of my friends, they’d laugh. He’s always there. He’s always chirpin’ Tyson and I. He likes to be in that mix. He’s soaking up how we interact with each other, you know. How we live.”\n\nMcLellan learned from the hard days, such as when Tyson was suspended from school in the fourth grade along with some of his friends for teasingly tripping each other with Hula Hoops. He also cherished the rewarding ones.\n\nTyson left home at 16 to pursue a junior hockey career and, three years later, earned a spot on Denver’s Division I team. Cale quit the family sport at age 10 — “It took a lot of courage for him to do that,” Todd McLellan said — and began trying to develop cellphone apps as a senior in high school.\n\n\u003e “He does a really good job of knowing when guys need a pat and some confidence, or a kick in the butt.”\n\n— Kings forward Blake Lizotte\n\nAs they got older, McLellan started seeing his sons’ traits in some of his younger players: the inquisitive minds and insatiable need for more information, the heightened internal drives despite dwindling attention spans.\n\n“That’s how it works in the locker room,” McLellan said. “They don’t want an hour of meeting. They don’t want 30 clips in a video session. They want to see themselves. They want to see themselves doing it right sometimes. They want to see it where they need adjustments. But they want it to the point and quick. Being around the kids, that’s where you figure that part out.”\n\nIt’s all reflected in the style with which he coaches the Kings. McLellan preaches the importance of compassion and clarity, honesty and understanding. He can be the heavy, but has found a light touch to be just as effective. And as more players of his sons’ generation trickle into the league, the more relevant those new-age nuances become.\n\n“He does a really good job of knowing when guys need a pat and some confidence, or a kick in the butt,” said rookie forward Blake Lizotte, one of 11 players on the Kings’ roster with less than three full NHL seasons of experience. “The new up-and-coming coaches are a lot more like that, a lot more relational and are able to communicate really well instead of the old, standoff-ish, yell-when-you-make-mistakes \\[style\\].”\n\nEven as he approaches 30 years in the coaching profession, McLellan has adopted new lines of thinking to adapt to a new generation of players.\n\n ![Kings coach Todd McLellan talks to his players during a preseason game in September.](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/34d34cd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2417x1528+0+0/resize/1200x759!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F52%2F12%2F8398931a4843b0a0eae7f42581e7%2Fcoyotes-kings-hockey-74033.jpg)\n\n(Marcio Jose Sanchez / Associated Press)\n\n“I understand exactly what he’s saying,” said 35-year-old forward Dustin Brown, the Kings’ longest-tenured player and a father of four. “I look at my teammates differently now. Not that they act like children, but you have a better understanding of where they’re at, what they’re thinking, how they’re thinking. You learn a lot. I’ve always said, I learn way more from my kids than they learn from me.”\n\nNow that McLellan’s sons have finally entered adulthood, he has inherited a Kings team in the adolescence of a reboot. After seven playoff appearances and two Stanley Cup championships in a nine-year stretch between 2010-2018, the Kings have the fewest total points of any Western Conference team since the start of last season and are likely headed toward a second straight season missing the playoffs.\n\nUnlike his past jobs with the Sharks (where he missed the playoffs once in seven years) and Edmonton Oilers (where he coached arguably the best player in the game in Connor McDavid), McLellan signed a five-year contract with the Kings understanding this job would take more time to get right.\n\n“This team has gone through the whole process, and now we’re back to putty and we’re trying to mold it again,” he said. “It doesn’t happen as quick. You’re a little more patient.”\n\nOnce again, he goes back to his sons. When they were young, he points out, the process was more important than the results. He could live with bad grades. He could accept if they didn’t make a team. Back then, it was about building good habits, cementing a solid structure. They were building for the future — just as the Kings are now.\n\n ![Denver forward Tyson McLellan skates during a game against Arizona State on Dec. 7.](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5951fb3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3841x2160+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F02%2F35%2F47a62719477abf9b42ba886e851c%2Fap-19342136028175.jpg)\n\n(Rick Scuteri / Associated Press)\n\n“That’s part of the plan, is to set standards and create expectations amongst each other in the locker room,” McLellan said, slipping on his coach’s hat. “Apply it in the game. Make mistakes. Correct them. And grow. So later on, we can take advantage of all the training we’ve had.”\n\nAfter all, it worked for him as a father. Tyson is an alternate captain with a Denver team that reached the Frozen Four last year. Cale is in charge of multiple start-up companies, most notably a food-delivery app called “9-Eighteen” that is being used by several golf courses and resorts in Canada.\n\n“I think that’s what Tyson and Cale are doing in college,” McLellan said. “Because my wife and I were there helping them through elementary and high school, and checking their papers and making sure they’re doing their homework. They’re ready now.”\n\nMcLellan thinks his Kings team is on a similarly ascendant path. Just as he couldn’t rush his sons to adulthood, he can’t skip through the transitional phase with his new team. His lessons from fatherhood have never been as relatable at the rink. His boys are grown now. He is ready to raise a hockey team of his own.\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.758382916Z","tags":null},"/reference/Final-MediaScout-Poll-for-the-2017-NHL-Draft":{"title":"Final MediaScout Poll for the 2017 NHL Draft","content":"\n# Final MediaScout Poll for the 2017 NHL Draft\n\n# OHL Prospects: Final Media/Scout Poll for the 2017 NHL Draft\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e The NHL draft is now only a few weeks away, so it's time to conclude our yearly media/scout poll.

Matthew Strome is the guy who has really fallen off, going from 4th in November, to 6th in February, to just outside the top 10 in June. Ottawa's Sasha Chmelevski has had a similar slide due to consistency issues. He received 12 votes for the Top 10 in November. Then 7 votes in February. Then zero votes in June. If we look at some of the \"risers,\" Robert Thomas in London stands out. He received a single vote (from NACS's Mark Seidel) in November. But has firmly entrenched himself in the Top 10 since and looks like a potential top 25 pick come the end of the month. With his play in the OHL playoffs and down the stretch, Jason Robertson has really elevated his status in the eyes of scouts too, despite some skating concerns. He got only two votes for the Top 10 in February, but in June he finds himself on the majority of lists and firmly placed inside the top 6 as a potential first round pick.\n\nSimilar to last year, there are a lot of faces on this list, which speaks volumes to the high end depth that the OHL has to offer this year. 19 names received consideration for the Top 10. As I've said before, when all is said and done, it wouldn't shocked me at all if the OHL has one third of the players taken inside the first two or three rounds.\n\nAs always, these lists wouldn't be possible without the contributions of the voters.

Gabriel Vilardi - Forward - Windsor Spitfires**  \nTotal Votes: 18  \nHigh/Low Ranking: 1st (14x)/2nd (4x)  \nComments:  \n\"While he may “figure it out”, the question remains whether he will ever improve his skating enough to play as a center in the NHL. Windsor’s coaching staff wasn’t comfortable using Vilardi in the middle this season even after Logan Brown was sidelined with several injuries. If Vilardi already has problems playing a defensive role at center in junior, it’s anybody’s guess whether he will ever improve his speed enough to do so at the pro level.\" - Grant McCagg\n\n\"Big powerful kid that can make subtle plays or run right through you, his feet are an issue but he has taken a big jump from the beginning of the year, great Memorial Cup showed that this kid can step up, may not be the best in 3 years but look back after 8 and he will be.\" - Mark Seidel\n\n\"Windsor coach Rocky Thompson told me that when it comes to charting the success of Vilardi, there was one common denominator and that was Vilardi is the engine on the team because whoever plays with him, their Corsi or puck possession numbers go through the roof. Without him, they dropped significantly. That's the type of player Vilardi has become. Yes, he'll need to improve his skating but he's a three-zone player with good size (6-3, 201) and he works hard down low. Has a relentless motor.\" - Mike Morreale\n\n\"A top offensive catalyst for the Memorial Cup Champs this season, early on in the season he had some issues with injury/illness but put those behind him and looked very effective as a big bodied power forward in the Joe Thornton playmaking mold. The vision and puck creativity he has with his playmaking mesh really well with his smart ability to drive the net and protect the puck in possession utilizing his size advantage, buying time for his teammates to get into position. He has top line potential with just some marginal improvement needed in his skating to reach his upside.\" - Dan Stewart  \n**2\\. Owen Tippett - Forward - Mississauga Steelheads**  \nTotal Votes: 18  \nHigh/Low Ranking: 1st (4x)/4th (2x)  \nComments:  \n\"I'm not sure when Tippett will go, because there is a huge variance in how teams view him. But there are true believers out there and they made a pretty good case to me about how his weakness (defense) can be cured with coaching, while his strengths (speed, shot, goal-scoring) cannot be taught.\" - Ryan Kennedy\n\n\"Was first at midseason and did nothing to change my mind now. He was especially impressive in the OHL Finals against Erie taking over stretches of games by himself showing off his top-end speed and skill. Should be gone in the top-5 come draft night.\" - Mark Scheig\n\n\"People seem to be jumping on the nitpick bandwagon with arguably the 2017 draft’s top goal scoring prospect. Tippett is a bulldozer on skates with excellent speed, a heavy, accurate shot that he shoots off the pass and is tough to knock off the puck. He is deadly off the rush but he’s smart enough to get open and wire it with a quick release. Getting top-six minutes at the highest level is in his future, and the team that drafts him should salivate at the thought of Tippett using his quickness and strength to exploit the shrinking NHL defenseman.\" - Steve Kournianos\n\n\"NHL ready shot right now. Continues to work on other aspects of his game. Had some great games in the OHL final against Erie. If he brought it like he did in those games all the time, scouts would feel more certain with this pick.\" - Tony Ambrogio\n\n**3\\. Nick Suzuki - Forward - Owen Sound Attack**  \nTotal Votes: 18  \nHigh/Low Ranking: 2nd (4x)/4th (3x)  \nComments:  \n\"The kid that most expected to be a solid 200 foot player has shown incredible offensive instincts, wants to be the best player he can be, smart, sneaky in the offensive end, reminds me of Bryan Little in his year.\" - Mark Seidel\n\n¨Underestimated OHL star terrorized the league with his dazzling array of jukes and creative exploits with the puck…incredible one-on-one attacker who has a sneaky quality about him where he also finds himself on a lot of breakaways…a pure finisher who is a playmaker in the truest sense of the word…he doesn’t even know how powerful of a shooter he is, but hammers the puck because he lives to score...linear speed is generally good with its highs and lows…strides can refine with strength and become tighter...the beauty of his work is that it’s imperfect and sometimes choppy, but explosive, exciting, and effective...not immune to inconsistency and going MIA because he’s also not a physical player...we may be seeing a recalculation on this type of player league wide at the draft, which means he should be off the board by pick 15.\" - Anthony Mauro\n\n\"Suzuki is a player who has really earned my respect as the season has progressed. He's still a few years from becoming a regular in the NHL, in my opinion, but boy do I like what he has to offer. His coach at Owen Sound, Ryan McGill, told me Suzuki reminds him a lot of Mikael Backlund of the Calgary Flames and he could one day be a second-line center in the NHL. What I like about Suzuki is his ability in the clutch. He scored 14 power-play goals, 6 game winners, 5 shorthanded goals, and 23 of his 45 goals this season gave Owen Sound the lead or tied the game.\" - Mike Morreale\n\n\"Spoke to someone who saw Suzuki play in his bantam days. Says that if I would have told him back then that Suzuki would have been the highest scoring player of this age group a year removed from the priority draft, he would have called me crazy. Bottom line is this. He was one of the most improved players from bantam to minor midget. He's been one of the most improved players in the OHL this year. He just keeps getting better every year. His work ethic is outstanding. And with his hockey sense, you have to wonder just how much more he's going to continue to grow as a player when the physical qualities (size, speed, strength) get better.\" - Brock Otten\n\n**4\\. Robert Thomas - Forward - London Knights**  \nTotal Votes: 17  \nHigh/Low Ranking: 2nd (1x)/Outside of the Top 10 (1x)  \nComments:  \n\"There is no junior hockey coach more respected than London’s Dale Hunter, so when he uses a draft-eligible center in all important situations, scouts won’t have to dig too deeply into that player’s character or deeply question his hockey sense. By the playoffs Thomas may well have been London’s top forward - certainly in terms of ice time, surpassing Cliff Pu as Hunter’s go-to center on a line with Janne Kuokkanen and Mitchell Stephens.\" - Grant McCagg\n\n¨Dating back to his York Simcoe minor midget days, Thomas has always impressed me. A gifted player who has a tremendous feel for the game, he is the type of player who processes the game quick and dissects defences with high intelligence level. He's not the flashiest player yet he always impresses with his ability to create from nothing, maximizing the time and/or space afforded to him. Extremely talented in tight quarters, Thomas displays crafty handling control and can deliver difficult passes with precision. He's a very efficient player who elevates the play of his teammates through smart puck management. As he adopts more responsibility in his draft plus one season, look for Thomas to surge up the OHL scoring charts. He was consistently one of London's best forwards on a nightly basis regardless of his ice time Personally, I am higher on Thomas than most and think he should be considered for selection in the 11-15th range.¨ - Brendan Ross\n\n\"It's an easy comparison to say he reminds me of Bo Horvat in that he constantly got better and can play up and down the lineup, very high IQ, has learned a lot from Dale Hunter and will be a key player on a winning team.\" - Mark Seidel\n\n\"Thomas is an interesting prospect that comes from a solid program that develops skilled, but smart players, the London Knights. Thomas’s best attribute is his high IQ based on his understanding of reading plays and knowing when to react at the exact moment he can create a competitive advantage for his team on both ends of the ice. With the puck, Thomas does not rush plays he knows will turn the puck over, as an example he will drop the puck back to his defenseman if he is pushed to the boards. Away from the puck Thomas is a great interceptor of the puck as he closes off passing lanes to the point opponents don’t want to play around him. It doesn’t hurt that he is also a fast skater in all three zones and possesses strong puck handling abilities that he uses to move around the offensive zone. Making light of his offense Thomas was one of the best two-way Centre in the OHL, understanding the 411 on back check while also understanding to shift from back checking to defensive zone coverage around his opponents.\" - Scott Crawford\n\n**5\\. Nic Hague - Defense - Mississauga Steelheads**  \nTotal Votes: 16  \nHigh/Low Ranking: 3rd (3x)/Outside of the Top 10 (2x)  \nComments:  \n\"His strengths include his obvious size and reach but also his powerful shot and willingness to play a physical brand of shutdown defense. Sure he has his deficiencies, but they are all areas that will be addressed and improved upon. I am not sure why people have fallen out of love with this big six-foot-six behemoth who has decent speed and plays a real strong two-way game. He might not have great offensive upside at the NHL level but he has more potential than Windsor's Logan Stanley did and many of the same scouts that have dropped Hague down had Stanley in their top ten rankings.\" - Dan Stewart\n\n\"Great combination of skill and size. Has a better offensive game than some people give him credit for. Once he figures out how to use his size to his advantage, watch out. Still growing into his body.\" - Tony Ambrogio\n\n\"Hague showed himself very well in the OHL Finals against Erie. He played Alex DeBrincat tough at times, while providing a calming influence on the blueline. He should be the first OHL defenseman off the board given what all he brings to the table.\" - Mark Scheig\n\n\"Hague beats all draft-eligible OHL defenseman when it comes to upside and top-pairing potential.  He’s obviously got the size, but his booming shot and an improving defensive game are two more reasons why people need to start taking him seriously as a possible lottery pick. He has a nasty side to his game, and staying within himself is one of only a few areas he could stand to improve upon. Hague is mobile and physical, and his strong one-on-one play in the second half earned him critical late-game responsibilities.\" - Steve Kournianos\n\n**6\\. Jason Robertson - Forward - Kingston Frontenacs**  \nTotal Votes: 17  \nHigh/Low Ranking: 4th (3x)/Outside of the Top 10 (1x)  \nComments:  \n\"There is no one player on this list who scored more relative to his teammates than Robertson. The Kingston Frontenacs were a wasteland for offensive talent this year and Robertson carried them with 42 goals (16 more than his next closest teammate), 39 assists (tied for the team lead), and 81 points (30 more than his next closest teammate). Most scouts would probably want a winger of Robertson’s size to be more physical, but it's his finesse that distinguishes him. For a player who doesn’t overwhelm as a skater or shooter, Robertson is damn good.\" - Scott Wheeler\n\n\"Hockey IQ and goal scoring will drive Jason Robertson to the NHL, able to adapt and adjust his game to whoever is put on his line, Robertson is a chameleon on ice, able to effortlessly slip defensive coverage and scoring lanes. A contributor on special teams, both PP and PK makes him another very versatile player coming out of the OHL that NHL teams will covet.\" - Reed Duthie\n\n\"Has a great touch around the net and has good hockey sense. He accounted for 45.3 percent of Kingston's offense, scoring 42 goals. I think he might be the most improved player from start to finish in the OHL. He's 6-2, 182 pounds and knows how to protect the puck and has a shoot-first mentality, as evidenced by the fact he finished third in the OHL with 301 shots on goal.\" - Mike Morreale\n\n\"If his average speed wasn’t so obvious, Robertson might have been a lock for the top five. He had an outstanding season for Kingston, leading the Frontenacs in both regular season and playoff scoring. His soft hands and quick release helped him tally 42 goals in 68 games — 29 at even strength — but he is far from a garbage-goal scorer. Robertson is a smart winger who not only knows where to position himself, but how to remain there regardless of the beating he’s taking.\" - Steve Kournianos\n\n**7\\. Isaac Ratcliffe - Forward - Guelph Storm**  \nTotal Votes: 15  \nHigh/Low Ranking: 3rd (1x)/Outside of the Top 10 (3x)  \nComments:  \n\"Big Ratcliffe has been one of my favorite guys to track this season as he has big upside potential but also a ways to climb to reach his ceiling. His size and eventual strength will be an asset making him hard to handle anywhere close to the net or along the walls at the NHL level and his skating and shot have improved dramatically making him an danger to score off the rush.\" - Dan Stewart\n\n\"This guy just screams off the board pick in the first round. I had him going 17th to Toronto in my mock draft and if he went higher than that, I wouldn't be shocked. Massive kid who's already a strong net presence who possesses one of the better shots in the age group. As he fills out, the potential is quite high. The million dollar question for me is, are the inconsistencies (especially physically) due to a lack of strength, or a lack of sense and desire? Could easily be an Eric Daze type of player if everything falls into place.\" - Brock Otten\n\n\"Ratcliffe is an intriguing big man with a lot of upside to his game. Standing at 6’5 Ratcliffe is a physical specimen that plays a controlled physical game that causes opponents to be weary of what he is going to do in their own end. His big frame allows him to have great puck possession numbers when he is controlling the puck in the offensive zone.  Puck moving abilities are his best skill because his big body and long stick can move at a fast pace that opposing forwards find difficult to take away or challenge. One area of improvement Ratcliffe needs to make is his skating as his edge work is decent, but his strides slow the momentum of his team’s offensive rush. Ratcliffe deserves to be in the first round because it’s often rare to find a big player like him that can move the puck around the ice with his stick so quickly.\" - Scott Crawford\n\n¨Skinny skyscraper has had a rollercoaster of a development track over the last few years that stabilised right at the start of this past winter…announced his arrival with a package of long legs, quick stick, and fairly strong skating…knows what to do with the puck and is looked upon as an offensive leader in Guelph…his shot is a standout characteristic and just like his skating patterns is not easy to read…can snap top shelf moving, blast it from stand still, take it to the net and beat the goalie – point is he’s not a one trick pony…above average pass reception that extends plays and is a safety blanket for teammates a notch below in talent…nice stickhandler who has room to grow...needs to work on becoming less disconnected and loose defensively…somewhere in between Logan Brown and Riley Tufte as a comparison…massively underdeveloped tower found a way to be a scorer on a bad team and based on data is less of a projection pick than you would think.¨ - Anthony Mauro\n\n**8\\. Conor Timmins - Defense - Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds**  \nTotal Votes: 15  \nHigh/Low Ranking: 5th (4x)/Outside of the Top 10 (3x)  \nComments:  \n\"One of the oldest players of this year's draft class (born Sept. 18, 1998), Timmins has high-end hockey sense and is excellent at transitioning the puck out of his zone. He's very poised and can run a power play, has a good shot and earned his role as a top-pair defenseman for the Greyhounds.\" - Mike Morreale\n\n\"Great puck moving defenceman who does a fantastic job of avoiding the forecheck in the defensive zone which gives him extra time to start the breakout. ES beast as he finished 2nd among OHL defensemen in even strength points.\" - Peter Kneulman\n\n\"He is the best two-way defenseman to be taken in the draft and who will make any coach happy to coach him. He listens and is a great teammate for anyone that plays on his line. His skating is unique for a defenseman and allows him to drive more to the net and make good plays up ice. When he is skating up the ice he usually is not a pass first type of defenseman as he will charge down the ice with the puck entering the zone as the F1 either dumping the puck in or taking a quick shot on net. His skating is what makes him a valuable defenseman due to his ability to recover when offense turns to defense and he is mobile on the back pedal when an opposing offensive rush is penetrating his zone and he will always be ready to close the gap. He is on the right track in his development to become a first round draft pick and thanks to his hard work and commitment to being a better player he has branded his own style of play.\" - Scott Crawford\n\n\"Timmins is on the older side of this draft class, which contributed to his success as a draft-eligible, but he remains a top prospect in his own right. Even if you extend scoring among OHL defenders to all under-19 skaters, Timmins finished second with 61 points and a 0.91 points per game clip, ahead of last year’s top prospects, including Mikhail Sergachyov, Olli Juolevi and Victor Mete. He led a strong Sault Ste. Marie team to the top of the division and he did it while driving play and dictating possession in all situations.\" - Scott Wheeler\n\n**9\\. Michael Dipietro - Goaltender - Windsor Spitfires**  \nTotal Votes: 10  \nHigh/Low Ranking: 4th (1x)/Outside of the Top 10 (8x)  \nComments:  \n\"One can only hope this backstop with cat-like quickness ends this seemingly decades-long trend that goalies need to be a certain height to succeed. Listed at 6 feet tall, DiPietro is a tremendous competitor with impeccable positioning and net awareness, and both were on display as he led the host Spitfires to a perfect record at the Memorial Cup, including a pair of stellar wins against Erie’s powerful offense.\" - Steve Kournianos\n\n\"The best goaltending prospect the OHL has seen in several years (better than Malcolm Subban was for sure and he was a first rounder). If he were 6'3, we'd be talking about him as a potential lottery pick (even as a goalie). We know about the athleticism and his ability to make remarkable saves. But what many people don't know is how amazing this kid is as a human being. Lost his mother at a young age and carries himself like a true professional. Someone who has coached him told me that he's one of the best kids he's ever coached and that his work ethic is second to none. As Toronto Blue Jays starter Marcus Stroman has famously stated, \"height doesn't measure heart.\" - Brock Otten\n\n\"The best goalie in the draft despite his size limitations, very good feet, tracks pucks well, reads the play, plays big in big games, mentally strong.\" - Mark Seidel\n\n\"The OHL's prized draft eligible goaltender for 2017 and Memorial Cup champion could be even higher on my list here but for the reason I have been fooled before by an OHL goaltender who I thought was a sure thing NHL starter, thanks for that shot to the confidence Thomas McCollum.

However, The main issue with Frost’s game concerns his defensive game, and there are some scouts who wonder if at his size he will be able to handle larger top-two centers in an NHL setting and opine that he may end up being a playmaking winger on an offensive line.\" - Grant McCagg\n\n\"Very underrated 2-way player. Dynamite on the power play. Has shown steady growth at even strength and should see a spike next year as he adds speed and strength in the offseason.\" - Peter Kneulman\n\n\"Frost, like London's Thomas, doesn't get the credit he deserves while being surrounding by a very talented team in Sault Ste. Marie. Coming off his 1st 20 goal OHL season, he is taking a development curve very similar to that of teammate/linemate Zachary Senyshyn. A different player from Senyshyn though, its Frost's passing and vision that will WOW scouts and he should only continue this improve.\" - Reed Duthie\n\n\"Every time I saw him he got better. Really smart player away from the puck. Has an edge to his game you can't teach.\" - Tony Ambrogio\n\n**Honorable Mentions**\n\n**Matthew Strome - Forward - Hamilton Bulldogs (7 Votes)**  \nHighest Ranking: 7th (3x)  \nComments:  \n\"Sniper's hands with a coach's mind. Matt Strome is a hockey savant, when you talk to the Bulldogs forward about game plans, opposition tendencies, and how to break down opposition its as if the game is happening right in front of him on a screen. After debuting with 16 goals in 15-16, Strome took his production to the next level in 16-17 with 34 goals and 28 assists while continuing to be a force both on the power play and shorthanded. With the man advantage Strome can use his incredible hand eye coordination infront of the net or his hockey IQ to play the high boards in the umbrella set up making him a threat in multiple locations. Improving his skating stride and top speed will be paramount challenge but with Strome's work ethic he's more then up to the challenge.\" - Reed Duthie\n\n\"This big and strong playmaking winger who also works his tail off has much upside but also some deficiencies that will scare some teams away. His size, strength and vision combo is impressive but if he can not improve his feet and quickness they might all be for not. The good news is that his brothers also had mobility issues but have since made big strides, pun intended.\" - Dan Stewart\n\n\"Admittedly number 11 on my list, but I don't question anyone who has Strome in their top 10 because of how close players ranked 8 through 10 are. These are all guys who have a shot to be top 45 picks come June. Everyone talks about how bad Strome's skating is. And it seems like he's only generated negative press lately (especially after a poor U18's). But he's a solid prospect and deserves respect for the things he does well. His mention in the OHL Coaches Poll as one of the smartest players in the Conference it a testament to his ability to create offensive scoring chances for his linemates. He has terrific vision and patience for a bigger player. The offensive upside is most certainly there. The U18's proved how his skating limits him right now (playing on the big ice). But IMO, the key to his development might be the increased consistency of his physical game. He's never going to be a top notch skater, but he can still be an NHL top 6 player if he can continue to harness the power forward game that he flashes from time to time.\" - Brock Otten \n\n**Ivan Lodnia - Forward - Erie Otters (5 Votes)**  \nHighest Ranking: 5th (1x)  \nComments:  \n\"Although his numbers don't show it, Lodnia is a vastly improved two-way player. With the Otters deep on their top-six, Lodnia played on the third and fourth line in a defensive role and did well with it. When given the opportunity, he's dangerous with the puck on his stick. With all of Erie's departures next season, Lodnia jumps straight to the top line and will have more of a chance to show what he can do.\" - Mark Scheig\n\n\"A personal favourite of mine because of the offensive upside he possesses. Puck skills are among the best available and his skating and hustle improved this year.\" - Anonymous\n\n\"Lodnia managed to net 57 points in 66 games despite suffering the misfortune of playing behind the Otters’ top line that combined for 130 goals. He’s got a wicked shot, and his strength on the puck is evident every time he hits the ice. Two undervalued aspects of his game are his poise and hockey sense – this kid under pressure is as cool as a cucumber and can lure opponents well out of position. Lodnia, who missed 2018 eligibility by two weeks, was deadly for Team USA at the Ivan Hlinka, and Erie’s expected exodus of graduating superstars makes him primed for a breakout season in 2018.\" - Steve Kournianos\n\n\"The fact he has been able to take on a shutdown role with the veteran Otters is a big checkmark. We know he can produce offense and next year he'll be back in a plum scoring role, so Lodnia's in a really good situation.\" - Ryan Kennedy  \n**Alex Formenton - Forward - London Knights (4 Votes)**  \nHighest Ranking: 9th (1x)  \nComments:  \n\"Formenton is one of those prospects that impresses scouts a lot more the first time he’s seen live than when they watch him on video or look at the stats sheet, predominantly because it soon becomes apparent just how fast he moves around the rink. His skating skills and size combo alone will likely get him picked in the top 50, and perhaps even in the top 40.\" - Grant McCagg\n\n¨He made a significant contribution in his first OHL season for the Knights. He's a strong 200-foot player with good size and excellent skating ability. He can execute skilled plays at top speed and generate scoring opportunities off the rush or below the dots.¨ - Mike Morreale\n\n\"I've been up and down on Formenton all season. And I wonder if NHL scouts feel the same way. Just like some London Knights from past drafts, his wavering ice time really made it difficult to properly scout him this year. The speed is noticeable every single game, and every time he touches the ice. But the offensive game really is hard to peg. At times, it looks like his feet are moving faster than his brain and he out-skates himself out of scoring chances. And for a player who's so quick, the consistency of his play away from the puck needs to improve IMO. Even with limited ice time, I want to notice him and I didn't the majority of times I saw London in the second half and playoffs. But you also have to trust the London Knights program and the way they develop prospects. If there is a team who can harness his goal scoring potential and ability to utilize his speed as a weapon in all three zones, it's London.\" - Brock Otten\n\n**Jonah Gadjovich - Forward - Owen Sound Attack (4 Votes)**  \nHighest Ranking: 8th (2x)  \nComments:  \n¨The most improved player in the Ontario Hockey League this past season, Gadjovich picked the perfect time to have his coming out party. A late '98 birthdate allowed the Whitby native to develop his confidence and his astonishing 46 goals blew scouts away - more than tripling his sophomore production. He's a strong sturdy player who has a knack for finding his way to the net and a timely ability to cash in on pucks with his quick shooting ability. While he leaves some room for improvement in terms of his speed and natural puck skills, he does display smarts and strong positioning that allow him to be a factor on many plays, and support his line mates well. His work ethic helps him maximize his power forward style of play because he's shows a willingness to get his hands dirty to earn his chances. Come draft day, Gadjovich should start receiving interest anytime near the end of the first round and likely landing in a second round position at the end of the day.¨ - Brendan Ross\n\n¨Young OHL veteran has nearly 200 games played yet has been under the radar as a power forward shooting maniac…most attribute his production to stud 2017 Nick Suzuki, but make no mistake, he is every part the competent half as the quintessential shotgun winger…a simple forward who doesn’t over-complicate the game…if he had a motto it would be play physical and shoot a lot...often gets his way physically and has detail around the crease that some pro’s can’t dream of…has very good straight line speed and an explosive first few strides despite being filled out like a grown man and 200 plus pounds at 18…agility is average and not the most natural puck handler in flight….overall has decent, working class hands that get the job done…will shoot from everywhere and anywhere and can really put his weight into his shots…we all want highlight reel plays and incessant puck dragging, but everything about this minimal kid screams he will be a better pro than junior and he’s already pretty damn good.¨ - Anthony Mauro\n\n\"Love this player. He's a real throwback. Loved him in his rookie year, but he did struggle last year. This year, he got better and better every month. The skating concerns are overblown IMO. I think that area really saw improvement as the year went on. He knows his role on the ice is to be a net presence and he's an absolute beast there; an impossible tie up for many OHL defenders. But he's also a very smart two-way player who is a coaches dream. That combination should definitely make him an NHL player IMO.\" - Brock Otten\n\n**Mackenzie Entwistle - Forward - Hamilton Bulldogs (3 Votes)**  \nHighest Ranking: 8th (1x)  \nComments:  \n\"This big forward is smart and willing to use his strengths to his advantage. He needs to fill out still but you love that he uses what strength he has to play a physical game. He is also an impressive skater, reads the play well, makes smart decisions and contributes in all facets. The one area that keeps him down the list is his lack of offensive upside.\" - Dan Stewart\n\n\"One of my personal favourites, standing 6'3'' MacKenzie Entwistle has ideal NHL size, tremendous speed for his size, excellent hockey IQ, and best of all top notch character. Entwistle is a player who will be trending upwards at a steep angle, playing behind Stephen Harper \u0026 Niki Petti/Brandon Saigeon in his rookie season \u0026 Petti \u0026 Will Bitten/Brandon Saigeon in his sophmore season, it will be the 17-18 where Entwistle will see his biggest opportunity. A staple on the PK since arriving in Hamilton, Entwistle will be moving up the depth chart with the ability to play C or W and will likely be moving into a regular role on the Bulldogs PP. Get ready for a breakout player!\" - Reed Duthie\n\n\"He will never be an offensive force but he will be on the ice for the final minute of every period, smarter than some coaches in the OHL, phenomenal on the PK, sneaky offense that may come but that will be a bonus.\" - Mark Seidel\n\n**Markus Phillips - Defense - Owen Sound Attack (2 Votes)**  \nHighest Ranking: 7th (1x)  \nComments:  \n\"Has the potential to be an all situations, all around type of defender because of his plus skating. Offensive skills aren't the best of any defender in the draft, but he's crafty.\" - Anonymous\n\n\"Phillips is perhaps the most underrated OHL player in this draft. He had a slow start to the season but vastly improved as the season went on. He reduced his turnovers and became a steady force on Owen Sound's blueline. He projects well to the next level and is expected to make noise on Team Canada in the next couple of seasons.\" - Mark Scheig  \n**Adam Ruzicka - Forward - Sarnia Sting (2 Votes)**  \nHighest Ranking: 8th (1x)  \nComments:  \n\"A slow start as a CHL rookie import knocked this towering Slovak center out of draft radar detection, but he responded with an excellent second half statistically.  Ruzicka, who finished with 24 points in his last 28 games, tied for the most 5v5 points by an OHL rookie (34 in 61 games), and his 171 shots ranked second among Ontario League newcomers. He’s got a very good shot and continues to find ways to get open despite being one of the bigger players on the ice. Ruzicka can play in all three zones, and is both physically and mentally capable of taking over games.\" - Steve Kournianos\n\n\"Sarnia’s best puck handler he can make good moves around the ice. He can even play a North-South style of game because he can play the top and bottom halves of the neutral zone good enough to create an open ice play near the zone entry for a teammate. His specialty with his puck handling comes from his passing, as he likes to make quick light passes with his stick on offensive rushes to fool his opponents into thinking he is dumping the puck. Another complimentary passing skill is his saucer passes, he can make long range saucer passes to teammates that turn into break away chances or he can make a fast and smooth cross ice sauce pass to a teammate going directly to the net. When he is unable to convert on a play he is good at recovering the puck using a quick C-cut to draw the opponent to the opposite side and using his quick hands to form a backhand forehand motion to keep the defenders guessing. Ruzicka possesses such raw natural talent, it’s going to be exciting to see what he can do in the pros once he is of age.\" - Scott Crawford\n\n**Eemeli Rasanen - Defense - Kingston Frontenacs (1 Vote)**  \nHighest Ranking: 10th (1x)  \nComments:  \n\"Unheralded defender out of Kingston that caught and surpassed the highly touted Paquette, great frame mixed with a healthy dose of nasty, feet are ok, big shot on the PP, Very underrated.\" - Mark Seidel\n\n\"Had to include a bit on the best player no one is talking about. 6'7'' 205lbs, the Finnish rookie was an impact player in every sense of the word for Kingston. The defensive specialist added 39pts in 66gp, thanks to a high level first pass from the defensive zone and a bomb of a shot that would scare some professional goaltenders. Add all that into the fact the 18 year old also knows how use to his massive frame to make life miserable for the opposition's best players and he is a player that NHL scouts should be drooling over! SUPER SLEEPER!\" - Reed Duthie  \n**Austen Keating - Forward - Ottawa 67's**  \nHighest Ranking: 9th (1x)  \nComments:  \n\"If there’s one player who hasn’t received the buzz he deserves in the overexposed OHL, it’s Keating. He was a low-scoring Ottawa 67’s team’s best centre from start to finish and while he doesn’t possess elite ability in any one area of his game, he does everything at such an efficient, high level that he nonetheless dictates and controls play and tempo. He’s probably the fourth-best passer out of the OHL in this class behind Suzuki, Vilardi and Thomas and yet he hasn’t been given much attention as a legit prospect.\" - Scott Wheeler\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.758382916Z","tags":null},"/reference/Five-things-to-watch-for-as-LA-Kings-embark-on-new-NHL-season-Los-Angeles-Times":{"title":"","content":"\n# Five things to watch for as L.A.

The next step for them is to win a playoff round or two, and they’re capable of that if a few things go right. They open the season Tuesday against Vegas at Crypto.com Arena.\n\n_Here are five things to watch this season:_\n\n2\n\n### How many points will Kevin Fiala score?\n\n ![Kings forward Kevin Fiala readies for a faceoff during a preseason game against the Ducks on Oct. 2.](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ed2095f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5072x3900+0+0/resize/1200x923!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F27%2F31%2Fcd20f70a41f6bac0de53e58f3707%2F1429838144.jpg)\n\n(Juan Ocampo / NHLI via Getty Images)\n\n[General manager Rob Blake](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2021-05-19/nhl-kings-rob-blake-major-improvement-needed) sent a message when he acquired left wing [Kevin Fiala](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-06-29/kings-acquire-left-wing-kevin-fiala-from-minnesota-wild) and signed him to a seven-year, $55.125-million contract. That told players their progress last season had earned them an upgrade in talent, and that Blake isn’t afraid to spend money for the right fit at the right time.\n\nFiala, center [Anze Kopitar](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-10-03/kings-stanley-cup-contenders-anze-kopitar-phillip-danault-drew-doughty), and right wing [Adrian Kempe](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-07-10/kings-adrian-kempe-agree-4-year-22-million-dollar-extension) could be the balanced, high-scoring first line the Kings have lacked for a long time. Fiala, 26, is coming off career-best totals in goals (33) and points (85), and his skills should mesh well with pass-first Kopitar.\n\nFiala also will get a lot of power-play time, which could pad his totals. If he stays in the range of 80 to 85 points and Kempe can prove his career-best 35 goals and 54 points last season weren’t a fluke, that trio could be dangerous.\n\n3\n\n### Can a healthy Drew Doughty regain his Cup-era form?\n\n ![Kings defenseman Drew Doughty follows the puck during a game against the Ducks on Feb. 25.](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/14faf48/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5297x2980+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F72%2F8a%2F40f8d2d74d3eaa9c285613fbf48a%2Fkings-ducks-hockey-18468.jpg)\n\n(Jae C. Hong / Associated Press)\n\nA deep, mobile defense is a must to succeed in the playoffs. [Drew Doughty](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-02-16/kings-ceremony-for-drew-doughty-loss-to-oilers), who recovered from wrist surgery that ended his season early, seems invigorated by the progress the Kings made last season. At 32, he should have a few elite-level seasons left.\n\nDoughty and Mikey Anderson are a solid pair. Sean Walker’s return from knee surgery also will provide a lift. This could be a big season for Sean Durzi, who showed intriguing flashes of creativity last season.\n\n4\n\n### Which kids will step up?\n\n ![Kings center Quinton Byfield, left, battles for the puck against San Jose Sharks defenseman Markus Nutivaara.](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a24f123/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6452x4301+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1d%2Fd1%2F22e1fedf4c18a9f2ced99e2c0a28%2Fkings-sharks-hockey-09899.jpg)\n\nKings center Quinton Byfield, left, battles for the puck against San Jose Sharks defenseman Markus Nutivaara during a preseason game Sept. 25.\n\n(Tony Avelar / Associated Press)\n\nAll eyes will be on Quinton Byfield, who was expected to play a key role last season but broke his ankle before the season and later was placed on the COVID-19 protocol list while preparing to return.\n\nThe No. 2 overall pick in 2020 produced five goals and 10 points in 40 games, despite his obvious skills and size (6-foot-5, 220 pounds), and he was scratched after the first two games of the Kings’ playoff series against Edmonton. He must turn his occasional brilliance into consistent and responsible play as the third-line center behind Kopitar and [Phillip Danault](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2021-08-11/kings-phillip-danault-new-home).\n\nGabe Vilardi, whose progress has been slowed by injuries since he was drafted No. 11 in 2017, was impressive during training camp. He filled in well while Viktor Arvidsson (20 goals in 66 games last season) recovered from back surgery. Arvidsson’s quicker-than-expected return puts Vilardi on the third line with Byfield and Alex Iafallo, a golden chance for all three to prove themselves.\n\nWinger Arthur Kaliyev, 21, scored six of his 14 goals on the power play and can add punch to the second unit. Defenseman Tobias Bjornfot, 21, has struggled to keep a spot and that’s unlikely to change.\n\n5\n\n### Will goaltending be a problem?\n\n ![Kings goaltender Jonathan Quick watches a shot fly past the goal during a playoff game against the Edmonton Oilers in May.](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/86135f6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2790x1859+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F04%2Fe0%2F76a24fe04ea0bca0e316a0cab6d4%2Foilers-kings-hockey-60281.jpg)\n\n(Mark J. Terrill / Associated Press)\n\nCoach Todd McLellan’s choice of Cal Petersen to start the opener last season seemed to signal an end to the Jonathan Quick-led Cup champions’ era and the rise of the next generation. That was the plan, but Petersen dropped the torch and Quick (.910 save percentage, 2.59 goals-against average) regained his old form.\n\nQuick is as competitive as ever, but he’s approaching 37 and the Kings need to find a reliable partner to share the load. Petersen will get every chance at the job but can’t blow it again. If he falters, Blake might have to make a move.\n\n6\n\n### Can they improve their power play?\n\n ![Kings center Gabriel Vilardi celebrates with teammates after scoring during a preseason game against the Ducks on Oct. 4.](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/148dbde/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5213x3475+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fea%2F19%2F906250994f5399fdf9ccb291f03d%2Fkings-ducks-hockey-86351.jpg)\n\n(Ashley Landis / Associated Press)\n\nEven a small improvement could generate a big boost after the Kings ranked 27th last season with a 16.1% success rate. A failing power play not only wastes chances but drags down the rest of the offense.\n\nNewly hired assistant coach Jim Hiller, who played about half a season with the Kings during his brief NHL career, is in charge of the power play, which could include using Fiala at the point on the first unit.\n\nThe penalty-killing unit (76.7% efficiency, 22nd in the NHL) also needs major improvement.\n\nGet the latest on L.A.'s teams in the daily Sports Report newsletter.\n\nYou may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times.\n\n[![](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7a5578f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1125x1125+438+0/resize/100x100!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fba%2F21%2F8771bf6c69fecba403ad486e1659%2Fimg-5d1bb3e6-turbine-la-xard34z494df-20190702)](https://www.latimes.com/people/helene-elliott)\n\nHelene Elliott joined the Los Angeles Times’ sports department in 1989.

Like so many French-speaking kids in Montreal and the province of Quebec, he pretended to be his heroes when he played against his brother, Pierre.\n\n“When we were like 4 or 5 years old, he’d be the red Canadiens. I was the white ones,” Robitaille, a [Hockey Hall of Fame left wing](https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-robitaille-halloffame-pictures-photogallery.html) and now [president of the Kings](https://www.latimes.com/sports/kings/la-sp-kings-elliott-20190123-story.html), said of Montreal’s classic home and road uniforms.\n\nThe Canadiens won the Stanley Cup in 1966, the year Robitaille was born, and won regularly throughout his childhood and into his adolescence. Montreal Mayor Jean Drapeau would say each spring the team’s Cup parade would “follow the usual route,” and everyone knew what he meant. The Canadiens monopolized the Cup from the 1975-76 season through 1978-79, assembling some of the most powerful and complete teams that ever graced a hockey rink.\n\n“Obviously, we took it for granted. It was just like every year,” Robitaille said. “By the time I started realizing it and I was playing hockey and so forth, they won four Stanley Cups in a row. Crazy when you think about it.”\n\nCrazier still to think that the Canadiens, whose existence and first Cup title predate the formation of the NHL, haven’t won the Cup or reached the Final since 1993. Craziest of all to think this season’s team, which fired its coach in February and was the last to clinch a playoff berth, has ended Montreal’s Cup Final famine.\n\nThe Canadiens, who erased a 3-1 deficit to upset Toronto in seven games, swept Winnipeg and stifled Vegas’ offense in the semifinals, will face the [defending champion Tampa Bay Lightning](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2021-06-25/nhl-playoffs-lightning-beat-islanders-1-0-in-game-7-advance-to-stanley-cup-final) for the Cup starting on Monday in Tampa. In a season made grim by COVID-19 concerns— Montreal coach Dominique Ducharme tested positive for the virus and will miss the first two games in Tampa because he’s still in quarantine— in a league that realigned to group all seven Canada-based teams in one division because of COVID-related travel restrictions, the Canadiens reaching the Final is so absurd that it’s wonderfully right. “It’s exciting. It’s surreal,” Canadiens general manager Marc Bergevin, a native of Montreal, said Sunday.\n\nFor fans in Montreal, it’s bliss.\n\n“For the older folks it’s probably very meaningful and for the younger people, it’s just something that they’ve heard for years and years and years in the past and seen the history,” Robitaille said. “To be there, it must be an amazing feeling.”\n\nAlthough the sports universe has expanded, the Canadiens remain king in their corner of the world. “I don’t think people realize what the Montreal Canadiens mean to the people of Montreal until you go there and live there. It’s part of their life every day, all year round. Even in the summer. When there’s absolutely nothing going on, that’s still part of their life,” Robitaille said.\n\n“It’s unlike anything in the U.S., because you might be the biggest baseball fan and when that’s over you’re probably going to watch football, you know? And you’re going to watch the NBA, you’re going to watch the NHL. But over there, once the Canadiens are over they just stop watching sports and they just wait. A lot of times I joke with my brother, and he lives there, that there are other teams in the NHL. It’s incredible, the passion.”\n\n ![Luc Robitaille raises his arms after scoring a goal and the audience behind him does the same](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c219949/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3041x2018+0+0/resize/1200x796!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F03%2Fe9%2Fa85a074d46329cfaf1209c48b65d%2Fl4-hockey-pro-games-152132.sff)\n\nKings left wing Luc Robitaille celebrates after scoring a goal against the Toronto Maple Leafs in second period action of Game 2 of the NHL Conference finals on May 27, 1993, in Inglewood.\n\n(Reed Saxon / Associated Press)\n\nRobitaille sees some parallels between these Canadiens and the 1993 team that also was a surprise finalist and defeated the Kings in five games with the help of a power play gained via Marty McSorley’s illegally curved stick in Game 2 (sorry if it’s too soon to bring that up again, Kings fans, but you’ve since had two Cup titles to console you). The 1993 Canadiens won 10 of 11 playoff overtime games that year, which Robitaille believes involved a dose of luck; the current team benefitted from injuries and a suspension to key players in each round.\n\nBut the Canadiens will need more than luck to beat the Lightning, who finished third in the Central division while high-scoring winger Nikita Kucherov recovered from hip surgery. Placing him on long-term injured reserve — where they’d stashed the contracts of Marian Gaborik and Anders Nilsson — gave Tampa Bay more than $17 million in salary cap relief to make depth moves before the trade deadline. Kucherov healed in time to return in the playoffs, when the salary cap isn’t in effect. The slumbering Lightning woke up, taking out Florida in six games, Carolina in five, and the New York Islanders in seven games. Kucherov is the playoff scoring leader with 27 points in 18 games.\n\n“Sometimes the stars align for you,” Lightning general manager Julien BriseBois said before the semifinals began.\n\nThe stars seem to have favored the Canadiens so far. Robitaille believes that can continue. “Look at what they’ve done so far,” he said. “I was laughing this week, looking at how everybody had those guys counted out in every series. Literally, no one picked them in any series.\n\n“They certainly are playing very well. They found a way to just come together at the right time. To watch them, there’s no room on the ice. They’re playing like they believe in what they’re doing. They’re not giving up anything up the middle. The goalie is making all the big saves.”\n\nSeems like old times — maybe even time to dig out those parade plans.\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.758382916Z","tags":null},"/reference/HF-Missing-Posts-from-QB":{"title":"","content":"\n# # Prospect Info: Quinton Byfield (2nd Overall 2020 Draft) Discussion part II\n\nDiscussion in '[Los Angeles Kings](https://hfboards.mandatory.com/forums/los-angeles-kings.42/)' started by [kingsboy11](https://hfboards.mandatory.com/members/kingsboy11.143319/), [Apr 16, 2021](https://hfboards.mandatory.com/threads/quinton-byfield-2nd-overall-2020-draft-discussion-part-ii.2817801/).\n\n\n\nMetadata: \n\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html)\n\n---\n-   [![AbsentMojo](https://cdn1-hfboards.mandatory.com/data/avatars/l/301/301853.jpg?1547529860)](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlmembers/absentmojo.301853/)\n    \n    ### \n    \n    [AbsentMojo](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlmembers/absentmojo.301853/)\n    \n    _Enduring the post DL atomic winter_\n    \n    Joined:\n    \n    Apr 17, 2018\n    \n    Messages:\n    \n    [913](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlsearch/member?user_id=301853)\n    \n    Likes Received:\n    \n    703\n    \n    Trophy Points:\n    \n    [64](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.htmlmembers/absentmojo.301853/trophies)\n    \n    SB Cash:\n    \n    $ 100,000\n    \n    Home Page:\n    \n    [https://bit.ly/2SQfxCK](https://bit.ly/2SQfxCK)\n    \n    \u003e I dont see much for QB to learn in the A. If his stride was bad then working on that in the A is ideal like they did for Toffoli. Or, if he had to learn a new position like Vilardi - then send him down. One thing that hasnt been mentioned is the value of practicing with NHL talent and systems... that is only going to help his development to be defended by DD in practice and learning the breakout and eventually the PP with the big club.

When he decides to cut back to shake off a defender, he straightens his legs, then quickly sinks his pelvis to dig into the ice and change direction.

It's not putting him in  \n    \u003e a position to succeed.  \n    \u003e   \n    \u003e I'd honestly love to see him play LW 1 or LW 2 the rest of the year. I think by next year, he will have that much more experience and another Summer of training...probably  \n    \u003e have another 7-8 pounds of muscle and ready to take 3C and succeed. By having the best talent to play with and be on LW, he can play his game and get some PP time as  \n    \u003e well. I do not think he would fail. I think because the Kings are fighting for a playoff spot, Todd won't let this happen, unfortunately....will say crap like \"Quinton needs  \n    \u003e to give himself permission to play well and succeed' or some such trash. Give Kopi 9 minutes with Brown and whomever and zero PP time and watch him fail.  \n    \u003e   \n    \u003e At least AI is on line 3 and hopefully that helps. I think with Todd, you need to earn trust of everyone, to play top 6....Arty has really propelled himself and done that.  \n    \u003e But, he may be on a short leash. We'll see. I don't think ALL players that should get top 6 minutes, may never get that approval mark...or hit that threshold Todd  \n    \u003e wants / demands. It is a good thing to excel and earn it, like Moore has...but talented offensive players need to play in the top 6. I think Lias has the talent to,  \n    \u003e but may not get that chance, here. I know he's had some bleh games, but know he has the talent. If he plays bottom 6 and does not get any PP time, will be a shame.  \n    \u003e He's top 3 in the entire organization, 5 feet from the net. Won't get many chances there in the bottom 6. He and Grundstrom are the first to get scratched, no matter  \n    \u003e how hard they play, or the results.  \n    \u003e   \n    \u003e QB will be fine. He's skating well, getting off some good shots, making good plays...like the spin and sharp pass to Grundstrom, for that goal. Thank God  \n    \u003e Carl goes to the net like that, or that play never happens....as Brown does not go to the net like that, anymore.

The first of those moves was trading a 2021 second-round pick and a 2022 third-round pick to the Nashville Predators [in exchange for Viktor Arvidsson.](https://www.nhl.com/news/viktor-arvidsson-nashville-los-angeles-trade/c-325543696) The initial plan was for Arvidsson to come in and be the goal-scoring winger [Anze Kopitar](https://thehockeywriters.com/docs/anze-kopitar/) has been missing for the last few seasons. Unfortunately, that didn’t happen, but Arvidsson has still found success with the team and is now one of their best offensive weapons.\n\n## Arvidsson on the First Line\n\nAt the beginning of this season, Arvidsson played with Kopitar on the first line, with Dustin Brown and Adrian Kempe rotating out as his wing partners. The initial line of Arvidsson-Kopitar-Brown was okay — it posted solid possession numbers and marginally outscored opponents. Conceptually, the line made sense; Brown would provide physicality and puck retrieval, Arvidsson could provide speed and finishing, while Kopitar was the dominant, two-way playmaker he’s always been. Unfortunately, Arvidsson struggled to finish, couldn’t find chemistry with Kopitar, and Brown was clearly not a first-line player anymore. The line wasn’t a liability by any means, but they were not good enough for a first line. if(typeof \\_\\_ez\\_fad\\_position!='undefined'){\\_\\_ez\\_fad\\_position('div-gpt-ad-thehockeywriters\\_com-medrectangle-3-0')};\n\n![Viktor Arvidsson Los Angeles Kings](https://thehockeywriters.com/ezoimgfmt/s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Viktor-Arvidsson-Kings-2.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng%3Awebp%2Fngcb57)\n\nViktor Arvidsson, Los Angeles Kings ([Jess Starr](https://www.instagram.com/jmstarr_/)/The Hockey Writers)\n\nThe team didn’t give up on Arvidsson on the top line right away, though. They swapped Brown out for Kempe, hoping the two Swedes could find chemistry and jump-start the line. It was successful in that it improved the line’s possession numbers, but the line struggled to score, and couldn’t keep pucks out of their own net. The line would only score once and would concede five before coach Todd McLellan decided to shake things up.\n\n**Related: [Kings Begin Summer Shopping With Arvidsson Trade](https://thehockeywriters.com/kings-arvidsson-trade-positives/)**\n\nHindsight being 20/20, Kempe and Arvidsson were always a poor fit as wing partners. Both players look to generate offense in a similar fashion, using their speed to back defenders off while producing a very high shot volume. The line’s combination of size, speed, and skill allowed them to dominate possession numbers and even produce better chances than their opponents, but they were ultimately one-dimensional and couldn’t consistently produce real offense. if(typeof \\_\\_ez\\_fad\\_position!='undefined'){\\_\\_ez\\_fad\\_position('div-gpt-ad-thehockeywriters\\_com-box-4-0')};\n\n## if(typeof \\_\\_ez\\_fad\\_position!='undefined'){\\_\\_ez\\_fad\\_position('div-gpt-ad-thehockeywriters\\_com-medrectangle-4-0')};Arvidsson on the Second Line\n\nA great safety net for players who are struggling on the Kings this season has been putting them with Phillip Danault, as the second-line center has seemingly improved every winger who has been placed with him. [Arvidsson has been no different](https://mayorsmanor.com/2021/11/projected-lineup-la-kings-vs-ottawa-senators-in-game-20/), finding success with both Alex Iafallo and Trevor Moore playing opposite of him. The Moore-Danault-Arvidsson line has been particularly impressive, with one of the best goal percentages in the NHL, outscoring opponents 12-2. They’ve also been dominant in possession, controlling over 60 percent of both shot attempts and shots on net. The newly crowned “Nice Line” was pivotal in a great month of January where the team went 8-4-2, and Arvidsson is a key member of their success.\n\n![Viktor Arvidsson Los Angeles Kings](https://thehockeywriters.com/ezoimgfmt/s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Viktor-Arvidsson-Kings-1200x800.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb57)\n\nViktor Arvidsson, Los Angeles Kings ([Jess Starr](https://www.instagram.com/jmstarr_/)/The Hockey Writers)\n\nA very hard worker, much like Danault and Moore, Arvidsson injects a dose of skill and speed into the line. A good presence on the forecheck, a high-volume shooter, and one of the league’s best at creating off the rush, he complements his two linemates perfectly. Danault is a play driver who dominates in the corners and along the wall, while [Moore is a Swiss Army knife](https://hockeyroyalty.com/2022/01/20/la-kings-the-emergence-of-trevor-moore-and-why-its-good-for-hockey-in-california/) who can perform any role asked of him.\n\nIt’s on the rush where Arvidsson does the most damage — according to AllThreeZones.com, only Johnny Gaudreau has generated more offense off the rush than Arvidsson this season. According to the same website, he’s also generating the most shots per 60 minutes, with a staggering 22.81 shots per 60. His finishing let him down massively at the beginning of the season, scoring just twice in his first 10 games, and just six times in his first 25 games. He’s starting to find his scoring touch, though, with seven goals in his last 14 games; we’re beginning to see shades of the two-time 30-goal scorer he once was.\n\nWhile it’s very unlikely he’s able to break the 30-goal mark again this season, especially considering he’s missed seven games already, I do expect him to continue this upward trajectory. His play earlier in the season deserved more goals and he’s now being rewarded for solid play. It will be interesting to see how long the Moore-Danault-Arvidsson line can keep up this level of dominance, but I think regardless of what happens with that line we can expect this version of Arvidsson to stay, if not improve.if(typeof \\_\\_ez\\_fad\\_position!='undefined'){\\_\\_ez\\_fad\\_position('div-gpt-ad-thehockeywriters\\_com-banner-1-0')};\n\n## A Smart Acquisition\n\nThe [NHL expansion draft last](https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/31858223/seattle-kraken-expansion-draft-live-results-players-selected-30-nhl-teams) summer created a unique opportunity for Blake to go out and grab a player for much cheaper than they should have been, and he capitalized. Under normal circumstances, a player with Arvidsson’s pedigree and underlying numbers, which showed a bounce-back was inevitable, would never have been traded for so little. He’s already surpassed his point total from last season and is only getting better as the season progresses. This was always a perfect low-risk, high-reward move for the Kings, and they’re very close to cashing in on the high-reward portion of the deal.\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.762383035Z","tags":null},"/reference/Kings-Select-Kasper-Simontaival-Round-3-Pick-66-LA-Kings-Insider":{"title":"","content":"\n# Kings Select Kasper Simontaival (Round 3, Pick 66) - LA Kings Insider\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e The LA Kings have selected forward Kasper Simontaival with the 66th overall pick in the 2020 NHL Draft!

But he remains a very quality player with a lot of intriguing offensive attributes. He’s got a very quick stick and can beat defenders with his skill. I wouldn’t call him a top playmaker, but he can find the seams on the ice well and flash high-end vision. His shot is more impressive to me than his passing, although I think both are certainly strong points. The main areas of concern for Simontaival are his small frame and just fine skating. I think his edgework is good and he’s shifty in small spaces, but he lacks any real speed and his stride breaks down more than you’d like for a small forward. He does compete well and is good around the net, but he isn’t that strong in puck battles or defensively.\n\n**[Via ESPN’s Chris Peters](https://www.espn.com/nhl/insider/story/_/id/29994322/2020-nhl-draft-rankings-final-top-100-prospects-class-chris-peters-plus-position-rankings)**  \nHe’s small but quick with excellent hands and a desire to create. Simontaival put up big numbers in Finland’s top junior league this season but couldn’t quite find his game against pros. There’s a lot of room for him to improve certain elements of his game, but I think his speed helps lessen any size worries.\n\n**[Elite Prospects 2020 Draft Guide](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/397010/kasper-simontaival)**  \nHe’s a true dual-threat winger with two-way upside, a sturdy frame, and the type of competitiveness necessary to hang in there as a vertically-challenged forward. The 5-foot-9 winger has a lethal release that can beat goalies from tough angles and long distances. He wields the best shot out of Finland in this year’s draft.\n\n![](https://lakingsinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MicrosoftTeams-image-640x427.jpg \"MicrosoftTeams-image\")\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.758382916Z","tags":null},"/reference/Kings-open-season-with-heartbreaking-loss-to-Golden-Knights-Los-Angeles-Times":{"title":"","content":"\n# Kings open season with heartbreaking loss to Golden Knights - Los Angeles Times\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e For the first time in years, the Kings are out of their rebuild stage as they look to chisel a clear path to becoming Stanley Cup contenders.\n\nHelene Elliott\n\n---\nWhen [Todd McLellan](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2020-12-11/todd-mclellan-expecting-the-unexpected-in-his-second-season-with-kings) was hired to coach the downtrodden [Kings](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey) in 2019, he compared them to marathon runners at Mile 1. With a hard-fought playoff series loss behind him and the deepest, most skillful lineup he has had at his disposal, McLellan updated that analogy as he began his fourth season.\n\n“We’ve settled into the race now,” he said. “We’ve climbed some hills. We got in some valleys. I think in marathons there’s runners that break away and sometimes the pack catches them again. I would say we’re in that pack. We’re no longer in Miles 1 through 5. We’re way further into it.\n\n“But if crossing the finish line and putting a medal around your neck is the Stanley Cup championship, we still have a lot of running to do.”\n\nTrue. But they’re striding purposefully now, not stumbling. They have structure, defined lines and a mobile defense corps that’s injury-free.\n\n“We wasted an outstanding goaltending effort by not getting a point tonight,” McLellan said of goaltender Jonathan Quick’s effort against a 51-shot barrage.\n\nStill, looking at the big picture, they’re no longer running on a treadmill to failure. Their path is clear. They just have to avoid hitting the wall.\n\n“We made a step last year but now we have to make sure we’re taking the ability to move past that and keep that going,” general manager Rob Blake said Monday in discussing the season. “I think there’s less and less concerns through our lineup. I think there still are at different times and there will be at times as the season goes on, but I do think we have players that can fill some certain roles and we do have some depth in the right positions if needed.”\n\nThe impact of acquiring and signing [left wing Kevin Fiala](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-06-29/kings-acquire-left-wing-kevin-fiala-from-minnesota-wild) to a seven-year, $55.125-million contract extends beyond hoping he will replicate the career-best 33 goals and 85 points he scored for Minnesota last season and join [Kempe](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-07-10/kings-adrian-kempe-agree-4-year-22-million-dollar-extension) and [center Anze Kopitar](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2021-05-06/column-1-000-point-milestone-reaffirms-kopitar-as-one-of-l-a-s-most-accomplished-athletes) to form an elite first line.\n\n“I think Rob has made some really good moves and it just shows us that he believes in us and he spent that money for a really good player that we needed,” said [center Phillip Danault](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2021-08-11/kings-phillip-danault-new-home), who added an offensive dimension to his trademark solid defense during his first season with the Kings. “Rob did a big move, and now it’s our time to show it on the ice.”\n\n ![Vegas' Jack Eichel, right, shoots under pressure from Kings' Phillip Danault, foreground, and Viktor Arvidsson.](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/abea0c6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4959x3306+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F14%2F38%2F8f7fc87b4aebbffd953b028376ad%2Fgolden-knights-kings-hockey-15940.jpg)\n\nVegas Golden Knights’ Jack Eichel, right, shoots under pressure from Kings’ Phillip Danault, foreground, and Viktor Arvidsson during the first period on Tuesday at Crpyto.com Arena.\n\n(Jae C. Hong / Associated Press)\n\nWhether Danault can match the 27 goals and 51 points he scored last season alongside Thousand Oaks native Trevor Moore and Viktor Arvidsson is one of the “ifs” that will go a long way toward determining the Kings’ fate. The same is true for Kempe’s career-high 35 goals and 54 points.\n\nIf those were flukes, scoring will continue to be a problem. If Danault and Kempe can match or surpass those totals, there will be less pressure on their kids to produce, though 2020 No.2 pick Quinton Byfield and 2017 No.11 pick Vilardi — on the third line with Alex Iafallo — must contribute.\n\n“Yes, I can do it again,” Danault said. “I can’t wait to see what this year is going to bring, and obviously I’m waiting for what I’ve wanted to achieve my whole life — winning the Cup.”\n\nDanault’s offensive output last season was a bonus. “We definitely have an expectation of Phil that now increases offensively, but I think a lot of it surrounds around his leadership. I felt that he added a big touch to that,” Blake said. “That created excitement some of those players bought in. And now we have to get that out of Kevin Fiala, we have to get it out of some of our young guys who are going to take a little bit more prominent roles on the team.”\n\nMcLellan said he’d seen no signs of Kempe faltering. “Is he a 35-goal scorer? I sure hope so,” McLellan said. “But I know he’s a 20-minute player for sure most nights, and that’s just as important as being a 35-goal scorer.”\n\nUm, sure. But another big season from Kempe is essential, even if new assistant coach Jim Hiller pulls off a miracle and fixes their feeble power play. “When you get into tight situations or an overtime situation and you’re relying on a big player to step up, he’s now at that level for us,” Blake said of Kempe.\n\nThe only change on defense to start the season, other than Drew Doughty and Sean Walker returning from injuries, was the presence on the roster of 19-year-old Brandt Clarke, the eighth pick in the 2021 draft. Clarke didn’t play Tuesday but he might not wait long because McLellan wants to limit the burden on defenseman Sean Durzi, who is coming off shoulder surgery.\n\nGoaltending is their biggest “maybe.” Quick started Tuesday and Cal Petersen backed him up; Petersen started the opener last season but struggled and lost the job. Petersen was shaky in training camp and if he doesn’t find his footing soon, Blake might have to look elsewhere to support Quick, 36.\n\nIn the meantime, the Kings’ marathon continues. They won’t win the race this season, but the finish line isn’t so impossibly far away anymore.\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.758382916Z","tags":null},"/reference/Kings-prep-for-Rooke-Faceoff-with-Quinton-Byfield-but-without-Alex-Turcotte":{"title":"","content":"\n# Kings prep for Rookie Faceoff with Quinton Byfield, but without Alex Turcotte – Daily News\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e The Kings believe Byfield, 20, still has “a lot of room left to play harder,” but Turcotte, 21, has yet to be cleared to practice and will not travel for the six-team event in San Jose this weekend…\n\nAndrew Knoll\n\nMetadata: \n\n2022-09-15\n[[Los Angeles Daily News]]\n[Original Link](https://www.dailynews.com/2022/09/15/kings-prep-for-rookie-faceoff-with-quinton-byfield-but-without-alex-turcotte/)\n\n---\n-   ![Jordan Spence was among the Kings players practicing at Toyota...](https://www.dailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/LDN-L-KINGS-0916-9.jpg?w=620)\n    \n    Jordan Spence was among the Kings players practicing at Toyota Sports Performance Center in El Segundo on Thursday ahead of the six-team Rookie Faceoff tournament this weekend in San Jose.

(Photo by Chuck Bennett, Contributing Photographer)\n\n\nEL SEGUNDO –– As the Kings prepared for a three-game sojourn in San Jose for the [2022 Rookie Faceoff tournament](https://www.sjbarracuda.com/tickets/rookie-face-off-2022), there was at least one somewhat surprising presence and one discouraging absence on the practice ice.\n\nCenter Quinton Byfield was in the mix once again, despite the 2020 second overall draft pick’s participation in nearly half the Kings’ games last season. He was the most NHL-experienced player on the ice, and the most prominent along with Brandt Clarke, whom the Kings selected eighth overall last year.\n\n“I think there’s a lot of room left to play harder, because of (Byfield’s) size and strength, he just doesn’t know it yet,” said Ontario Reign coach Marco Sturm, who ran the practice and coached Byfield with the Kings last season. “He will figure it out. It takes time and experience, but this year he should do it more than he did in the past, and I think he will.”\n\nSturm added that Byfield, 20, “looked like a man” among his less experienced and mostly more fresh-faced peers.\n\nThe remaining top-10 pick in the Kings’ prospect pool, 21-year-old center Alex Turcotte (No. 5 overall in 2019) was nowhere to be found, despite having been listed on the initial list of camp participants. Turcotte sustained two concussions last season, curbing his development and overshadowing his eight-game stint with the big club.\n\nSturm offered little in the way of a detailed update on Turcotte, saying only that his spirits were high but that the doctors were still evaluating his condition before giving an all-clear. Turcotte will not travel to San Jose for games against Colorado on Friday, Vegas on Saturday and San Jose on Monday.\n\n“As of right now, he’s not cleared, that’s all that I know,” Sturm said. “We want him healthy. He’s been through a lot in the past so we want to take our time and when the doctor says he’s ready to go, then he is.”\n\nThough two concussions, one during the regular season and one during the postseason, might be daunting to surmount, Turcotte isn’t the only Kings prospect to overcome injuries during his development period.\n\nForwards Rasmus Kupari and Gabe Vilardi, a pair of former first-rounders, were on the ice working with other veterans and goalie coach Bill Ranford on Thursday. But both had spent substantial time on the sidelines earlier in their careers. Kupari sustained a severe knee injury while competing for the Finnish junior national team and Vilardi went through a lengthy process to recover from back surgery and related complications early in his career.\n\nCenter Akil Thomas, who was on the ice with the rookie tournament group on Thursday, also confronted serious injury, most notably a double shoulder surgery ahead of last season. Thomas admitted that missing training camp and the first two months of the season presented mental and physical challenges. He shook them off, however, to finish with 11 points in his final 14 games last season and four goals in four playoff matches.\n\nThomas, whom Sturm said he expected to assume a leadership role in Ontario if he doesn’t make the Kings’ roster, said that he anticipated a similar path back to action for Turcotte.\n\n“Hopefully it’s just a bump in the road. Everyone deals with injuries and whatnot. Obviously, his is taking a little longer than expected, but I’m sure he’ll be good to go sooner than later,” Thomas said. “He’ll take some time to find himself again, but I’m sure he will.”\n\nSturm said it was too early to tell if Turcotte would be available for the Kings’ training camp later this month.\n\nOne player who was already looking forward to training camp was Clarke, who lauded the caliber of opponents the Kings would face in San Jose and said he was seeking to make a strong impression in September in order to join the team full-time in October.\n\n“My goal is to play on this team this year, be a contributor on this team this year, and in the next couple weeks I’m going to try and do the best I can to show that I can hang with these guys,” Clarke said.\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.758382916Z","tags":null},"/reference/Midseason-MediaScout-Top-10-for-2017":{"title":"Midseason MediaScout Top 10 for 2017","content":"\n# Midseason MediaScout Top 10 for 2017\n\n\n\n# OHL Prospects: Midseason Media/Scout Top 10 for 2017\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e It's time for an update to our media/scout list.

There's still lots of meaningful hockey to be played (rest of the CHL regular season, CHL playoffs, U18's), but it's always great to see how opinions change over the course of a season.\n\nJust so happens that things have changed quite a bit. We've got a switch at the top of the list. The guy who placed 10th (Greg Meireles) last time around didn't even get a vote this time. And a ton of other movement up and down has occurred. The OHL has a few top notch prospects available for this draft (Tippett and Vilardi), and quite a few guys who are emerging as potential first rounders. The depth of the league is looking very strong with the potential to occupy close to 40% of the players drafted in the first two rounds. Because of this, the variance of opinion is quite vast. Not only are the masses split on who the top player is (11 to 6), but twelve different players received votes for the top 5. In addition to that, only four players received votes from all 17 contributors.\n\nAs always, it's important to note the contributors, as without them and their terrific insight, this article does not exist.

Owen Tippett - Forward - Mississauga Steelheads**  \nTotal Votes: 17  \nHigh/Low Ranking: 1st (11x)/2nd (6x)  \nComments:  \n\"I just like his demeanor and mindset as a shooter. He plays the game hard and knows where to be to get himself in good scoring areas. Tippett, to me, has the best shot of this draft class; it's NHL caliber already. He can fire off a wrist, snap or slap shot very quickly and he gets a low of power behind it.\" - Morreale\n\n\"The unquestioned horse of the Steelheads has played a vital role in their current surge. Scouts are fighting wanting more consistency from him, but beware of having too high expectations - over a quarter of his games on the season have been multi-goal efforts. Size, speed, shot peppering forwards are always in high demand. Doesn't hurt that down the line, he has all the right ingredients to be one of the best players in the draft.\" - Mauro\n\n\"Tippett is one of the best shooters in the 2017 NHL Draft, someone who can cleanly beat goalies with his release. This season, he has unquestionably been Mississauga’s best player and a more dangerous offensive threat than captain and New Jersey Devils first rounder Michael McLeod.\" - Wheeler\n\n\"Tippett's games revolves around his lethal shot and scoring goals. His speed creates separation from defenders and allows him to get open, his size allows him to drive the net. He is able to release the puck with little to no warning as he disguises his shot effectively. While his whole game is in support of one aspect (scoring) it is a pretty sought after commodity in the pro level and I see his game transitioning well in higher levels.\" - Harling\n\n\"With goal scoring in the NHL at a premium snipers will always be coveted for the draft, and even if the Mississauga winger can be lax in his own zone at times or fail to find a linemate for a scoring opportunity far too often, he is going to score goals with his excellent release, accuracy and velocity.\" - McCagg\n\n\"Tippett is the most dynamic draft-eligible player I've seen in the OHL this season, and it's not that close. He has the rare combination of speed and lethal shot that will make him an offensive force at the next level. His defensive game is a work in progress, but there are signs of improvement. The reason he is first over Vilardi for me is higher upside at the next level. You can't teach what Tippett brings to the table.\" - Scheig  \n**2\\. Gabriel Vilardi - Forward - Windsor Spitfires**  \nTotal Votes: 17  \nHigh/Low Ranking: 1st (6x)/2nd (11x)  \nComments:  \n\"Injuries and an appendectomy have cost Vilardi a lot of time this season. Despite that, he still tops the list for me. But you should be intrigued by the big center who can be just as effective playing the wing as he is down the middle. He isn’t the fastest or most elegant skater, but he makes up for any downfall with his hockey smarts, vision and work ethic.Vilardi plays a solid three zone game. He’s at his best when he has the puck on his stick, seemingly always in control. Below the dots, he’s a force and tough to beat. He can create chances for himself or his teammates. Quite simply, he makes everyone on the ice better.\" - Tiano\n\n\"Though there are some minor concerns about his skating, I still have Vilardi up top because he's a big, talented center and that's what the NHL craves. His hockey smarts and great and he can create goals in traffic.\" - Kennedy\n\n“Impactful on the wing or at center as a goal scorer/playmaker duel threat. Makes skilled plays with his head and his hands. Has the size, skills and smarts that make me believe he will have no problems translating his game to the NHL level.\" - Stewart\n\n\"The thing about Vilardi is that he's very close to being NHL ready. The injury issues have been more a case of bad luck IMO, and not necessarily a concerning trend. If he puts in the work this summer, he could be an NHL player next year IMO (much like Matthew Tkachuk). This is because he controls play below the hashmarks so well and has such a good head for the game at both ends of the ice. He plays a very \"pro style\" game. His first few steps and top speed will need to improve, but it will. Reminds me so much of Sean Monahan in his draft year.\" - Otten\n\n\"The Kingston native is a bit of a 'safe' pick in the OHL draft class this season because he is such a well-rounded prospect who can chip in across all three zones. His skating is a glaring weakness but his soft hands, vision and ability to use his size and strength deep in the offensive zone are worthy of the praises that he's receiving. He will have an opportunity to showcase his talents deep into the season with the Spitfires acting as Memorial Cup hosts and it will be interesting to see whether he grabs a hold of the reigns and solidifies his top 10 selection. He's a player that's easy to like because of his smarts but you wonder how much offensive upside he owns and whether he can be considered a true top line forward at the next level.\" - Ross\n\n**3\\. Nic Hague - Defense - Mississauga Steelheads**  \nTotal Votes: 17  \nHigh/Low Ranking: 3rd (8x)/6th (3x)  \nComments:  \n\"I'm sure many will focus on his size and projection as a shut down type of defender. But I'd rather talk about the interesting progression of his offensive game. He's not your prototypical offensive defender. He's not a particularly dynamic player off the rush and I don't think he's got a natural feel as a puck carrier/distributor. But, he uses his size exceptionally well in the offensive end. Consistently pinches in deep to keep pucks in, and actually plays a lot below the hash marks, using his size to work the cycle. He's smart about it though and doesn't get caught up ice all that much. Then there's the big point shot. He does a great job of finding scoring lanes and he actually does a good job of using different releases to get it through to the net. I don't know how much that will translate to the next level, but the improvements and confidence in his ability to make things happen in the offensive end is worth noting.\" - Otten\n\n\"Started out slowly but his game continues to improve...Has the biggest shot from the point in the Draft.\" - Seidel\n\n\"The size and reach are great, but the scouts I talk to wonder about his next-level projection in terms of offence. Seems like he'll be a shutdown guy if he continues to improve his skating.\" - Kennedy\n\n\"He has the enviable size for a defensemen, but the offensive numbers put up in the OHL are curious.  He wasn't a scorer at all in minor midget, but has double digit goals in both his OHL seasons, and you do not often see that from a D man.   Took a vicious knee on knee from Chandler Yakimowicz, and while that won't affect his draft status, hopefully he will be able to showcase his skills in the post season.\" - Clark\n\n\"Hague should be the first defenceman taken from the OHL, he has a tremendous package of size, skating and offensive ability. His performance this season has not been as dominant as I had predicted but big defencemen sometimes develop a little slower. The point is he has developed this year and his ceiling is very high. To acquire defencemen of his abilities in the NHL you have to draft them so look for Hague to go off the board early in the first round.\" - Harling\n\n**4\\. Nick Suzuki - Forward - Owen Sound Attack**  \nTotal Votes: 17  \nHigh/Low Ranking: 3rd (4x)/10th (1x)  \nComments:  \n“Two-way center who has been a major component for the impressive Attack squad this season. His intelligence and drive are impressive but his size and how his game will translate because of it at the NHL level is still a question in my mind.\" - Stewart\n\n\"Suzuki is the 2017 NHL Draft’s everyman, a player who has quickly emerged as one of the most well-rounded prospects in the class. Were it not for a diminutive stature, Suzuki’s success this season would have made him a lock as a top-10 pick in 2017.\" - Wheeler\n\n\"Growing up in London, Suzuki has been a familiar prospect dating back to his Jr. Knights days and much is the same with this well-rounded, intelligent player. He continues to be one of the smartest and hardest working players in his age group but he's been able to take his production up to a level that wasn't entirely expected. Another safe prospect to become an NHL player given his \"complete\" game style, Suzuki can easily be slotted into a middle six role and thrive playing special teams. He processes the game intelligently and has great timing, allowing him to arrive on pucks in optimum locations for scoring chances. Suzuki may never be counted on to carry an NHL offence but, much like Bo Horvat, he'll become a great two-way player who produces more than people expect.\" - Ross\n\n\"One of the most likable players in this draft class because of his hustle and consistency. Dating back to last year, he's been one of the most impressive 99's in the OHL ([I had him ranked as the 3rd most impressive rookie last year](http://ohlprospects.blogspot.ca/2016/03/sunday-top-10-most-impressive-born-1999.html)). Does everything for the Attack and projects as a very well rounded NHL player too. I think the scary thing about Suzuki though is that he's still pretty physically immature. He's one of the youngest players available in the draft, with room to grow in his puck protection ability and skating strength. Perhaps there's even a late growth spurt in there too. With a strong performance in the OHL playoffs and/or the Under 18's, Suzuki is a guy who I could see sneaking into the lottery.\" - Otten\n\n\"Exceptional two-way player who was a key part of the Attack’s 16 game winning streak. Among draft eligible players he’s second in points, first in assists, second in plus/minus, third in faceoff percentage, second longest goal scoring streak of the season, fourth in shot attempts and second in shots on goal. Suzuki is a superb skater with exceptional hockey sense. In my opinion, he’s been the most consistent forward from the start until now.\" - Tiano\n\n**5\\. Robert Thomas - Forward - London Knights**  \nTotal Votes: 15  \nHigh/Low Ranking: 3rd (1x)/Outside of the Top 10 (2x)  \nComments:  \n\"The Aurora native has always landed high in my rankings even dating back to his OHL draft season with the York Simcoe Express. His emergence may have surprised many but it's been more of a \"wait-and-see\" approach for me because when a player of his smarts and skill comes along, you just know it's a matter of time before he's going to be turning heads. Thomas' is a cerebral attacker who's at his best with the puck on his stick allowing him to dictate the speed and direction of attack. He processes the game at a high level and can break down defences with quick timely passes or elusive in-control maneuver to create scoring lanes. His game reminds me of Robby Fabbri where he doesn't rely just on speed or pure dangles but rather a slick combination of the two. His size is less than ideal but he's a smart player who reads and reacts accordingly with confidence to leave his mark on every shift. Truthfully, he's right there with Suzuki and Hague on my list.\" - Ross\n\n\"His terrific smarts and speed helped make him a standout in most games...makes a ton of subtle little plays that may not always go noticed but buy him a bit more time or free up someone else for a nice pass.  He seems incapable of playing a poor game due to his work ethic, terrific sense and skating ability.\" - McCagg\n\n\"The kid does it all for London...Has more offense than some think but is smart all over the ice.\" - Seidel\n\n\"Well, he wasn’t on my list in your first poll early in the season, but he’s come up very quietly. One of the smartest players in the draft class who always seems to find himself in the right place at the right time. Thomas is an exceptional skater with blazing speed with or without the puck. His vision is superb and he is so smart. He could very well be the best playmaker available. He’s become a key player for Coach Hunter who uses him in all situations. He’s become a key pk’er and on the pp, if you don’t keep him close and in your vision, you’re going to get burned.\" - Tiano\n\n**6\\. Matthew Strome - Forward - Hamilton Bulldogs**  \nTotal Votes: 14  \nHigh/Low Ranking: 4th (1x)/Outside of the Top 10 (3x)  \nComments:  \n\"Matthew is more grittier than his two older brothers. He'll move into the corners, make or take a hit and get to the front of the net for loose pucks. He's a prototypical power forward with good finishing ability. The one knock has been his skating but he's been working extremely hard to improve that area of his game.\" - Morreale\n\n\"There's no denying that Strome has next level abilities but I am slightly more hesitant on the Bulldogs forward. He's a very smart player who reads the ice very well but his skating leaves a lot to be desired and while it's an area that can be improved easier than others, it still concerns me heading into the next level. He's a player who excels as a playmaker and can execute highly difficult plays but whenever I watch him, he never has the puck as much as I'd want.\" - Ross\n\n\"The first thing that jumped out to me watching Strome was \"Mark Stone\"- the ability to score, be a power forward, create havoc out front, and he has a nice edge to his game.  Sure the skating needs work, but he knows that and has already committed to off season training.\" - Clark\n\n\"Strome fell a bit in my rankings, but it is more due to the play of others being elevated. However, the stretch in December when Matt Luff and Niki Petti were injured Strome showed he wasn't ready to carry an offense. Still there are bright spots to his game and signs to be optimistic. He is bigger and more willing to use his size than his brothers and has the versatility and the instincts to be a very solid 2 way player.\" - Kneulman\n\n**7\\. Isaac Ratcliffe - Forward - Guelph Storm**  \nTotal Votes: 11  \nHigh/Low Ranking: 3rd (3x)/Outside of the Top 10 (6x)  \nComments:  \n\"Had a very impressive Top Prospects game performance where he stood out for his size, offensive ability and his defensive play. While the NHL is allowing smaller skill players more regularly into the league, there will always be a preference to bigger players if all things are equal. Ratcliffe may not have elite hands for the NHL but he is more than adequate and skating is not a liability either. Already at 6-5 at 18-years-old he should project as an ideal power forward.\" - Harling\n\n\"Towering kid comes from an athletic family and is really progressing well with the Storm. Combination of puck sense, size and physicality is tantalizing.\" - Kennedy\n\n“Tall and gangly with lots of room to add muscle but his on-ice game is progressing at a very good clip this season. Skates better than you would expect a growing 6-6 kid too and has some real offensive potential. Dangerous anywhere around the crease.\" - Stewart\n\n\"The power forward who can skate and possesses very soft hands has been coming on lately. I think he’s underrated offensively in some circles. He’s a physical beast who can play a very mean game. Almost impossible to knock off the puck and uses his size and strength to maintain possession. Right now, he’s probably the best prospect in front of the goal, battling for space and loose pucks and banging in rebounds. We caught a glimpse of that in the Top Prospects game. The scary thought is he’s still going to grow and get stronger.\" - Tiano\n\n**8\\. Michael Dipietro - Goaltender - Windsor Spitfires**  \nTotal Votes: 12  \nHigh/Low Ranking: 4th (2x)/Outside of the Top 10 (5x)  \nComments:  \n\"May be a little high for a goalie but there is no denying that DiPietro may be the best Ontario born goalie at this age in the last 10 years. When he is not setting team records for shutouts in a season or playing the Grinch and preventing children from getting teddy bears for Christmas he is using his size and elite positioning and anticipation skills to keep a Windsor team beset by injuries competitive. Sometimes I feel there is a bias towards Ontario born goalies and really with their minimal success at the next level I cant fault anyone for having that bias. DiPietro however should quell some of those thoughts even if NHL central scouting is slow to realize it.\" - Kneulman\n\n\"Where would Windsor be without DiPietro in net? He has been a workhorse for the Spitfires and has already won 20-plus games. He isn't the biggest goalie of this draft class and, because of that, his athleticism and high-end skills need to be high end and they are. He has an excellent glove hand and is very square to the shooters. He's a player you can't help but root for.\" - Morreale\n\n\"Any goaltender who has a chance of being selected in the first round deserves a lot of attention. DiPietro is the best goaltender I've seen in the league since perhaps Matt Murray. He's not big, but is very athletic and technically sound. He is excellent at anticipating a play and being ready to stop it. The extra time playing for the Memorial Cup hosts will only help him play in pressure situations. He has the upside of a number one in the NHL.\" - Scheig\n\n\"If goaltenders get better with age, it’ s downright scary to think how good Di:ietro will be by the time he reaches his mid-20’s. Poised, quick and cerebral, the Windsor Spitfire leads all OHL netminders in every major statistical category, including a mind-numbing six shutouts in 37 games. Want more? DiPietro has the best high-danger save percentage (.839) of any OHL goalie who has faced over 1000 shots.\" - Kournianos\n\n**9\\. Alex Formenton - Forward - London Knights**  \nTotal Votes: 8  \nHigh/Low Ranking: 6th (2x)/Outside of the Top 10 (9x)  \nComments:  \n\" Considering Formenton was ranked 49th on my final OHL Draft ranking in 2015, it's safe to say that this high ranking should come at no surprise. The Knights grabbed the undersized forward with their 216th selection that season and are looking like geniuses less than two years later. He was a top performer at CHL/NHL Top Prospects Game testing and has had a great season with London drawing more minutes in his second season. He's sprouted up eight inches since his pre-OHL days and is now skating at 6-foot-1. His enthusiastic attack mixes good levels of grit and skill and he's a player who always seems to be around the puck. Deceptively slick hands in flight allow him to dance defenders with quick plays and good use of his wingspan. He's not afraid to stick his nose in and get dirty either, taking hits to make plays and driving the net hard for second chance opportunities. There's a lot to like about Formenton's game and I think the best is yet to come.\" - Ross\n\n\"Amazing set of physical skills, he won the on-ice combine at the Top Prospects Game. Also plays physical and has a nice scoring touch.\" - Kennedy\n\n\"Formenton possesses a lot of speed and is a very good skater. I wouldn’t hesitate in saying he’s one of the top ten fastest skaters in the OHL. He drives the puck wide with more confidence, often burning defenders very much like the way Zach Senyshyn does with the Soo Greyhounds. Like all Hunter teams, you must be able to play in all three zones and Formenton has come a long way. He has the same worth ethic in the defensive zone as he does in the offensive zone.\" - Tiano\n\n\"King City native has wheels and length right now after enduring a growth spurt and being one of the youngest in the draft. Boasts a truly unique and exciting development curve that hasn't even begun to take shape, really. Needs to be settle down offensively on the attack, but that will come. It's not often you find a kid with sky high potential who works his ass off and is this defensively aware.\" - Mauro\n\n**10\\. Ivan Lodnia - Forward - Erie Otters**  \nTotal Votes: 7  \nHigh/Low Ranking: 3rd (1x)/Outside of the Top 10 (10x)  \nComments:  \n\"In terms of overall skill set, I haven't seen anyone all season bring more to the table than Lodnia. He is a threat every time he touches the puck and can beat you in so many ways. Whether he's driving the net and scoring, or dangling around another defender, Lodnia uses his creativity to get open and make plays. Size and skating seem to be a knock on him. He shot up to 5-foot-11 this season, but appears to have lost a step in his skating. His skating is still good and he's not done growing yet. He's also been buried in the Otters lineup at times, which explains why some of his numbers might be \"down\". He has the makings of being a day two bargain at the draft with day one talent.\" - Scheig\n\n\"Lodnia has played less of a roll since Erie’s trade deadline acquisitions of Anthony Cirelli and Warren Foegele, but he’s an offensive threat in his own right and a kid who can create as a shooter and as a passer.\" - Wheeler\n\n\"Another short, but not small player at 5-10. Lodnia has plenty of hockey strength and has shown his offensive ability consistently this season. While his offensive production is not at the top of the league, he brings the same compete level every time I see him. Scouts will like that.\" - Harling\n\n\"Lodnia is a very well rounded offensive player. Even though he's on the smaller side, I love his intensity in the offensive end. Makes a lot of plays within 5 feet of the crease. Also think he has high hockey sense and does well moving without the puck. That said, my concern is that he's an undersized scorer who isn't the world's greatest skater. He's not explosive, nor does he possess high end speed. Worth noting that he's hit a growth spurt and as such may be lacking in strength, but I do wonder if he's a Dante Salituro type of player who armchair scouts like a lot more than actual ones.\" - Otten\n\n**Honorable Mentions**\n\n**Sasha Chmelevski - Forward - Ottawa 67's (7 Votes)**  \nHighest Ranking: 4th (1x)  \nComments:  \n“A constant threat to score but does not always give a consistent effort. His skills are top 20 in the draft class but he has only displayed them in flashes. This ranking is based off what he can do and a hope that he will realize the kind of effort it will take to get to the NHL.\" - Stewart\n\n\"Inconsistency has been a problem this season for Chmelevski, he was great in a pre-season tournament, cooled off after the season started but was very good at the Top Prospects game. Perhaps he is struggling in Ottawa where he is missing elite level talent to play with. Elite players should not need to depend on teammates so that’s a red flag for me, but there is no denying his skill.\" - Harling\n\n\"Crafty American pivot who is a money player when his team needs a big play. Chmelevski was the critical piece Sarnia shipped to Ottawa in last year’s Travis Konecny trade, and he’s rewarded them with a team-best 10 power-play goals and is their best player at the dot (56%). Chmelevski has a deadly shot and takes high percentage shots, but his even strength production (15 ES points in 39 games) is a tad worrisome.\" - Kournianos\n\n\"Has hit some ruts with the 67s, but the high-end skill is obvious. He's very patience and crafty when the puck is on his stick and he can really wire it.\" - Kennedy\n\n**Conor Timmins - Defense - Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds (7 Votes)**  \nHighest Ranking: 4th (1x)  \nComments:  \n\"Timmins is a very smart defenseman; he has good vision and good offensive instincts. He can read the play well, and his passing ability allows him to be a constant threat in the transition game. I like his poise under pressure, something I feel extremely important in a young defenseman.\" - Morreale\n\n\"Has crept into my top 10 and is well deserving of it. With a lot of draft eligible players having up and down spurts this year, Timmins might just be the most consistent of the bunch. From the get go this year, he's been the Greyhounds' best defender (on a team with two 19 year old NHL drafted blueliners). Timmins is just an exceptionally well rounded player who is actually close to being pro ready IMO. Makes a great first pass, brings intensity to the defensive end and skates well.\" - Otten\n\n\"A prototypical new age defender who is an elite puck mover. Timmins was born to play in the system the greyhounds have and has thrived in it. With 2 NHL defenders ahead of him at the start of the season Timmins has seemingly passed them on the depth chart and has been an important offensive cog with the high scoring Greyhounds. Another late birthday who made his OHL debut last season Timmins thrived in protected minutes finishing 3rd among rookies in +/- ( I know it is flawed stat but impressive given his age). This season in more leveraged minutes against high quality competition he hasn't missed a beat and is currently 6th in the league in that category and first among Draft Eligibles. He also leads draft eligibles in assists.\" - Kneulman\n\n\"One of the big risers in my opinion. Timmins plays in any situation for the Greyhounds. Despite being “only” 6’1” he plays with the physical intensity of someone more like 6’5”. He does not shy away from the physical battles in corners, along the boards or in front of his own goal. He can and does throw open ice hits. Offensively, Timmins thinks the game very well and along with his vision makes him dangerous from the point. Whether its finding seams to set up teammates or getting a diversity of shots through to the goal, he is very proficient. He quarterbacks the powerplay exceptionally well. He leads all draft eligible defencemen points and plus/minus. By the time the season is over, he could be challenging Hague.\" - Tiano\n\n**Mackenzie Entwistle - Forward - Hamilton Bulldogs (7 Votes)**  \nHighest Ranking: 7th (3x)  \nComments:  \n\"Coming down with Mono this week will likely hurt him as his play has some what flat lined in the new year. Still he is a strong two-way winger with untapped offensive potential. Shows great drive and a willingness to go in the dirty areas but the skill to score outside of them. My only fear with him is a team drafts him and brings up to the NHL too so to cheaply fill a bottom 6 role thus stunting his development by having him play a more physical role similar to Tom Wilson. While I feel he could thrive in that role he has too much offensive potential and if he is given time to develop could be a real treat to watch in the coming years.\" - Kneulman\n\n\"While he may lack high-end puck skills and lateral mobility, he is a strong north-south skater with smarts who works hard at both ends of the ice.  He looks like a safe bet to one day play in the NHL...the question will be on what line?\" - McCagg\n\n\"The offensive numbers have really declined in recent months and he's dropping like a stone on a lot of draft lists. But I've still got him at the back end of my top 10. The Top Prospect's Game was a great showcase for him. Still think he's got more offensive potential and better hands than people give him credit for. As he fills out, I think he could be a real force at both ends of the ice. If Hamilton falters in the OHL playoffs, I really hope he plays a large role for Canada at the U18's, where I think he could really shine.\" - Otten\n\n\"A big frame that understands the game as well as some coaches...Excellent on the PK and defensively while his offensive game is developing.\" - Seidel\n\n**Morgan Frost - Forward - Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds (6 Votes)**  \nHighest Ranking: 7th (1x)  \nComments:  \n\"There seems to be a theme in the OHL with less-heralded players spring boarding into top draft prospect discussions, and Frost is certainly one of them. Not only was he a fourth round pick in the 2015 Priority Selection, but he plays on a roster loaded with NHL draftees. But there he is, second in team scoring with 42 points and centering either of the Soo’s top two lines. Frost is an outstanding set-up man who can thread the needle, but he’s guilty of forcing passes while operation in the Greyhounds’ struggling power play.\" - Kournianos\n\n\"I thought Frost was a nice story last year. The son of a famous PA Announcer playing OHL hockey. I did not think more of him.  Then he showed the work ethic, skill set and a little bit of a jam to really differentiate himself as a player on an outstanding team.  A bit of a sleeper.  I don't think he gets drafted 1st round, but is great value in the 2nd round.  And yes, you can see elements of his dad Andy's voice when he talks!\" - Clark\n\n\"Frost has been a very pleasant surprise for me. He's always had good hands and is great with puck possession. He's improved his speed and strength this season, allowing him to beat defenders in a variety of ways. He's an underrated play maker who is confident with the puck. If he gets a little more size, he becomes a player with intriguing upside at the next level.\" - Scheig\n\n\"Frost as the ability to score in a multitude of ways and that versatility has allowed him to work his way up the depth chart on a very deep Greyhounds team. His strong play helped the team overcome the loss of Blake Speers early in the season. He has a great shot and an ability to find open spaces on the ice that has allowed him to thrive on the power play. At times he has played the point on the power play for the Hounds this year only to come up with a great defensive play to prevent a short handed opportunity. Can affect the game even when he isn't scoring and has the upside of a 2nd line scoring winger at the next level.\" - Kneulman\n\n**Markus Phillips - Defense - Owen Sound Attack (3 Votes)**  \nHighest Ranking: 8th (1x)  \nComments:  \n\"Phillips has made real strides in his overall game this season. I wanted to see more offense in his game and he has started to bring that. He couples that with a very responsible game in his own end, making smart decisions. He's a little undersized, but strong. He has the kind of game that can translate well to the next level, once he fills out and continues to add offense.\" - Scheig\n\n\"Slightly undersized, but I don't think that hurts Phillips because he's got very good lower body strength and a wide base. While many seem to be touting Phillips as an offensive type of defender, I actually see him being more of a shut down type at the next level. He's one of the OHL's more agile defenders, moving exceptionally well backwards and laterally, and it makes him very difficult to beat one on one. His overall defensive awareness is strong too. And when you add in his great leadership potential and poise, I think you've got the makings of a Marc-Edouard Vlasic type of player.\" - Otten\n\n**Adam Ruzicka - Forward - Sarnia Sting (2 Votes)**  \nHighest Ranking: 5th (1x)  \nComments:  \n\"It’s been a grind-it-out kind of season for this towering Slovakian two-way center, who is putting together a solid rookie season when you consider 26 of his 32 points have come in the last 30 games. It took Ruzicka a few weeks to adapt to North American hockey, and a solid showing at the WJC as one of Slovakia’s younger forwards seems to have spring boarded him into a productive second half. He is prone to make odd decisions with the puck, but we chalk it up to trying to adapt to a new league and zip code.\" - Kournianos\n\n\"His hockey sense and vision allow him to have success playing all three forward positions. He's just as capable setting up plays as he is finishing them and possesses an excellent touch around the net. He moves very well for his size (6-3, 202) and has deceptive speed.\" - Morreale\n\n**Jason Robertson - Forward - Kingston Frontenacs (2 Votes)**  \nHighest Ranking: 6th (2x)  \nComments:  \n\"Despite strong size, Robertson isn’t an overwhelming on-ice presence. Still, he has been the brightest spot on a low-scoring Frontenacs team as its top offensive threat.

Arizona Coyotes - Nico Hischier, C, Halifax (QMJHL)**\n\nThe Switzerland-born left-shot forward (6-1, 176) has elite hockey sense, a nice scoring touch and underrated edge to his game. He excelled as an underage player for Switzerland at the 2017 IIHF World Junior Championship with four goals and three assists in five games. He has been dominant for Halifax with 64 points (32 goals, 32 assists) in 38 games.\n\n**3\\. Vegas Golden Knights - Gabriel Vilardi, C, Windsor (OHL)**\n\nWith their first draft pick, the Golden Knights could select a puck-possessing workaholic with skilled hands and outstanding awareness. A right-shot forward, Vilardi (6-3, 201) has excellent hockey sense and puck-handling ability, is very composed with the puck and able to influence the game in all three zones.\n\n**4\\. New York Islanders - Owen Tippett, RW, Mississauga (OHL)**\n\nTippett (6-1, 202), the cousin of Tampa Bay Lightning prospect Mitchell Stephens, is an exceptionally strong skater and shooter. He knows where to go on the ice to properly give or receive a pass and has an NHL-caliber shot and release.\n\n**5\\. Buffalo Sabres - Michael Rasmussen, C, Tri-City (WHL)**\n\nHe knows how to use his 6-foot-6, 215-pound frame to his fullest advantage. He has shown more confidence this season with 51 points (30 goals, 21 assists) in 46 games. Does a fine job getting to the dirty areas to provide screens and get deflections, and knows how to protect the puck with his reach.\n\n![](https://cms.nhl.bamgrid.com/images/photos/285905250/1284x722/cut.jpg)\n\n**6\\. Winnipeg Jets - Casey Mittelstadt, C, Eden Prairie (HIGH-MN)**\n\nThe University of Minnesota recruit has elite puck skills, NHL quickness, and has excelled at every level. Mittelstadt (6-1, 201) was MVP of the USA Hockey All-American Top Prospects Game in September, had 21 points (eight goals, 13 assists) in 16 games with Green Bay of the United States Hockey League early in the season, and now is the leading scorer for his high school team.\n\n**7\\. Detroit Red Wings - Juuso Valimaki, D, Tri-City (WHL)**\n\nThe two-way defenseman has brought more assertiveness to his game in his second WHL season. Valimaki (6-1, 204) has 39 points (12 goals, 27 assists) in 38 games and has shown more offensive drive and confidence in his game.\n\n**8\\. Dallas Stars - Eeli Tolvanen, RW, Sioux City (USHL)**\n\nHe has plenty of speed, hockey sense and intensity to complement a solid skill set and NHL-caliber release. Tolvanen (5-10, 170), born in Finland, will attend Boston College in 2017-18. He leads Sioux City in goals (16), points (29), game-winning goals (four) and shots on goal (134) in 26 games.\n\n**9\\. New Jersey Devils - Cody Glass, C, Portland (WHL)**\n\nThe versatile 6-foot-2, 180-pound right-shot center plays all three forward spots but is better in the middle because he has a constant motor and is an opportunist in the offensive zone. He has good hands and playmaking ability with a style of play that has been compared to Boston Bruins center [Patrice Bergeron](https://www.nhl.com/player/patrice-bergeron-8470638).\n\n**10\\. Tampa Bay Lightning - Klim Kostin, C/LW, Dynamo Moscow (RUS)**\n\nA big (6-3, 196), strong left-shot forward with very good puck control and skating ability. He knows how to use his size and strength when skating toward the net and has good drive and determination. He's expected to miss about three months because of a shoulder injury.\n\n**11\\. Nashville Predators - Elias Pettersson, C, Timra (SWE-2)**\n\nPettersson (6-1, 156) is gaining plenty of experience with and against men in Allsvenskan, Sweden's second division, where at 18 he leads Timra with 27 points (12 goals, 15 assists) in 27 games. He has good vision and hands and is considered more of a playmaker. He can play wing or center, and can effectively run a power play.\n\n![](https://cms.nhl.bamgrid.com/images/photos/285905580/1284x722/cut.jpg)\n\n**12\\. Florida Panthers - Ryan Poehling, C, St. Cloud State (NCHC)**\n\nThe 6-2, 183-pound forward brings speed and smarts and seems to make things happen at the right time. He generates offense in clutch situations, and is close to being the complete package despite being the youngest player in the NCAA; he turned 18 on Jan. 3.\n\n**13\\. Vancouver Canucks - Lias Andersson, C, HV 71 (SWE)**\n\nAn excellent skater with speed and good first-step quickness. He's always on the move and can create scoring chances with his mobility, good hands and grit. His father, Niklas Andersson, played 165 NHL games and now is an amateur scout in Europe for the Los Angeles Kings.\n\n**14\\. Los Angeles Kings - Cale Makar, D, Brooks (AJHL)**\n\nMakar (5-11, 179), winner of the 2015-16 Alberta Junior Hockey League and Canadian Junior Hockey League Rookie of the Year, has continued his stellar play and development. He's a dynamic skater with quickness and elusiveness with or without the puck.\n\n**15\\. Carolina Hurricanes - Kristian Vesalainen, LW/RW, Frolunda (SWE)**\n\nBorn in Helsinki, Vesalainen (6-3, 207) is a power forward with great offensive skills. He's a very mobile skater, smart, has a good feel for the game and is a hard working two-way player. He has split the season between Frolunda and HPK in Liiga, Finland's top professional league.\n\n**16\\. Philadelphia Flyers - Urho Vaakanainen, D, JYP (FIN)**\n\nAn intelligent, two-way defender (6-0, 185) who can read the play well, has good vision and a strong skill set that includes skating, passing and an accurate shot. He is a reliable team player and has a sound defensive game.\n\n![](https://cms.nhl.bamgrid.com/images/photos/285905694/1284x722/cut.jpg)\n\n**17\\. Ottawa Senators - Martin Necas, C, Brno (CZREP)**\n\nNecas (6-0, 167) is an excellent skater with a fine set of tools. He was captain for the Czech Republic at the 2016 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Cup in August and had two goals and four assists in four games. He's fast, has great balance and has confidence in his ability to score and create opportunities. \n\n**18\\. Toronto Maple Leafs - Callan Foote, D, Kelowna (WHL)**\n\nThe 6-3, 213-pound son of former NHL defenseman Adam Foote probably won't be the physical presence his father was, but plays all situations and uses his smarts, reach and strength to contain his opponent and gain position. \n\n**19\\. Boston Bruins - Nicolas Hague, D, Mississauga (OHL)**\n\nHague (6-5, 206) is a fluid skater and can move the puck extremely well, enabling his team to create a lot of offense. He also has five power-play goals, second on Mississauga. The left-shot defenseman also is tough in the defensive end.\n\n**20\\. Calgary Flames - Timothy Liljegren, D, Rogle (SWE)**\n\nLiljegren (6-0, 191) missed two months because of mononucleosis earlier in the season but is a solid prospect with great upside. He's calm, smart and creative, and can move the puck with authority.   \n\n**21\\. St. Louis Blues - Maxime Comtois, LW, Victoriaville (QMJHL)**\n\nComtois (6-2, 199) is most comfortable at right wing, but can play any forward position; as a center he has won 50.4 percent of the 272 faceoffs he has taken. He can be used in all situations because of his size and speed. He is highly skilled but also highly competitive and plays the game with an edge.\n\n![](https://cms.nhl.bamgrid.com/images/photos/284466954/1284x722/cut.jpg)\n\n**22\\. San Jose Sharks - Nick Suzuki, C, Owen Sound (OHL)**\n\nSuzuki (5-11, 187) has 56 points (23 goals, 33 assists) and a plus-28 rating in 43 games, all improvements from the 20 goals, 38 points and minus-15 he had in 63 games last season as an OHL rookie. He's versatile, has high-end hockey sense and vision and is a gifted passer and underrated finisher.\n\n**23\\. Edmonton Oilers - Kailer Yamamoto, RW, Spokane (WHL)**\n\nYamamoto (5-7, 153) will create excitement. He's hockey-strong, can make contact and knock people off the puck, can protect it and win battles. Scouts like the fact he brings a game-breaker element to each shift.\n\n**24\\. New York Rangers - Filip Westerlund, D, Frolunda (SWE)**\n\nHis hockey sense, puck control and intelligence stand out the most to scouts. Westerlund (5-11, 179) has poise and makes smart decisions. He averages 12 minutes per game on a strong Frolunda team.\n\n**25\\. Anaheim Ducks - Matthew Strome, LW, Hamilton (OHL)**\n\nStrome (6-3, 206) is bigger and stronger than his older brothers, forwards [Ryan Strome](https://www.nhl.com/player/ryan-strome-8476458) of the New York Islanders and Dylan Strome of the Arizona Coyotes. The youngest Strome brother is strong down low and is skilled at using his body to protect the puck. He's very hard to check, has excellent hockey IQ and is a good finisher.\n\n![](https://cms.nhl.bamgrid.com/images/photos/281307518/1284x722/cut.jpg)\n\n**26\\. Pittsburgh Penguins - Nikita Popugaev, LW, Prince George (WHL)**\n\nThe right-shot forward from Moscow has said he compares his style to Pittsburgh Penguins center [Evgeni Malkin](https://www.nhl.com/player/evgeni-malkin-8471215). Popugaev (6-5, 204) has developed his game well in his second WHL season, with 57 points (24 goals, 33 assists) in 48 games. He has an excellent combination of size and skill, and uses his reach very well.\n\n**27\\. Montreal Canadiens - Jesper Boqvist, C, Timra (SWE-2)**\n\nThe left-shot forward has great speed with offensive skill. He had 12 points (three goals, nine assists) in 19 games with Timra on loan from Brynas in the Swedish Hockey League, where he returned earlier this month. Boqvist (6-0, 179) is a very good skater with good first-step quickness and balance. He's a skilled puck carrier, and effective in traffic. \n\n**28\\. Chicago Blackhawks - Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen, G, HPK Jr. (FIN)**\n\nLuukkonen (6-4, 196), often compared to [Pekka Rinne](https://www.nhl.com/player/pekka-rinne-8471469) of the Nashville Predators, plays an effective butterfly style, is strong in the crease and can control rebounds. He won a gold medal with Finland at the 2016 IIHF World Under-18 Championship, winning the final three games with a 2.00 goals-against average and .917 save percentage.\n\n**29\\. Minnesota Wild - Henri Jokiharju, D, Portland (WHL)**\n\nIn his first season in North America, Jokiharju (6-0, 176) has performed very well, with 31 points (six goals, 25 assists) in 44 games. He's an excellent skater, elusive with the puck and can beat the forecheck with a pass or his feet. He had three assists in seven games to help Finland win the gold medal at the 2016 World U-18 Championship.\n\n**30\\. Washington Capitals - Isaac Ratcliffe, LW, Guelph (OHL)**\n\nRatcliffe (6-5, 196) is a prototypical power forward with a good scoring touch. He has 39 points (21 goals, 18 assists), a plus-10 rating and 53 penalty minutes in 44 games. \n\n**31\\. Columbus Blue Jackets - Stelio Mattheos, RW, Brandon (WHL)**\n\nMattheos (6-1, 190) picked up the offensive slack when Patrick was out because of injury. He was chosen No. 1 by Brandon in the 2014 WHL draft and is capable of doing a lot of things well. His 33 points (15 goals, 18 assists) in 43 games this season already has surpassed the 13 goals and 30 points he had in 50 games as a WHL rookie last season.\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.762383035Z","tags":null},"/reference/Sportsnets-2017-NHL-Draft-Prospect-Rankings-for-March-Sportsnet.ca":{"title":"Sportsnets 2017 NHL Draft Prospect Rankings for March - Sportsnet.ca","content":"\n# Sportsnets 2017 NHL Draft Prospect Rankings for March - Sportsnet.ca\n\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e In his March draft rankings, Jeff Marek takes a look at the movers and shakers as we're just a little more than three months away from the big day.\n\nJeff Marek\n\nMetadata: \n\n2017-03-08\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/juniors/sportsnets-2017-nhl-draft-prospect-rankings-march/)\n\n---\nWe’re a little more than three months away from the NHL Draft and the rankings continue to move around.\n\nTop prospect Nolan Patrick maintains his position atop our rankings, but it’s a crowded field behind him, with nine of the next 10 players moving position from our last rankings in January.\n\nHere are Sportsnet’s Top 31 NHL Draft Rankings for the month of March, with the player’s last ranking in parentheses.\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowneutral.png)**1\\. (1) Nolan Patrick, C – Brandon Wheat Kings (WHL):** Since returning from injury has shown that he deserved to stay atop draft lists. Does everything so well, not flashy but has a pro style about him already. Think Jonathan Toews-lite.\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowup.png)**2\\. (3) Nico Hischier, C – Halifax Mooseheads (QMJHL):** Popped big at the WJC and CHL Top Prospects game, but has tailed off slightly. Was injured and since returning has played a slightly different game. Some scouts worry about some of the fatigue he’s shown, but his skills more than compensate.\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowdown.png)**3\\. (2) Timothy Liljegren, D – Rogle U20 (SuperElit):** A strong Five Nations Tournament alleviated all fears that his game was slipping. For most teams he is the best defenceman in this year’s draft.\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowup.png)**4\\. (6) Owen Tippett, RW – Mississauga Steelheads (OHL):** Injured at Top Prospects game and played hurt until docs shut him down. Consistently finds scoring chances and goals every game. Pure sniper.\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowneutral.png)**5\\. (5) Gabe Vilardi, C/RW – Windsor Spitfires (OHL):** Probably Windsor’s most consistent player this season. Plays wing, but is a natural centre and has played a few games at that position. Almost a full year younger than Nolan Patrick.\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowup.png)**6\\. (8) Casey Mittelstadt, C – Eden Prairie (Minnesota High School):** Was over a point per game player in the USHL and since going back to play high school hockey at Eden Prairie he’s more than doubled that rate of production.\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowdown.png)**7\\. (4) Eeli Tolvanen, LW – Sioux City Musketeers (USHL):** Heating back up again in the USHL. One of the top pure snipers in the draft this season.\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowup.png)**8\\. (10) Martin Necas, C – HC Kometo Brno (Extraliga):** Plays a very confident two-way game. Defensively responsible, has a great engine and doesn’t tire.\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowup.png)**9\\. (11) Michael Rasmussen, C – Tri-City Americans (WHL):** A wrist injury will cost him three months, but scouts still rave. Rasmussen can score goals and for a 6-foot-5 player, scouts are impressed at how well he gets around the ice. Has been great on the PP.\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowup.png)**10\\. (12) Cale Makar, D – Brooks Bandits (AJHL):** Elusive and agile, can skate the puck out of trouble. Processes the game quickly and can run a power play.\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowdown.png)**11\\. (9) Nicholas Hague, D – Mississauga Steelheads (OHL):** Plays in all situations, can anchor a PP. Some scouts think skating still an issue, others not that concerned about his feet. Very poised, well controlled now.\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Hague_AB42720.jpg)\n\nNicolas Hague, pictured above.

(14) Lias Andersson, C – HV71 (SHL):** Had a production dip after the WJC, but has been on fire of late putting up big points in the SHL.\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowup.png)**13\\. (18) Miro Heiskanen, D – HIFK (Liiga):** Has had just about all the teams picking in the top 10 following him lately. Could be a big riser come draft day.\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowdown.png)**14\\. (13) Juuso Valimaki, D – Tri-City Americans (WHL):** A good all-around blueliner who’s enjoyed great experience at the junior and international level. Not huge, but possesses great awareness. Has drawn comparisons to Olli Juolevi (VAN).\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowup.png)**15\\. (19) Cal Foote, D – Kelowna Rockets (WHL):** Will be a 12-year NHLer. A really solid, safe pick.\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowneutral.png)**16\\. (16) Cody Glass, C – Portland Winterhawks (WHL):** Has enjoyed a meteoric rise up the draft rankings since the start of the season. Great skater, skilled playmaker and joins the impressive list of high-end players coming out of Portland.\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowup.png)**17\\. (20) Erik Brannstrom, D – HV71 U-20 (SuperElite):** NHL teams who favour a smart possession game will love Brannstrom. Undersized by traditional standards (5-foot-10, 179 pounds), but moves the puck great. At the Five Nations Tournament he played like every shift was his last and tried to make something happen every time he was out there. Scouts noticed.\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowdown.png)**18\\. (7) Klim Kostin, RW – Balashikha (MHL):** Shoulder surgery has ended what’s been a challenging draft season for the Russian forward.\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowdown.png)**19\\. (15) Maxime Comtois, LW – Victoriaville Tigres (QMJHL):** His play has picked up since Pascal Laberge returned, but his scoring is still off. Still, scouts see a lot of potential here.\n\n![Maxime Comtois; Victoriaville Tigres; QMJHL; CHL; 2017 NHL Draft; Top Prospect; Sportsnet](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GettyImages-614361086.jpg)\n\nMaxime Comtois of the Victoriaville Tigres is a top-rated prospect for the 2017 NHL Draft. (Mathieu Belanger/Getty)\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowup.png)**20\\. (22) Kailer Yamamoto, RW – Spokane Chiefs (WHL):** A shifty, dynamic scorer who has a great shot at winning the WHL scoring title next season. Lacks size (5-foot-9), but such a skilled player.\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowdown.png)**21\\. (17) Kristian Vesalainen, RW, Frolunda (SHL):** Scouts like the size and potential, but the lack of production concerns many.\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowdown.png)**22\\. (21) Urho Vaakanainen, D – JYP (Liiga):** Shines on the defensive side of the puck at even strength and PK. Has an uncanny ability to get his stick in shooting and passing lanes. Just don’t expect offence. He won’t be out there late in a game to tie it up, but you’ll love him out there protecting a lead.\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowup.png)**23\\. (25) Nick Suzuki, C – Owen Sound Attack (OHL):** A high hockey IQ and very little panic in his game. Versatile player: They use him on both the first unit PP and PK in Owen Sound.\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/suzuki_nick.jpg)\n\nNick Suzuki (Terry Wilson/OHL Images)\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowdown.png)**24\\. (23) Ryan Poehling, C, St. Cloud State (NCAA):** Playing as a true freshman is challenging, but this hard-working, two-way centre is working through it. Got off to a slow start, but has improved steadily all season. Competes hard and has offensive skill.\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowup.png)**25\\. (26) Robert Thomas, C – London Knights (OHL):** Best comparison is to former Knight Bo Horvat and it’s not off.\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowdown.png)**26\\. (24) Shane Bowers, C, Waterloo Blackhawks (USHL):** Doesn’t have one thing that stands out about his game, but is good at a number of things. Plays the full rink and brings a strong work ethic to every game.\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowup.png)**27\\. (30) Elias Pettersson, C – Timra (SuperElite):** Playing in Sweden he’s been lights out, but internationally it’s a different story where he’s struggled, most recently at the world juniors. The team that drafts him will have to be patient, but he has the tools to make their patience pay off.\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowneutral.png)**28\\. (27) Matthew Strome, LW – Hamilton Bulldogs (OHL):** Such a smart player whose main calling card is his high-end hockey sense. He’s never been the best skater, but always produces. Loaded with potential.\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowup.png)**29\\. (NR) Kole Lind, C – Kelowna Rockets (WHL):** Joins the list of top forwards coming out of the Rockets organization like Nick Merkley (ARI) and Dillon Dube (CGY). He’s a playmaker who can also find the back of the net and isn’t shy about playing physical either.\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowneutral.png)**30\\. (29) Nikita Popugaev, LW – Prince George Cougars:** Second generation player (dad played for Moscow Dynamo) who turned some heads at the Top Prospects game. His production has tailed off since his torrid start, but plays with some high-end talent with the Cougars and should enjoy a long playoff run.\n\n![](https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arrowup.png)**31\\. (NR) MacKenzie Entwistle, C – Hamilton Bulldogs (OHL):** Played at the CHL Top Prospects game with mono and impressed scouts with skill and work ethic. Has a real pro presentation both on and off the ice. Plays in all situations and seems comfortable in all of them. Perhaps the most low maintenance player in the entire CHL. A coach’s dream.\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.762383035Z","tags":null},"/reference/Stanley-Cup-Contender-Checklist-Analyzing-the-rosters-from-the-last-decade-of-champions":{"title":"","content":"\n# Cup Checklist: Analyzing the rosters from the last decade of champions - The Athletic\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e There are lessons to be learned from past winners; guidelines for how a team’s roster should be made up.\n\nDom Luszczyszyn\n\nMetadata: \nBoston Bruins,Chicago Blackhawks,Los Angeles Kings,Pittsburgh Penguins,St. Louis Blues,Washington Capitals,NHL\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](https://theathletic.com/2077279/2020/09/21/cup-checklist-analyzing-the-rosters-from-the-last-decade-of-champions/)\n\n---\nThere’s no exact formula for winning the Stanley Cup. The [Lightning](https://theathletic.com/team/lightning/) have been a popular pick to win it all for years, but it took them five years since their last Stanley Cup Final berth to make it back. Few would have picked the [Stars](https://theathletic.com/team/stars/) this season, especially with their starting goaltender injured, but they found a way and now they’re three wins away from being champions.\n\nBuilding a roster to win it all isn’t easy, and even building a good team often isn’t enough in a sport with as much chaotic energy as hockey. But there are lessons to be learned from past winners; guidelines for how a team’s roster should be made up. Stylistically they all differ, but from a total value perspective, there are similar elements that can be looked upon as goals for roster-building. The last two Cup winners were led by an elite centre worth roughly three wins, but there’s a big difference between the way Ryan O’Reilly and [Nicklas Backstrom](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/capitals/nicklas-backstrom/) play, for example.\n\nAn elite top line centre being a prerequisite to winning the Stanley Cup shouldn’t come as a huge surprise; it’s a talking point that’s been championed for a long time. Over the past decade only one team, the 2011 [Bruins](https://theathletic.com/team/bruins/), won the Stanley Cup without a projected top line centre. [David Krejci](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/bruins/david-krejci/) was just on the cusp and [Patrice Bergeron](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/bruins/patrice-bergeron/) hadn’t hit his full stride yet as one of the game’s best two-way players. However, both played at that level come playoff time. \n\nOn average, the top centre on a Stanley Cup winning team is worth around 3.8 wins in the regular season; that’s by far the most important piece for a contender. But there’s more to the puzzle than just one player.\n\nThis isn’t a new study by any means, it’s one I did for [The Hockey News](https://www.si.com/hockey/news/eight-simple-rules-for-building-a-stanley-cup-contender) four years ago and one that Cam Lawrence – who works for the [Florida Panthers](https://theathletic.com/team/fla-panthers/) – [also did](https://canucksarmy.com/2015/08/21/building-a-contender-part-5-conclusion/), but it’s worth diving into it again with more data. This time around, I’m armed with projected values for each player at the time of the playoffs to better assess their true talent level, plus a couple extra seasons of results. I’ll also be looking at each position on the depth chart, not just the core players, to give a better idea of where certain players should fit on a Cup-contending roster.\n\nIt’s not just the average that matters, though. It would be foolish to treat 3.8 wins for a top line centre as a “you must be this tall to ride” measuring stick – it’s a range. No team is ever average or above relative to a Cup winner at every position on the roster and having a range of acceptable values helps illustrate where a player falls and how far off a team is. It’s even OK to be below average in a few areas. The key is to make up ground elsewhere and build a roster with as few concessions as possible.\n\nIt should be noted as well that rather than averaging out by left and right wingers or defencemen, the best wingers or defencemen on a given line or pair were grouped together. While most Cup winners are predominantly stronger on the right side, that distinction probably doesn’t matter and this properly groups [Alex Ovechkin](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/capitals/alex-ovechkin/) with [Patrick Kane](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/blackhawks/patrick-kane/) and [John Carlson](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/capitals/john-carlson/) with [Duncan Keith](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/oilers/duncan-keith/), rather than with [Brandon Saad](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/blues/brandon-saad/) and [Michal Kempny](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/capitals/michal-kempny/), respectively. \n\nHere’s how the roster for a Stanley Cup winner looks, with an acceptable range of one standard deviation on either side.\n\n[![](https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2020/09/18144149/Screen-Shot-2020-09-18-at-2.42.23-PM.png)](https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2020/09/18144149/Screen-Shot-2020-09-18-at-2.42.23-PM.png)\n\nBased on the above chart, a team that fancies itself a contender is looking at the following checklist in terms of top of the lineup players.\n\n-   Elite first-line centre that’s among the very best players in the world.\n-   Elite first-line winger to support the elite centre.\n-   Two other top-line wingers on each of the top two lines.\n-   Top-line centre to play behind the elite centre. \n-   Two more top-six forwards for depth in the middle six.\n-   Elite No. 1 defenceman.\n-   A second No. 1 defenceman to play behind him. \n-   A top pairing defenceman to help anchor a strong second pair with the No. 2. \n-   Another top-pairing calibre defender to crush soft minutes on the third pair. \n-   A top 10 calibre starting goaltender.\n\nAnd that’s without mentioning two capable third-liners, another steady top four defenceman who can play on the top pair, and making sure no one on the fourth line or bottom pair is replacement level. It’s a tall order, especially making sure all the pieces fit together beyond numbers on a page. Chemistry matters.\n\nSo while that’s a handy checklist under ideal circumstances, there’s no hard-and-fast rule. That’s where the ranges come in. A team can get away with not meeting the criteria in one area if they surpass it elsewhere and certain areas are more negotiable than others. Only the elite center (9/10), elite defenceman (officially 8/10, but one of the misses is because Keith had an off year), and top pairing defenceman on the second pair (9/10) were found on 80 percent of the champions. Every other archetype on the checklist was there six out of 10 times.\n\nA top 10 goalie would be great, but as long as he’s an above average starter it’s probably fine, especially with a strong defence in front of him. Having an elite winger on the top line is ideal, but a team can probably get away with someone that’s a shade below if they have strong depth in the middle six. \n\nThere’s other lessons that can be gleaned from this too, and those are the areas that are probably _not_ worth sweating over. Three areas come to mind: third-line center, top pair next to the star and the fourth line.\n\nDepth down the middle is crucial to building a Cup contender, but on average 86 percent of the value is confined to the top two centres. The past 10 Cup winners have been built off strong duos (O’Reilly/Schenn, Backstrom/Kuznetsov, Crosby/Malkin, Kopitar/Carter, Krejci/Bergeron). Meanwhile, only [Tyler Bozak](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/blues/tyler-bozak/), [Nick Bonino](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/sharks/nick-bonino/) and [Mike Richards](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/capitals/mike-richards/) were considered to be centres above third-line calibre. The same goes for the wingers. Only 14 out of 30 third-liners were top six calibre.\n\nThere’s also the idea that a team’s cornerstone defenceman needs to play with another top pairing guy to maximize the top pair. But the beauty of most elite defencemen is they generally don’t need much help. We’re seeing that play out this year with [Victor Hedman](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/lightning/victor-hedman/) lugging around [Zach Bogosian](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/lightning/zach-bogosian/) or [Luke Schenn](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/canucks/luke-schenn/), but there’s some historical precedent to it. Sure there’s Keith with [Brent Seabrook](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/lightning/brent-seabrook/), but there’s also been [Zdeno Chara](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/islanders/zdeno-chara/) with [Dennis Seidenberg](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/islanders/dennis-seidenberg/), [Drew Doughty](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/kings/drew-doughty/) with [Willie Mitchell](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/fla-panthers/willie-mitchell/), John Carlson with Michal Kempny and [Alex Pietrangelo](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/golden-knights/alex-pietrangelo/) with [Joel Edmundson](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/canadiens/joel-edmundson/). Good, steady players that coaches can trust in tough minutes – but they’re players that really aren’t that difficult to find.\n\nLastly, the average fourth line for a Cup contender looks like … an average fourth line. There’s nothing special here aside from a few years of [Matt Cullen](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/penguins/matt-cullen/) being awesome. If there’s a place to cut corners on a roster it’s here, especially since teams can ramp up the ice time of the top six in the playoffs.\n\nBut there’s an even more important reason the fourth lines don’t matter nearly as much here, and it’s because of the other part of this average Cup contender equation: how the players actually perform in the playoffs. That detail is often underreported on the analytics side when it comes to investigating a player’s total value, but it’s an important one – especially in comparison to how those players are projected to perform.\n\nWhen the average first-line Cup-winning centre is projected to be worth 3.8 wins, that’s under the expectation of playing against an average team under average circumstances. But the playoffs are not that. They’re a gruelling grind against increasingly difficult competition where matchups become even more important in a seven-game series.\n\nSo top line centres on Cup winners don’t provide as much value as projected. In fact, they have the largest drop-off of any position on the depth chart, losing 0.9 wins of value. That’s a matter of goals being a lot harder to come by in the postseason and facing the toughest matchups night after night. \n\nThe lessened offence means most of the forwards lose value on average (about 0.3 wins worth) with none being hit harder than the fourth line. The trio already carries little value to begin with, and loses another 1.8 on top of that, meaning in the playoffs they provide sub-replacement level value on average. Again, it’s the matchups taking over as there are fewer places to hide a fourth line. With the top line and fourth line losing lots of value, the middle six on a Cup-winning team generally does pick up the slack; that’s possibly where the idea that a strong third-line centre is crucial to a championship-calibre team comes in. They get the second largest bump among forwards, suggesting it’s not that a team necessarily needs a strong third-line centre, but they do need one that can elevate his game in the playoffs. Though the Bruins didn’t win last year, [Charlie Coyle](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/bruins/charlie-coyle/)’s playoff excellence definitely comes to mind.\n\nAs for the defence, they’re dead even with projections on aggregate, but the value distribution changes dramatically. Most third pairs are a little better, while those usually strong second pairs really struggle relative to expectations on Cup-winning teams. Perhaps that’s due to them being used more often as shutdown pairs, but it’s certainly an interesting trend. \n\nThe top pair is where the biggest positive change comes from among a champion’s skaters. If you’re wondering why talking heads always wax poetic about the importance of having an elite No. 1 defender, it’s because of how they’ve generally elevated their game in the playoffs, becoming the most important skaters on the team when it matters most. On average, a team’s best defenceman has been 0.8 wins better in the playoffs, bringing their total value up to 3.3 wins on average (while top line centres drop to 2.9 wins). Pietrangelo, Carlson, Letang, Keith, Doughty, Chara all brought the heat in their Cup-winning seasons and unsurprisingly it’s Hedman and [Miro Heiskanen](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/stars/miro-heiskanen/) putting in work to lead Tampa Bay and Dallas to the final. Those types of defenders are the key to a lengthy playoff run.\n\nBut the most important player of all when it comes to the playoffs is, of course, the goalie, projected to be worth three wins, but earning closer to five on an average Cup winner.\n\n[![](https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2020/09/18152436/Screen-Shot-2020-09-18-at-3.23.50-PM.png)](https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2020/09/18152436/Screen-Shot-2020-09-18-at-3.23.50-PM.png)\n\nOn average, goalies on Cup-winning teams are _two_ _wins_ _better_ than projected. That says it all about building a Stanley Cup winning roster. A team can have the best group of skaters, but without a hot goalie, it’s tough to go very far. \n\nAs Mike Tyson once said, “everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.” In hockey that equates to the minute something goes wrong in between the pipes, essentially rendering any Cup checklist moot.\n\nGoaltending is by far the most important piece to any Cup-winning team and it’s no surprise that both [Andrei Vasilevskiy](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/lightning/andrei-vasilevskiy/) and [Anton Khudobin](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/stars/anton-khudobin/) have been very strong en route to their team’s respective final’s berth. The issue when it comes to goaltending is that it’s notoriously hockey’s most volatile position. That’s part of the chaos that’s bred in the postseason and it was only a year ago that Vasilevskiy was a big part of Tampa Bay’s demise, posting a grizzly .856 save percentage in the team’s four-game, first-round defeat. He’s turned the tables in these playoffs with a .931 save percentage and unsurprisingly, the team has followed.\n\nThese aren’t a strict set of rules, but they can be seen as guidelines based on past Cup winners. Any team checking a majority of the boxes should be well on their way to contending and with a little postseason luck on their side might hoist the Stanley Cup.\n\n_(Photo: Dave Sandford / NHLI via Getty Images)_\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.762383035Z","tags":null},"/reference/Stanley-Cup-contender-checklist-The-Athletic":{"title":"","content":"\n# Stanley Cup contender checklist: How does each playoff team stack up? – The Athletic\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e Referencing the Cup Checklist, we looked at what each NHL playoff team already has and what it still might need to be considered Cup-worthy.\n\nShayna Goldman, Dom Luszczyszyn\n\nMetadata: \nBoston Bruins,Tampa Bay Lightning,Toronto Maple Leafs,Florida Panthers,Carolina Hurricanes,New York Rangers,Pittsburgh Penguins,Washington Capitals,Dallas Stars,Colorado Avalanche,St. Louis Blues,Nashville Predators,Minnesota Wild,Calgary Flames,Edmonton Oilers,Los Angeles Kings,Vancouver Canucks,Vegas Golden Knights,NHL\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](https://theathletic.com/3186979/2022/03/16/stanley-cup-contender-checklist-how-does-each-playoff-team-stack-up/)\n\n---\n# \n\nStanley Cup contender checklist: How does each playoff team stack up?\n\n![DENVER, COLORADO - MARCH 13: Nazem Kadri #91 of the Colorado Avalanche skates against Trevor Lewis #22 of the Calgary Flames at Ball Arena on March 13, 2022 in Denver, Colorado.

Stylistically, there isn’t one right answer for how to build a team, as long as it’s constructed with good players that fit properly throughout the lineup.\n\nThe Stanley Cup recipe is a difficult one to master as there are different ways to interpret it, but looking at how it was cooked before offers some helpful patterns toward success. Based on a decade of championship meals from the 2010s, there are 10 common elements to look for when crafting a team worthy of contending. Every fine meal starts with a grocery list, and this one — the [Cup Checklist](https://theathletic.com/2077279/2020/09/21/cup-checklist-analyzing-the-rosters-from-the-last-decade-of-champions/) — is no different.\n\n-   Elite first-line center that’s among the very best players in the world.\n-   Elite first-line winger to support the elite center.\n-   Two other top-line wingers on each of the top two lines.\n-   Top-line center to play behind the elite center. \n-   Two more top-six forwards for depth in the middle six.\n-   Elite No. 1 defenseman.\n-   A second No. 1 defenseman to play behind him. \n-   A top-pairing defenseman to help anchor a strong second pair with the No. 2. \n-   Another top-pairing caliber defender to crush soft minutes on the third pair. \n-   A top-10 caliber starting goaltender.\n\nIt’s possible to make a great-tasting meal that’s Cup-worthy without every ingredient accounted for, but the best meals are the ones that have as many ingredients accounted for as possible. Not every team has it all, but the ones that have the most are the ones that are usually closest to competing for the Stanley Cup.\n\nSo does your team’s meal belong on Master Chef or Kitchen Nightmares? That’s the question teams have to be asking themselves going into the trade deadline because it’s the last chance to go to the market and improve their dish with a secret ingredient or two before it heads to the oven.\n\nEvery team will find themselves shopping over the next week with one common goal — to make the best meal possible. Some teams only need a finishing touch, some teams need spices to kick the flavor up a notch, and some teams are missing an entire side dish.\n\n\n### **Cup Checklist legend**\n\n_Gold Checkmark: Exceeds expectations, above acceptable range from average Cup-winner_ \n\n_Black Checkmark: Right on target, in line with average Cup-winner_\n\n_Grey Checkmark: Passable, below average relative to average Cup-winner_\n\n_Red X: A hole in the lineup, below acceptable range from average Cup-winner_\n\n\n\n### **Los Angeles**\n\n[![](https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/03/15153734/Screen-Shot-2022-03-15-at-3.33.51-PM.png)](https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/03/15153734/Screen-Shot-2022-03-15-at-3.33.51-PM.png)\n\nThe [Kings](https://theathletic.com/team/kings/) are one of this year’s biggest surprises and the model is still very steadfast that what we’re seeing out of them is a mirage. The depth remains a question mark across the board and the elite core simply isn’t what it needs to be to contend. It’s enough to be a playoff team — especially with the way [Viktor Arvidsson](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/kings/viktor-arvidsson/) and [Drew Doughty](https://theathletic.com/player/nhl/kings/drew-doughty/) have performed this year — but contending is a whole other ball game. Los Angeles isn’t ready for that yet. It might be worth pursuing some players with term — Jakob Chychrun comes to mind — but rentals should be out of the question. Either way, there shouldn’t be pressure to make a splash for this year’s playoffs.","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.762383035Z","tags":null},"/reference/reference-Kings-acquire-left-wing-Kevin-Fiala-from-Minnesota-Wild-Los-Angeles-Times":{"title":"","content":"\n# Kings acquire left wing Kevin Fiala from Minnesota Wild - Los Angeles Times\n\n\u003e ## Excerpt\n\u003e The Kings have acquired left wing Kevin Fiala from the Minnesota Wild for the rights to Brock Faber and their first-round pick in this year’s NHL draft.\n\nHelene Elliott\n\nMetadata: \n\n[[year of publishing]]\n[[Source Publication]]\n[Original Link](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-06-29/kings-acquire-left-wing-kevin-fiala-from-minnesota-wild)\n\n---\n ![Minnesota Wild forward Kevin Fiala skates in a game against the Philadelphia Flyers on March 3, 2022.](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8a2a5ff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3344x2275+317+80/resize/1200x817!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F13%2Fc7%2Ff186afa040e0a2d1cc91534d2372%2Fwild-kings-trade-hockey-61744.jpg)\n\nNew Kings forward Kevin Fiala, shown in a game against the Philadelphia Flyers on March 3, scored a career-high 33 goals for the Minnesota Wild this season.\n\n(Matt Slocum / Associated Press)\n\nUsing the depth of their prospect pool to fill immediate needs as they advance in their rebuilding process, [the Kings](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-06-16/kings-stanley-cup-finalists-avalanche-lightning) on Wednesday acquired left wing Kevin Fiala from the Minnesota Wild for the rights to defenseman Brock Faber and their first-round pick in this year’s NHL draft.\n\nThe Kings, who made the playoffs this season after missing out for three straight seasons and [lost to the Edmonton Oilers in seven games](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-05-14/kings-season-ends-game-7-loss-edmonton-oilers-nhl-playoffs), had been scheduled to pick 19th.

Alex Iafallo spent much of last season in that spot, but his long scoring droughts led to him being dropped in the lineup.\n\nFiala is listed at 5 feet 10 and 205 pounds and is known as a swift skater with excellent acceleration and game-breaking abilities. He was headed toward being a restricted free agent but reportedly signed a seven-year, $55.125-million contract with the Kings that carries an annual salary cap hit of $7.875 million. He was a teammate of Kings winger [Viktor Arvidsson](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-03-04/viktor-arvidsson-kings-blue-jackets-overtime-nhl) in Nashville for several seasons.\n\n[Subscribe to Continue Reading](https://edge.platform.latimes.com/v1/destination/1?int_source=marketing_content\u0026int_medium=MD\u0026int_campaign=LAFA22\u0026int_id=3437\u0026returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.latimes.com%2Fsports%2Fhockey%2Fstory%2F2022-06-29%2Fkings-acquire-left-wing-kevin-fiala-from-minnesota-wild\u0026content_id=00000181-b134-dc75-a1fd-b9f5e2230000\u0026int_content=fallback_paywall)\n\nA native of Switzerland, Fiala was chosen 11th in the 2014 draft by Nashville. He scored 45 goals for the Predators in 204 games before they traded him to the Wild. In 215 games with the Wild he scored 79 goals and 186 points, including career bests in goals (33), game-winning goals (seven) and points (85) this season. He has scored 124 goals and 283 points in 419 games over eight NHL seasons.\n\nThe Kings chose Faber 45th overall in the second round of the 2020 draft.

No. 2 center [Phillip Danault](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2021-08-11/kings-phillip-danault-new-home) made a strong impression in his Kings debut but ranked third with 51 points, behind Kopitar (67) and [Adrian Kempe](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-07-10/kings-adrian-kempe-agree-4-year-22-million-dollar-extension) (54).\n\nIt was imperative for Kopitar to lead the Kings in scoring as they built up to their 2012 and 2014 Stanley Cup championships, as they reached their peak, and then to keep them credible through their painful decline. A No. 1 center must carry his team, and Kopitar has done that at an elite level at both ends of the ice. Only Jeff Carter, in 2016-17, has interrupted the Slovenian center’s dominance since a 20-year-old Kopitar succeeded Michael Cammalleri as the team’s scoring leader in 2007-08.\n\nDanault hinted he could be their prime point producer when he scored a career-best 27 goals last season. Kempe more than doubled his career-high to score 35 goals but he’s a shooter and doesn’t pile up assists. Winger [Kevin Fiala](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-06-29/kings-acquire-left-wing-kevin-fiala-from-minnesota-wild) scored 33 goals and 85 points for Minnesota last season and could match or top that with extensive power play time. [Quinton Byfield](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2021-04-28/quinton-byfield-kings-nhl-debut-against-ducks) must prove he can handle a third-line center role before he can become an impact scorer.\n\nDoughty can see Kopitar being pushed. But not passed. “It’s going to be hard to beat Kopi in scoring, ever. He’s our No. 1 guy for all that type of stuff,” Doughty said. “Guys like Fiala or Kempe or Danault maybe have an opportunity to outscore him, but to be honest, I don’t really see it happening. I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s 15 of 16.”\n\nKopitar turned 35 in August, but he thinks the game quickly and doesn’t rely on speed alone. Danault’s arrival allowed coach Todd McLellan to drop Kopitar’s average ice time from 21 minutes 11 seconds to 20:46 last season, though Kopitar still led the Kings’ forwards and ranked third overall behind defensemen Doughty (25:44) and Matt Roy (20:59). He recorded a career-high 71 blocks and attempted 353 shots, his most since 2011-12, and won the Mark Messier Leadership Award.\n\n ![Kings center Anze Kopitar scores against Seattle Kraken goaltender Philipp Grubauer.](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2747e02/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3800x2533+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F76%2F22%2Fb06bcd114615ba5f0e3943a19913%2Fkraken-kings-hockey-99552.jpg)\n\nKings center Anze Kopitar scores against Seattle Kraken goalie Philipp Grubauer on March 26 at Crypto.com Arena.\n\n(Ashley Landis / Associated Press)\n\nMcLellan said Kopitar, Danault, Byfield and energetic center Blake Lizotte will dictate their playing time this season through their performances. Finding time for all of them would be a good problem to have.\n\n“Kopi is still a high-end player that’s capable of playing high-end minutes on our team or any other team in the league,” McLellan said. “You could drop him on the Stanley Cup champs and they’re going to play him those minutes because he’s a quality player.”\n\nKopitar, who has been the Kings’ captain since the “C” was awkwardly stripped from Dustin Brown in 2016, was grateful Danault took on some of his workload. But Kopitar isn’t conceding anything to age.\n\n“I feel good, I feel like I’m in good shape and still young enough to log all the minutes,” said Kopitar, who centered Fiala and Kempe during training camp and will skate alongside them to open the season.\n\n“Whoever wins the scoring title, it’s good for me or whoever it’s going to be. But it’s a matter of a team game. That’s what we’ve done in years past and that’s what we have to do. It’s a matter of making sure the team plays the way we need to play to make the playoffs, and then go deep and ultimately go all the way again.”\n\nSigning Danault as a free agent in 2021 was a morale-boosting move by general manager Rob Blake. It told players he recognized they’d made enough progress that investing in a top-six forward made strategic sense; Danault exceeded expectations and played a vital role in their return to the playoffs.\n\n[By acquiring Fiala](https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2022-06-29/kings-acquire-left-wing-kevin-fiala-from-minnesota-wild) and quickly signing him to a seven-year, $55.1-million contract Blake told players that they deserved to have another asset who could help them go beyond one playoff round next time.\n\n“The feeling’s good, obviously,” Kopitar said. “I think it was a big step last year, especially with all the injuries that went through this locker room throughout the season, and a much-needed gaining of experience. Because playing in a Game 7 it’s a different type of deal, versus being a 4-1 series \\[loss\\] or 4-0. The majority of young guys who hadn’t experienced that, they now know how it feels like and what to expect.”\n\nBrown’s retirement leaves Kopitar, Doughty and goaltender [Jonathan Quick](https://www.latimes.com/sports/newsletter/2022-05-02/jonathan-quick-kings-playoffs-sports-report) as the only holdovers from the Cup-winning teams. Doughty is signed through 2026-27 but Quick is in the final season of his contract and Kopitar is signed through 2023-24. The window for them to win together is narrowing.\n\n ![Kings center Anze Kopitar controls the puck against the Florida Panthers in March.](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/40dfbd7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2815x1877+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa5%2F8c%2F6457b16649a09a44679acffa2f51%2Fkings-preview-hockey-96376.jpg)\n\n(Ashley Landis / Associated Press)\n\nIt’s not shut, but there’s some urgency. “I really do think before the three of us retire we’ll have one more Cup in us, at least,” Doughty said.\n\nIt’s not impossible. But for it to happen soon, Kopitar must be his old self and his younger teammates must make a good run at taking the team scoring crown from him.\n\n“We’re on, I guess, maybe the old side of things right now but between me, Quickie and Drew, I think we still have quite a bit left,” Kopitar said.\n\n“With the young guys developing as fast and as good as they did, I think it’s most definitely an opportunity to win again.”\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T00:32:33.762383035Z","tags":null}}
